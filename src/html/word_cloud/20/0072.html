        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

The documents from your conference matched with everything in my report.
This thing is staged.
Rigged.
Whatever you want to call it.
I know.
I know I sound crazy but I didn't know you didn't know--Not until I read your journal.
Oh God, Paulo.
I just thought you were down here going through the motions so that the world could say, "we sent the experts."
You have to believe me.
I didn't know you felt that way about me.
I thought you had been instructed to feed me information and keep me close.
You know...a keep-the-enemy-close kind of thing.
But your journal...I saw you writing in it each day.
I didn't know what you were writing but I knew it wasn't official.
God, Paulo you are innocent in this.
I know that now.
I tried to make it right, I did.
I emailed my source at the CDC and informed h--" she paused momentarily and then continued, "informed the source that the operation here was legitimate in terms of its research.
You guys are actually trying to find a cure and actually care.
I'm so sorry that I didn't trust you or come to you.

Get better, BC," Edwards says, and leaves.
BC shifts on the couch, trying to get comfortable, but everything is sore.
Ouch!
Everything hurts.
Can't even really laugh.
God, I can't wait until I can talk again!
Got to report in to the Vatican, too.
I sent them a coded written report, but it's short on detail.
I've got to talk to them, explain things.
I'm sure they want some answers.
I need to ask some questions, too.
I've seen the news reports.
The Universal Islamic Nation's recent attacks on the Earth and the Moon were repelled with some success, but according to news reports the Vatican took a beating, hardest hit of all the Earth targets.
And of the areas on the Moon that were hit, their section, the Vatican Mission, was hit the hardest.
BC's rooms were nearly wiped out.
They're now attacking the Vatican directly.
The UIN has finally decided that the New catholic Church is provably, beyond a doubt, in bed with the Universal Trade Zone.
Well, duh.
It's been a long time coming.
The OPO's been working with the UTZ for what, five, six years?
