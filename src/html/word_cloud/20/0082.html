        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

If what we learnt from the DNA was generally known, we should have a lot of explaining to do.'
'And what was discovered in the DNA, Holiness?'
'My brothers, we learnt that the DNA we found is not human, nor belonging to any race known on this planet,' said the Pope, causing more uproar in the hall.
'Then those documents that we keep so well concealed about the origin of Jesus are actually true?
Jesus is a being from another world?'
'True, brother.
The interpretation given to the secret documents, which were nearly destroyed, was right.
Jesus is not of this world.
And if that were to become public knowledge nowadays, they would say that Jesus is an alien or something of the sort.
That would put the Holy Church at risk,' explained the Pope; and then one of the cardinals began to speak.
'Excuse me for interrupting, Your Holiness.
Even if DNA was found inside the Holy Grail, it seems unlikely that at the time the boy was conceived anyone would have been able to clone a being with DNA which doesn't even belong to this world.
Man only succeeded in cloning a mammal in 1996.'
'The brother is correct.
And for this reason I believe that this boy is a fraud,' concluded the Pope.
'Now we have to find a way of discrediting him, or else the Church may suffer harm.'
'Holy Father, our problem is solved.
All we have to do it to tell the world that we have the DNA of Jesus in our possession and confront the boy with it.
Make him undergo a test and this will prove he is a fake,' one cardinal proposed.
'And what if the boy agrees to take the test?

"What are you doing?"
she asked quietly, as if she were afraid to break the tension that hung between them.
"I came up here to say I was sorry."
But he didn't feel sorry anymore.
He felt...he felt like if he had to go another minute without her he would die.
He felt like every pore of his being needed to be buried inside her or he would crumble into a million pieces.
She turned to face him.
"You said it."
Her eyes burned into his with such intensity he had to look away.
To her mouth.
He wanted to kiss her, needed to kiss her.
Her lips quivered and she slicked a layer of moisture across the bottom one with her tongue, sending him over the edge.
"I'm going to kiss you," he whispered.
"But this time you can't push me away.
I won't be able to take it."
She didn't move, just stared at him with those world weary eyes, her lips parted ever so slightly, the rise and fall of her breasts tempting him that if he hooked his fingers through the fabric it would slide easily to the floor.
He stepped towards her.
The air in the small room was thick with moisture, it felt heavy and hot and damp.
He couldn't take his eyes off her lips, he wanted to taste them.
His mouth touched hers lightly, hesitantly.
