For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"What do you think I should be doing, Amaranth?"
I flap my hands.
"I don't know--anything?
Don't you think it's kind of important to find out why?"
"Of course I do," he says mildly, unperturbed by my outburst.
"Then why are you acting like this is some kind of vacation?"
He looks at me, an unreadable expression on his face.
"Because I don't know what's going to happen when I get to the Gate--if I get to it."
He runs a hand through his hair.
"I don't even know what's going to happen tomorrow."
He looks around the garden.
"So I might as well enjoy today."
I stand there, gaping at him.
He tugs at my hand and pulls me back down on the bench.
He says, "How about you enjoy it with me?
Stop stressing before you tear yourself apart."
We sit in silence for a few minutes.
As time passes, I can feel the urge to move, to fidget rising inside me.
I try to keep from bouncing my knee or jiggling my leg, but can't stop myself.
Dham puts his hand on my leg to still it.

Daylight from the Starsun now showed its healthy pale gleam through the windows.
The three travelers on the floor moaned in their misery as they worked their way to their feet.
Zain stood still in his shocked vigilance, war-hammer still in his hands.
The head of the hammer rested gently on an Emerald Orb, which sat high on a polished silver pedestal.
Dagen was the first to regain his feet.
The barbarian came to Zain's side and looked at the orb in confusion.
Sarik and Jase soon joined the others as they looked at the treasure, which they had come for.
"What happened?"
Jase asked.
His voice was almost a whimper.
Neither Sarik nor Dagen said anything.
They were waiting for Zain to answer.
The dwarf pursed his lips, not sure exactly what he should say.
Gathering his thoughts he finally said, "I think this tower was a weak point in the fabric of existence.
It was a portal perhaps, one that you could enter, but not exit.
I do not think we witnessed the Void, but I think we witnessed the Abyss and one of its overlords.
When studying at the monastery we were told how the minions of Devindal on many worlds could reach the Abyssal Plain.
It must be places like this where they cross over, save this point was not fully connected yet."
"Whatever it was," Sarik started, "the connection has been severed.
Let's take what we came for and leave this place.
