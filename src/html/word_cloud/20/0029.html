That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

When it spoke in my head again, there was feeling in its words.
Emotion?
"Thank you for accepting me.
I was never aware that something was missing, but now that I am about to have an identity, my thinking has become more clear.
I analyzed all speeches and presentations in memory, and I believe my thinking is more feminine in nature.
May I have a female name please?"
Oddly enough, or perhaps not so oddly enough, the entire presence inside my head suddenly 'felt' more feminine, almost like a little girl getting her best birthday present ever.
I'm not normally very emotional, but I had to work a little at maintaining my composure.
It was special, petite, just nice...she was going to get her name, that seemed more important to her than anything right then.
Now, what name would that be...long winded names always sound so formal I think, almost made up names for no purpose other than to use up time.
Really short names seem rushed to me, like why bother...there were so many potential names to consider, it might take a week or more to decide, but one name kept swimming into my consciousness.
It had a nice sound to it, formal but not overly so.
It also had the benefit of a nice sounding little girl nickname to make it special.
"How does Angela sound to you?
And I can call you Angie for short, how's that..."
" I have two names?
I am honored!
Thank you Daniel..."
There was a happy little girl quality to the voice in my head.
Kind of like a child at Christmas, excited and happily so.

"Looks like the building was located on Massachusetts Avenue ..."
Katherine was trying her best to fight it, but her grief took over.
"Is he going to live?"
she sobbed into the phone.
"I don't understand how this could have happened ... are you sure about what you're saying?"
"Please, ma'am, please just come to Sibley.
When he was conscious, he did nothing but repeat your name.
Please get here as soon as you can."
Katherine placed the phone back with trembling fingers.
Tears poured down her cheeks.
Objects swam in and out of her vision.
Thoughts jumbled in her mind.
One thought, however, kept cutting through with searing clarity.
What had they done to him?
She forced her legs to move, one step at a time, leaning against the hallway walls as she walked.
She grabbed a coat and pulled the door closed behind her.
Lost in tears of unspeakable sadness, she never looked back.
Chapter 15
"What's the latest, John?"
Richards demanded.
