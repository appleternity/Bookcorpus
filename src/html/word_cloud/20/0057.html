Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).

DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Sufficiency', 'tfidf': 1.178674765359375, 'lexical_unit': 'enough.n / enough.adv / enough.a / suffice.v / sufficient.a / sufficiently.adv / insufficient.a / insufficiently.adv / adequate.a / adequately.adv / insufficiency.n / adequacy.n / inadequacy.n / inadequate.a / inadequately.adv / plenty.n / plenty.adv / plenty.a / ample.a / too.adv / so.adv / serve.v', 'definition': "An Item is located on a Scale relative to a critical value which is determined by some Enabled_situation.

Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

Tammy watched as he walked out of the room.
She stretched out.
Last night was the best night's sleep she'd had since coming here.
Then that contract filled her mind.
She didn't want to sign, but if she was going to stick this out she didn't think she had much of a choice.
She pulled back the covers and her feet hit the soft cream carpet.
How life had changed in such a short amount of time.
The life she had once lived seemed like a distant memory.
She still missed the bookshop, she wondered if there was a chance she could go back to work, like she would even tell anyone about Dante, after all she would be exposing her Grandmother's secret too if she was to tell anyone.
Tammy shook her head, she wouldn't tell anyone anyway.
She was devoted to Dante and would never think of hurting him or his family.
Tammy walked into the bathroom and began to run the bath.
It had been a while since she'd had the time to relax.
From now on she wasn't going to let anything about Dante's life freak her out.
She was going to be strong and not allow anything to make him think she was about to leave him.
She couldn't leave him anyway.
Her feelings for him had seemed to of grown over night.
She wanted to be the perfect wife to him, she probably couldn't live up to his mother, and she would give it a good try.
Tammy felt refreshed after her bath and headed towards the kitchen as she grew closer she could hear voices.
"Tammy is not signing anything" Dante's voice boomed with a hint of annoyance.

"Block him out."
Cyril thought.
So he did.
Cyril imagined taking the girl in silence.
Leading her.
Holding her hand.
They would undress each other and he would shove her up against some wall in this byzantine structure.
Maybe in some deserted storage locker?
Maybe there's an old military cot in the back.
Behind the imaginary worker staring into the abyss as the black and white TV rattles in the foreground.
Just like a scene from TV.
Cyril imagined fucking her and having her smile back when finished.
They part both partially satisfied without emotion and without an uttered word.
He hoped she would be angry with him.
As his daydream slipped into real action, he noticed the cretins boarding the train.
"Fuck, got to hurry on the train.
The grand metal slug heaving to and fro, its impatience spewing humans onto the concrete.
The cycle is repeated over and over and over," Cyril recited mentally.
He really should write these down some day he thought.
He liked to think he would make a good poet.
