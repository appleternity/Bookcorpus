        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

"Me?
Abandon my pack?
I'm not the one who abandoned anything."
"So someone abandoned you?"
he surmised.
"A lovers tiff?"
"Oh yeah, you got me," she drawled, waving her hands in surrender.
"I'm that kind of female; the dramatic kind who turns rogue because someone was mean to her."
"I don't want that kind of trouble on my territory," Dean warned.
"No, you don't," she agreed.
"So, you should let me go."
"If your mate is about to turn up on my doorstep, he'll be sent packing."
"I don't have a mate."
Dean paused.
"So who abandoned you?"
Her mouth slammed shut again.
"For the love of ... this is ridiculous," he said, his patience unravelling.
"You need to start answering my questions."
This time she challenged his stare.
He wasn't her Alpha, so she didn't have to bow and show respect, but nonetheless, there must have been a pretty monumental struggle going on inside.

"You have no idea.
And then Kowalski made some comments to Big Mac, and they got into it, and Sarge ended up making us all do extra laps."
Big Mac was one of the African-American guys in the company and I could just imagine what Kowalski might say to him.
I shook my head in disbelief.
"That son of a bitch."
"Well, beware, Kowalski is going to be a real bitch when he gets back here.
Not only did Mac flatten him in their little tussle, but Sarge made K stay behind and do push-ups."
I laughed.
Mac was called Big Mac for a reason and Kowalski should have known better than to pick on him.
Served him right whatever punishment he got.
"How many push-ups?"
Meyer looked over at me with a grin.
"Sarge just told him to go and he'd tell him when to stop."
I chuckled.
Sarge push-ups were brutal.
He'd once assigned a private push-ups "until he said to stop," and then sat down and ate his dinner and read the newspaper for two hours all while the soldier did his push-ups.
When Sarge finally released him, he couldn't even move, his buddies had to come and drag him back to the barracks.
Kowalski came in just a few minutes later though, looking thoroughly pissed off and covered in mud.
One of the other guys, Henderson, was the first to say something to him.
"Whoa, Kowalski, you look like Sarge made you eat dirt ... literally."
