In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Secrecy_status', 'tfidf': 3.0868463872326575, 'lexical_unit': 'clandestine.a / surreptitious.a / covert.a / secret.a / secretly.adv / open.a / public.a / confidential.a / publicly.adv / concealed.a / unclassified.a / shadowy.a', 'definition': "A Phenomenon, which may be an activity, state or object, is purposefully hidden from the awareness of a potential Cognizer.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

There's a cougar that's been wandering around this area.
Just thought I should warn you, you know, do my neighborly duty and all."
The man's face hardened and Troy's beast responded in kind.
Was he afraid?
Had Troy truly scared him the night before?
"It's a forest."
His mate's voice matched the look on his face.
"Of course there are mountain lions wandering around.
I'm sure he means no harm, so just leave him alone."
What was this?
His mate was defending his cougar?
Troy's shock must have shown on his face because the amazing man standing in front of him raised his chin just a little.
He must have mistaken Troy's pride at being defended by his mate for something else, because his stance said "So what are you gonna do about it".
"You may be right...
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name."
Troy needed something from his mate in that moment.
A name, a touch, anything.
"It's Seth."
His shoulders relaxed and that made Troy's tension ease as well.
"Nice to meet you."

That part made sense to her, "By what authority would my father speak if the common perception were to become that anyone can take the law into their own hands whenever they choose?
After you established beyond all doubt that the king alone has authority to punish, you lent that association to him by leaving some justice to his judgment.
By handing off Amber to my father, you made him seem kingly in his own right and thus elevated him in the esteem of all.
I took no offense, if that's what concerns you."
Jim offered a rare smile, "I'm glad you see the larger picture.
I didn't want you to think I was trying to diminish your father."
Jessica told him, "You were wise to chastise Carmen, even if it had to be on her wedding day.
In Denver, while the rest of us ran for our lives, I saw her stand alone against a hunter while carrying a sword of all things.
She's even an expert pilot.
Carmen is the most skilled soldier I've ever seen and all of us owe her much for coming with you to rescue us, but sometimes she frightens me.
I saw her face when she was going to burn Senator Floxman in the oil fryer.
How could anything but insanity make her strong enough to pick up a man like that?"
Jim was not prepared to delve into the matter of androids, "I had no choice but to rein in Carmen before she made a habit of thinking she's the sheriff.
You're right that she's more than dangerous and unpredictable besides.
I needed to do it even though it still cost me with Critias.
He has no forgiveness over any slight to her or to his own pride.
If I could have only taken one of them to protect me in Denver, I would have chosen Critias over Carmen."
"I don't think it cost you anything," Jessica disagreed with certitude.
"All you did was to give her the adjustment she needed, a goal he has been struggling with himself.
Even though he didn't suffer any punishment on their behalf, his public display of willingness to do so earned him the same valor.
