'' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .'

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Of course the doctor knew of Robertson's reputation and did his best to talk the man down, but it was to no effect.
Big Bill kept his wife at home and delivered his son himself (under the eye of a midwife) to spite the sonofabitch.
And the boy turned out fine, the spitting image of his old man with just a paintbrush sketch of his mother behind the lines.
The townsfolk wrung their hands in envy and wiped their brows contemplating his good fortune.
Some estimated Big Bill's wealth at 100 million, some at 200.
In actuality, it was just shy of 30 million, but with the median salary at the time around $15,000 a year it didn't really make a helluva lot of difference.
In the mix was also over a quarter million acres of land both in Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky.
The old man's list of friends read like a Republican fund raiser list.
The boy would have been able to do anything in the world.
Absolutely anything at all.
It just so happened he wanted to be a deputy sheriff.
Perhaps if Big Bill had lived a little longer things would have been different for his only son.
Maybe he would've been able to talk his boy into something less dangerous, more prestigious maybe.
After all, here was a young man with unlimited resources.
Why not investments like his old man or even a construction company?
Little Will told Big Bill several times he intended on becoming a sheriff, but of course the old man laughed it off, said it was 'kid's stuff'.
After all, every boy wanted to be a cop or fireman, didn't they? he'd laugh, pounding one of his friends on the back.
That's what kept the toy manufacturers cranking out all those rescue vehicles, ladder trucks, paddy wagons.
Most of them grew out of it by the time they got to high school.
And so Big Bill died believing his son's wish was no more than a whim of childhood.

"Gender-queer," she rolled her eyes.
"I don't subscribe to conventional, binary gender distinctions," she said in a nasally voice.
"Instead of she, you can refer to me as snoogle-dee."
"Snoogle-dee?"
Alfonso couldn't believe what he was hearing.
"Yes.
That's my preferred pronoun."
"I've never heard of that."
"That's because I just made it up."
"When?"
asked Mike.
"Just now," she smiled as if she had accomplished something.
"Got it," Alfonso nodded his head.
"Anyway, how do you go about improving students' critical thinking skills?"
"We indoctrinate them into social Marxist ideology."
"I'm not sure how critical thinking and indoctrination go together," Mike noted.
"Well, we don't indoctrinate exactly.
You see we're pretty clever, we present both conservative information and social Marxist doctrine so students think they are seeing both sides of the argument.
But we present the information in a slanted way and ask leading questions to make students think they are coming to pro social Marxist opinions on their own!"
She laughed with excitement.
