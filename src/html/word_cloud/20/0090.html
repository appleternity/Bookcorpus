        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

She was all too delighted to comply.
She swooped in a circle, doubling back along the road, seeing the fighters below with her finely-tuned dragon senses.
She ducked her head beneath the tree canopy and let out a blast of steam, then delivered more of the same to the approaching men.
From the heat I felt at her side, she wasn't holding much back.
It wasn't enough to kill them, but they would be fools to stay put and risk another dose.
My arm shook as I fought to keep my grip.
I should climb higher and get a better position on Axen's back, but I couldn't coax my muscles into movement.
Darkness and light fought an impressive battle at the corners of my vision.
You didn't hurt anyone from Emsha, did you?
They're all fighting so close.
I avoided them, but some might be a little red.
I exhaled.
Are they done?
She tilted her wings and retraced her path, ducking her head below the canopy once more.
A couple of high branches tore at my legs, nearly unseating my grip.
She snuffed without any steam as she lifted her head, her thoughts filled with glee.
They are now.
The last ones saw me, wet themselves, and ran. Go.
I was too exhausted to say anything further.
Back to the village.

Olsen heard the command but had already made up his mind.
He fired several more shots, but only some of them found their targets.
The shots gave him time, and he turned away from the Royal party and sprinted straight towards the Toyota truck.
Deane's voice, for the first time full of emotion, came over the radio.
'Sam!
Stay where you are.
Repeat!
Do not deviate from your position!'
Olsen remembered the image of the smug looking men walking away from the car, and he was now convinced the attack was all part of a greater plan.
Upon reaching the truck, he crouched down and used it as cover.
He fired from his gun again and took down the remaining attackers on his side.
Occasional bullets caused sparks to fly as they hit the truck but Olsen had given himself time to take a gamble.
He ducked instinctively as another shot came too close for comfort, flipped open his Samsung Galaxy S3 mobile phone and quickly tapped several keys.
Menu screens flashed past at lightning speed on the display.
Olsen set the phone to scramble any incoming signals and placed it on the driver's seat as he ducked again, this time choosing to return fire before inspecting the contents of the vehicle.
With the phone in place, Olsen knew it would interfere with any signals sent to the area if there was an incendiary device in play.
Jozef turned around to his brother and shouted at full voice as another two of his men perished under fire.
'Try it again!'
The truck refused to detonate, and Jozef rushed over and took the activator.
He pressed the appropriate buttons, but the display informed him of an error.
