        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

Would he see the girl in the deerskin dress?
Would she be sitting beside the pool?
Then he remembered he didn't have a lantern.
His shoulders slumped.
The boardwalk ended, and he stood before the dark entrance.
Cold air blew from the opening, beckoning him inside.
He took another step forward.
Glancing back he saw heat waves rising from the boardwalk.
They distorted the image of the trees and made the ground shimmer like a pool.
He turned back to the cool cave.
Just a few steps inside.
Not far enough to get lost in the darkness.
He let his fingers trail along the cave wall.
His eyes began to adjust, and it didn't seem so dark.
There was a soft glow ahead.
He blinked several times and rubbed his eyes.
A shaft of light lit up the center of the main chamber.
He had forgotten about the hole in the roof.
He hurried forward, but stopped at the edge of the pool of light.
Someone was sitting there.

"My memory for the users of this device is linked with the activation location memory slot.
Therefore, I will not be able to recognize your use of this device beyond one trip," she said.
"But, based on your last request, I can modify this to my program, which can be recoverable to the default script at any time."
"Works for me," Greg said.
"Shall I continue with the interrupted placement of the previous request?"
"I am ready," Greg said.
"You will be placed in five seconds..."
The walk back to his truck did not take long.
Greg's heart lightened when he recognize he'd returned to the correct exit.
After all, he'd impulsively pulled off of the freeway.
His truck sat where he had left it, no sign of his past self, confirming that his dash clock read the proper time.
The windows were down and the door creaked as he got in, as if he had been gone a million years.
The unguarded painting and rucksack full of money were still untouched.
Greg started his truck, and at that moment, the greatest love of his life swept over him.
Though he had only known her a short time, but he loved his truck more than any person on earth.
The love was real; she was under him and all around him.
His love for the machine surpassed the love he felt for his mother, the flashes of memory he still had of his father, and his long gone brother.
His family was just facts in his life, but the steering wheel in his hand and the door beside him were real.
With these feeling full inside him, he swore to himself he would keep that truck for the rest of his life.
Seeing his younger self, walking down the street pulling his old red wagon had been a strange experience for Greg.
