This frame is used for LUs that do not belong in daughter frames, either because they are too general to have any particular image schema associated with them (e.g., here.adv), or because we do not (yet) have a specific frame with the correct image schema (e.g., inland.a).  Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).  In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:  'This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.'  There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.  In some very specific situations, prepositions, adjectives, and nouns can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:  'Inside my wallet is where I put it .'

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"Hey stranger hop in."
She smiled looking at me over the rim of her glasses.
"I'm sorry I haven't been around too much lately Janet."
I frowned looking at her.
"One of us had to bring up my absence eventually."
"It's okay, I completely understand."
She said happily.
"Wow I had expected you to yell at me, call me a bitch or something."
I joked.
She smiled at first but quickly her expression changed into pure sickness, she swerved away from the road and parked the car quickly jumping out and throwing up all over the place.
I swear I jumped all the way from my side of the car to hers in one leap quickly pulling back her hair so the vomit didn't get in it.
"What the heck is going on?"
I asked as she finished.
"Food poisoning."
She said after a minute.
"I took a chance and got some take out from that place on forth street again."
"Are you losing your mind?"
I asked feeling bad about her being sick.
"Yeah I think that I am."
She said beginning to sob a little bit as she held her stomach.

"God."
Daniel's voice was a whisper against his hair.
"God.
Holy God.
I was so damned scared.
I've been in action before.
Hell, I was at Pearl.
And I was never as scared as I was tonight, not knowing where you were or if you were safe."
"Me too.
I was listening to the PA.
You had to have been right in the middle of it."
"Near enough."
Daniel loosened his grip enough for Jacob to draw a shaky breath.
"Now what?"
Jacob couldn't resist sliding his cheek against Daniel's neck.
"I want to kiss you again."
"Okay."
Daniel cupped his face between warm calloused palms.
His skin smelled like smoke and fireworks.
Jacob thought from now on he would always love that smell.
