This Frame has unique Frame-to-Frame Relations: it inherits from and uses the Eventive_cognizer_affecting frame. This is atypical of FrameNet's frame relations.

There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"No."
"Well, I do."
Her voice was hard.
"Something's...changed."
"What do you mean?"
Her voice rattled as she tore at the grass.
"Strange things have been happening."
"You mean besides me?"
She nodded.
"Like what?"
She looked into my eyes.
"Like I've been seeing things.
Out of order.
Like I'm seeing them before they happen."
She shook her head.
"I don't know how to explain it."
"Maybe it's nothing," I offered.
"Maybe," she breathed.
I didn't like that look on her face, shadows replacing her blushed cheeks and starlit eyes.
My fingers crawled across the grass, curling around her thumb.

Rebecca felt her nod.
"Something wrong?"
David wondered.
"Could you not slam the door shut?"
Rebecca would've put a little more emphasis on each of those words if Mae was in the next room.
"I...
I didn't mean to."
He removed his gloves feeling the gravity of what he'd done.
"I'm sorry, Mae.
I often forget what used to happen when you got in trouble.
Well, it's more like I choose not to remember.
We haven't harmed you in... what is it, four years now?
Doesn't that convince you that we're not like them?"
"What did I tell you about bringing that up?"
Rebecca said reproachfully.
"I'm not!"
He exhaled.
"Babe, I'm just trying to make a point."
"Don't call her that," Mae said sternly.
"Never again call her that."
