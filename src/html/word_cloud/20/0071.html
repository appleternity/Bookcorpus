Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"And what sort of power do you feel you hold over me?"
"I hold every card.
Heaven and Hell.
Damnation and heresy."
"But I was duly elected pope."
"And I suppose they can kick your can out of the Vatican once they find you and I were in cahoots."
Justin laughed.
"I've been to London and I've been to Paris, but I've never been to cahoots.
Is it tropical?"
"I'll tropical your bum."
Justin grinned like a chessy cat, reached in a desk drawer, withdrew an evil looking pistol and pointed it at Hilda.
Startled, she pulled back, her eyes widened.
Then she regained her composure.
She was quite an operator.
"You won't shoot me here in this office."
"Really, Hilda, why not?
What better place for the Pope to shoot someone?
I can have your body wrapped and carried out to the Vatican crematorium.
By sundown you'd be a pile of ashes tossed into the Tiber.
I'm certain you're not in a state of grace.

In fact, she mostly didn't talk to him at all.
'Hm?' he answered uncertainly.
'Did you say that before you turned tail you worked in the SFFHC?' 'Sure.' 'Tell me, what are the humans like?'
Grunt tried to remember something about ordinary humans.
Then, a memory came to his mind.
It was one about a woman who accidentally swapped anticonceptives with antidepressants, now she had ten children and she didn't care.
'Confused,' he answered.
'No, I mean,' she continued doubtfully, 'I mean things like, how many tentacles they have.'
If Grunt had had any eyes the scales would have fallen from them.
Instead, he just gazed at her with a blank screen.
'What's the problem?' she asked innocently.
She'd certainly be going red in the face if she had one.
Grunt took a deep breath through his cooling system: 'Tentacles?' 'Sure, tentacles.
You're acting as though humans didn't have tentacles.' 'But Grunt, humans don't have tentacles.'
A silence fell, interrupted only by distant voices made by the machines' efforts to convert the Earth's core into a multi-functional fusion reactor.
'Grunt, haven't you seen the movies showing what your lethal enemy looks like?
Didn't they show you what they want you to kill?' 'I never liked documentaries much.'
Grunt's screen went blank again.
'But this wasn't voluntary.
They broadcast it to everyone.' 'I considered that to be filthy propaganda so I didn't watch.' 'You considered that propaganda?
