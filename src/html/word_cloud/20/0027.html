This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Similarly, most inheriting frames profile only the Affected entity, not the full Effect situation which is often incorporated into the frame or the particular target.  So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).  'He made me angry.'

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}];

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

You can usually find a carpool from where you are to where you're going, but you come home.
I might move up here, Talon Peak or one of the other smaller towns, but not 'away.'
The people on the other side of the mountains feel the same way about that area.
More move to the other side than out."
"The mountains are 'narrow' through here.
The geology of this southeast spur is interesting, which is why the mountains are somewhat hollow."
"Yes, Knight, but they're still there.
If that ore hadn't been so rich they went after it first, they wouldn't be.
The colonial charter 'expired' a half-century ago."
"You've heard it too.
The government is not of the people."
"It committed great offense against the life of this world.
I looked.
It's true."
"I was a little nervous about looking."
"Around here, lots do, then go out in the forest and look for scrumptious.
That mountainside will be a picnic just waiting for a cloth in thirty days.
No one farms it because it's parkland.
What did I say?"
"Nev said... insurance rates wouldn't be high for year-round use and a ski lift could go right beside the clubhouse."

I don't know if I will see my adoptive parents again, or if I will take any of their calls, reply to any of their emails.
I need time to understand, and I left behind a note saying so.
It's time for me to understand what you never told me - Iris I told Joshua I'll be fine, but now that I am alone on this plane I know the lie is bigger than I thought it would be when I said it.
I'm leaving all I have behind to look for a sister who might be dead.
Who might be somewhere where I'll never find her.
I have objective reasons to feel lonely, and being as physically drained as I am just makes the emotional chaos worse.
Sleep, Iris, sleep.
My eyes closed, I try to sleep.
But I can't, because I have the feeling that a guy is observing me.
I noticed him when I was lining up at the gate, his eyes somehow constantly brushing on me.
His gaze was not blunt enough for me to stand up and say, "hey stop it", it was rather the more subtle sideways type of gaze you can't argue against.
This man is the type you hope won't be sitting close to you, because if he does you'll never be able to push him away.
At first it seems like our seats are not close, but then he somehow manages to find his way to a spot not too far from where I'm sitting.
I wonder what he told the hostess to convince her to let him take a seat so bloody close to me.
As I sit with my eyes closed, I can't see the guy's eyes but I bet they're still slyly landscaping me.
Perhaps I'm being paranoid.
I sense that exhaustion is taking over...
"I thought you wouldn't come anymore", says Stephanie "How late am I?"
"About a month, but don't worry, we all know that last minutes accidents happen", she says and laughs "I can't believe the flight took so long.
I'm sorry..."
