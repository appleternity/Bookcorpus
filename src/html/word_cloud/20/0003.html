'' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .'

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet. 
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

                        <pre>
There was to be a Temperance Meeting that evening in the Wesleyan Schoolroom, so Marjorie hurried away from Miss Macnab's tea table to take part in it.
The room was crowded, many working men and women filling up the seats.
First there were two short speeches, then Miss Louisa Marsh sang a Temperance song, then more speeches and stories, and then a song from Marjorie Mowbray.
This latter took the fancy of the women folk particularly, it was so sweet, so moving; and they urged their husbands and brothers to try and get her to sing again.
When Marjorie heard the clapping and the stamping and the calls for just another song, she wondered what she could sing them, for she had not brought the music of a second song with her.
"Do give them something else, Miss Marjorie," whispered John Weston.
"I believe not one of them will go to a whisky shop tonight."
Mr. Absalom Marsh had been bringing out a second set of papers on Joseph Addison in Cleanliness, and at the end of the last of the papers he had given a hymn written by that great man, as a proof of his godliness.
Marjorie had always liked that special hymn, and she had composed a tuneful chant to it for her own private singing.
This, she now resolved to let the audience hear.
Most of the men and women present read Cleanliness, so they would be familiar with the words.
She seated herself at the piano, facing the impatient audience, and sang "The Spacious Firmament on High," her splendid, well trained contralto voice echoing solemnly through the long room.
When she had finished, the applause was great.
"Why, 'tis the hymn as Master put in the paper this very week.
Paper says 'twas written by a great man as lived more'n a hundred years agone," said one of the men; while the women cried over Marjorie's grand, solemn voice, and felt awed and subdued in spite of themselves.
"If the hand as made us is divine, we'll let the beer shop be tonight," muttered some of the elder men.
"It would be a downright shame to go a-brawlin' and a -singin' artcr that 'ere grand thing."
So most of the audience went quietly and soberly past the public houses that night, and the solemn, beautiful voice of the singer, and the "sensible, splendid, reasonable words of that 'ere song," rang for many a day in the ears of the Market Hawley folk.

But there will be those who will try--" "And I'll break their arms," Mosin growled.
"You will not," Satherlin shot back.
"You have to allow Sylenn to do this on her own, Mosin.
If you constantly protect her, you'll render her incapable of defending herself when you aren't around.
Understood?"
Mosin grumbled something passingly resembling an agreement.
Satherlin continued.
"There will be those who will try various things, and you must remember that you are a great deal stronger than they are.
We're trying to protect Alluvia, not thin out the population."
"Much as we occasionally would like to," Clatyn added sardonically, rapidly emptying the platter in front of him.
"But ... physical relations ... just aren't possible in out suited forms, so you don't have to worry about that.
Just be careful when and where you unsuit.
If you can, wait until you get back here.
Now, let's have you practice some blocks and punches.
Clatyn is our Arms expert, such as we have.
The Ancients didn't leave us many actual weapons, and human weapons don't work on the Sukkers themselves.
But Clat will be able to teach you basic combat and can evaluate what training you need still.
Don't worry about getting a stomach cramp; you'll find that it's actually easier to eat a big meal before suiting up for battle; you'll have strength longer.
Mosin, over there; now."
Fulenthen was not a natural fighter, but neither was she hopeless.
