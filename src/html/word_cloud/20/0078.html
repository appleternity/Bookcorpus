In addition, some LUs assert a direction in which to find the Figure from the Ground (e.g. atop).  \'There was a tight-fitting lid on the bottle .\' \'Against the back wall stood a young black man staring at his shoes .\' \'Against the back wall three students were reading .\' \'Clean if the jewelery is ever in contact with water or chlorine .\'  This frame participates in productive metaphor cases, like "shining a light on corruption", "Stalin\'s hand lay heavy on the presses", "it touched her heart" in each of which an abstract entity affects another entity as if they were in physical contact. \'\'  This frame is intended to cover the description of writing, images, or situations being depicted on a document, canvas, screen, or other flat surface, including metaphorical cases where there is no literal document, like "on record" or "pretty low on my list". \'They were arguing on screen .\' \'Watching chess is pretty low on my list .\'  The use of on.prep to describe use of a vehicle is not included in this frame even though it does involve contact and support.

Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.

"Which makes her want him that much more," Billie added.
"It's sort of like watching Karma in action."
I had to laugh with them over that.
If my first impression of Ashley was correct, she and I were in different leagues.
It was nice to have proof that someone like her could strike out too, like it balanced the universe or something.
Maybe Billie was right and it was Karma.
There was more idle chatter about celebrities and clothes, and then Ally let out a dramatic sigh.
"So are we doing this or not?"
"Might as well get started," Billie agreed.
I didn't really care about the seance, but I wanted to hold onto this rare moment of female bonding so I agreed.
"So what all do we need?"
I asked Billie looked puzzled, "Haven't you ever done one of these before?"
"Not really," I confessed.
Ally clapped her hands together like a little girl, almost bouncing on the bed.
"Oh, this will be fun."
I brought the candles they requested and hoped the spirits didn't mind the scent of vanilla bean.
As commanded, I joined the circle the two of them had started on the floor.
"Now only one person should talk at a time," Billie explained.
"We don't want to confuse the spirits."
Playing along, I nodded.

I know you're not buying something like that for yourself."
Myrtle filled her in quickly.
Elaine said, "I was wondering how everything was going with the case.

"Silas would suspect something if I brought one of those over, and said I thought it belonged to Annette.
My pocketbooks are roomy, comfortable, and perfect for me--and they wouldn't work at all for somebody like Annette.
Plus," said Myrtle with a sigh, "they look like old lady purses."
"Nothing wrong with that!"
said Elaine emphatically.
Then she added, "What are you hoping to find out from Silas when you see him?"
"Well, it would be lovely if he just gave up and told me that he was responsible for killing two people.
Somehow, though, I'm thinking that probably won't happen.
I'd love to find out if he has an alibi for the murders.
And I'd also like to hear him unload about Charles Clayborne--maybe give me some more insight into the guy."
"I thought that Miles was Charles Clayborne's cousin," said Elaine with a frown.
"Wasn't he able to fill you in about him?"
"Not particularly," said Myrtle dryly.
