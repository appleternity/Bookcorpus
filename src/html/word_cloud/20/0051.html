NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

"I agree with you but can we stay here for a while just the two of us.
I've missed you so much, and you only have two days.
We haven't seen each other in months, and I don't want to share you with anyone right now."
"Lana I want to say yes everything in me wants me to say yes but the last time I saw you, you were in love with Dominick and telling me that the feelings you had for me weren't real.
You told me you slept with him.
That hurt me.
I can't explain to you how bad I hurt for a long time.
I can't go through that again."
"I know I hurt you.
I know it hurt you to find out that I had slept with Dominick.
I wish I could take it all back.
I would if I could, but I can't all I can say is I was mixed up.
I'm not asking you to take me back or for things to return to the way they used to be.
I don't want that either.
I've changed.
Case I'm a different person."
He doesn't say anything but he never moved either.
Taking a chance I crawl over him straddling his legs and lift his head.
When his eyes meet mine, I see the hurt, I caused him.
"I swear to you I will never hurt you again.

Instead, a declaration of a state emergency was announced.
The TV media came under state control and announcements were made about how they, this cohort of patriotic men, led by Tony Garside, were going to clean up the country.
Tony Garside, the recognised leader of the group, sat in front of the TV camera and read his cue cards perfectly, with supreme confidence and authority.
"I have today taken charge of State affairs following the sad but necessary departure of our previous government.
My colleagues and I, promise the people of this country that corruption will be rooted out and those responsible will be punished.
Criminals will be caught and locked away.
We will build sufficient prisons to ensure that happens.
After full and lengthy discussions with the police and the military, we will utilise open ground such as sports fields and parks to build containment pens.
These will be used for any persons who embark upon anti-social behaviour and they will be removed from your streets.
There will be zero tolerance.
A draft constitution is being developed that will re-establish the values and principles I know you all wish to see as part of our society once again.
My cabinet colleagues and I have the full support of the military and the police to make it happen.
I will make a further announcement in due course.
Goodnight and God bless you all."
When he was sure that he was off camera, Tony Garside leaned back in the chair.
He smoothed his well-groomed dark hair, loosened his tie and smiled, not smugly but with a satisfied smile knowing he had delivered his speech just as he planned and he had arrived.
The TV commentator announced, 'That was a broadcast on behalf of the Interim Government.
Ordinary people interviewed by the television company (now suddenly called State TV), generally welcomed what they heard.
At last, something was going to be done about crime, about hooliganism and corruption.
There was a sense of relief.
