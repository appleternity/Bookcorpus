        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet. 
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the correct one.</span>

"I've told her all along, she's a free agent.
Actually, I'm really glad she's finally found someone else who can take care of her.
And handle her needs."
There was a note in his voice that Pierson immediately picked up on.
The background music finally came into focus, singing, "Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?
Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening me."
He gazed at Mike with sudden suspicion.
"What's going on, Mike?"
"Later.
So what's in the briefcase?"
Accepting the change of subject, Pierson put the case on the desk.
"A little bit of paperwork to finish off," he said, opening and removing a sheaf of papers.
"The finding approved you and the Tigers for recovering two dozen weapons, twenty-two at ten per, and the others at twenty per, for a total of two hundred sixty million."
"Damn."
"They wouldn't authorize payment on the twenty-fifth, though, on the grounds that --" 	"Oh, I'm not arguing that point.
Figured that, in the end, it was enlightened self-interest as much as anything else.
Still.
That's a lot of scratch, Bob.
Do my bank accounts good, after the dent the girls put in it."
"It is.

"I don't remember you...either of you."
Carr had accepted that he was never going to see his sister again.
But now that he had and she didn't remember him, it became too much.
The calm, composed boy was gone and Carr began to cry, leaning into Kael's side for support.
"Yes, we know each other," Kael murmured, his arm snaking around Carr's shoulders in comfort.
"This is your home and this is your brother," he explained.
The shock and fear had left her emerald eyes.
Now they were locked with Kael's as she searched for an answer to an unspoken question.
Trust.
She found it in his open and unguarded expression.
Prea had always trusted her instincts.
"All right," she responded finally.
"You're the first people I've come across that know me.
Or claim they know me.
That's good enough for me," she concluded.
"So this is my home?"
"Yes.
Your family home is just up the road at the top of the cliff," Kael answered, pointing over his shoulder.
Carr's tears started to dry up once his sister had accepted what they told her.
"Come on!"
