Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

Tapping the side of the archway made it a lot safer; they weren't worried about cutting off someone's heel!
Everything didn't seem as strange this time.
In Northcity they glimpsed a large square but as it was early, before dawn, there was nothing happening.
The next archway took them to Northcentral.
It was mid-morning and the square outside the building entrances was busy with people moving about.
Many merchants were set up under sun shades, trading their goods.
Paul noticed one of the guards being curious about them, so they couldn't linger.
They moved quickly to the archway that would take them to Great Island Two.
On arriving on Great Island Two, Amy saw that both side walls as well as the front were open to a beach area.
The sun was shining in a clear blue sky, and a gentle breeze would keep them cool.
With palm trees and white sand it was...
"Perfect!"
Amy sighed.
"We have two extra hours," suggested Frank.
Paul was more cautious, "Agreed, but test the iron gold code first."
Amy changed the metal beads in Simon's staff to the code.
She pushed it into the wall, and it disappeared.
"It's OK."
Paul wasn't satisfied.
"We don't know if it's outgoing only, or if it goes to the yellow dome."

Dona Chamita nodded.
"He says that he's always considered you to be the most beautiful woman in the world and thought it funny for you to be insecure about your looks.
He never thought you'd take his porker comments seriously.
He's so sorry."
"Sometimes men can be pretty clueless," Ymelda grumbled.
"Sorry, Roy, but it's the truth."
"Roy says he knows how insensitive he could be at times," Dona Chamita conveyed.
"He's really sorry.
That porker comment was completely out of line."
Iris smiled brightly, shiny tears in her eyes.
"I'm so happy he realizes how much he hurt me calling me a porker."
"He's so sorry," Ymelda asserted.
"Very, very sorry."
Iris smiled.
"I accept his apology."
"He's relieved," stated Ymelda.
Iris sighed.
"If he forgave me for the infidelity, forgiving him for his unfiltered mouth is a no brainer."
"He wants you to move on with your life, dear-one," Dona Chamita added.
"He's seen how stuck you've been and wants the best for you and his son."
