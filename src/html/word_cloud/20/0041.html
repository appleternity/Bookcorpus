The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

They said they never heard of the bum.
I was starting to smell a rat, a two legged one, like this dame wasn't exactly on the up and up."
"How come you didn't just give up the case Dirk?"
Bone asked, so I had to clue him in.
"She had already paid me in advance.
Besides I wanted to find out why this dame was giving me the run around.
Also, did I mention she was quite beautiful?"
"Oh, all right, gotcha Dirk."
"Anyway, so I gave a friend of mine who was a member of the L.A. cop shop a jingle.
He owed me a favorite from back in the days.
Just so happen I had a glass in my possession with a perfect set of her finger prints.
I forgot to mention, I gave her a glass of water, that's how I got her prints, you see.
Hopefully she was on file and I could find out who she was.
As luck would have it, she was.
You won't believe who she turned out to be.
Go on and guess Bone."
"I don't know, Dirk.
You telling the story.
"Her real name was Maria Demucci, an ex-stripper and wife to a notorious mob hit man by the name of Vinnie "the pick" Demucci.
He got his nick name from his choice of murder weapon.

If to no one else, you owe it to them to end your father's reign of horror."
"I don't even know who I am."
Randall's voice was vacuous, ethereal.
"You are royalty.
Act like it."
Was Kron right?
Randall had been in hiding for three years.
He was tired of it, but he had found some kind of life in Bond.
Now that was shattered.
He couldn't go back to being a healer, at least not in this city.
He would have to move on, find another place to hide.
Perhaps in a few years he could send a note to Maslin to tell him he was safe, but until then he would have to cut all ties with Bond and West Ursia.
It would mean a life of hiding again, a life on the road searching for something never to be found.
Verkain would always be after him, especially now that his father had been so close to capturing him.
Randall knew it was only a matter of time before he was caught, returned to Kobalos and slain.
Was he running for nothing?
Was delaying the inevitable only bringing more pain and death to others?
For the first time in a long time, Randall felt as if he was back in Kobalos, wrapped in iron chains within his father's dungeon.
Death was inevitable.
The healer stood.
