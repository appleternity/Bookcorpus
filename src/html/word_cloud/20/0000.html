Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet. 
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

His mouth turned up slightly at the corners.
"Are you really."

Meanwhile, in the city center...
The Blade was pulsating with the loud, insidious dance beat.
The music didn't drown out the low, persistent buzzing of voices in the air.
Razor City's underworld was talking.
Petra didn't need to listen.
She knew what they were talking about.
Or rather, whom they were talking about.
Prince Dante.
She glanced around the club.
There were more than the usual small groups of outlaws, rebels, bounty hunters and masked dancers.
None of the King's Marshals had dared enter, but there were nobles sitting alone or in groups of two or three.
It seemed as though the bounty hunters, too, had come out in droves.
They scattered around the room, eyeing the patrons intensely.
They all wanted to be the one to find the prince.
If there was a price on him, it was steep.
A huge, scarred man in a long, black duster and a battered old cowboy hat sat at the bar, sipping on a drink that looked too small for his enormous hands.
There were two huge guns strapped in leather holsters on his hips.

She shook her head sadly.
"And I am bloody keeping them."
"We are bloody keeping them."
He said gently.
Without answering she picked up the remote control and switched on the television, conversation at an end.
After the first bad day the induction had gone quite well and they were not left hanging around again.
There had been one dodgy moment when Paul had finally discovered that the MGB belonged to Tony and had made a few comments about the unsuitability of the car for lugging scruffy and often unwashed teenagers around the county, but by then he and Tony were getting on quite well so it didn't last long.
Tony pointed out that the car was twelve years old however good it looked and then took him for a troll around the City Centre with the roof right back and they did a bit of posing in front of the lunch time crowds of office girls.
Paul maintained that the only reason Tony had the car was because from a driving position, where his backside was only a few inches above the road, he could see up most of the miniskirts they passed.
Tony conceded it was part of the attraction.
On the last Friday afternoon of induction they had gone to visit the Probation Service offices for Central Bristol.
The fact that Sue Mandelow accompanied them for the first time in the fortnight gave them some idea of the importance placed on this visit.
At Careers and Social Services they had just been given a contact name and left to fend for them selves.
The Probation Service for this area was housed in an old, detached Victorian house, the only one on a tree-lined avenue that had not been converted to flats and bed sits.
The original large hallway had been boxed in to form a small office and reception area and a plump and pleasant soul in her mid fifties greeted them.
"Hello, Sue.
Rupert is expecting you.
Go straight up to the common room and I will let him know you are here."
They trailed up the stairs behind Sue and along a short corridor full of doors with names on them and finally into what had at once been the front master bedroom.
This was full of easy chairs, about half of which were occupied by fairly well dressed people drinking tea and eating biscuits.
