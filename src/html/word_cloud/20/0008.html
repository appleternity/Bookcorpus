        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

By the way, my name's Gloria.
Geeze, I can't believe it, Barry Thomson in person.'
The conversation was overheard by the group of young cops and they broke away to join Barry and (senior) Constable Meadows.
They all wanted to shake Barry's hand and compliment him.
Seems that while they supported different teams they as one, respected his on-field skills.
There was a lot of laughter and friendly jibes thrown around; Constable Meadows it seems was accepted as 'one of the boys'.
Barry was in the middle of retelling the tale of the drawn Grand Final against Collingwood when,  'WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
This is a police station unless you haven't noticed.
I could hear the racket out back.
Someone better explain - now!'
Barry paused and turned round to face the direction of the menacing voice.
All conversation had died.
Then before he could do anything further the voice continued,  "Aha, Barry Thomson.
How are you Barry?
Heard you were coming to our town ... remember me?'
Now Barry came face to face with the voice and gulped ...
Laurie Cree.
It was Laurie Cree, a lot older but still the same and - Sergeant Laurie Cree no less!
Into the stony silence that had gripped everybody Barry managed, 'Laurie ...
Laurie Cree.

'Stephen Rochester,' he said, shaking Mornay's hand.
'Jacques Mornay, our new Director of Security,' Robert introduced Mornay.
'Timely,' Ramsay said, smiling at Jacques Mornay.
'I'm an old friend of Robert's.
I'm a freelance journalist.
Robert and I worked together back in London.
And I think I might have some information about this Henry Higgins' article that you people are interested in.'
The eel's cold eyes suddenly showed interest.
'We are very interested, Mr Rochester,' Mornay said.
Ramsay nodded.
'But I do need to do some more digging, you understand, before I'm certain of my facts.
I mean we don't want to transgress the libel laws, do we?' 'I suppose not,' Mornay said.
Ramsay looked at his watch.
'I'm sorry,' he said to all of them.
'But I will have to leave now.
I have a train to catch.
But I will keep in touch, Robert.'
He glanced at Mornay.
'I owe Robert a favour, Mr ....
Mornay.
