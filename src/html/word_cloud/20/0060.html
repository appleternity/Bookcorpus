Some members of this frame indicate the plexity of the Ground, as either single-entity gestalt (inside), two-entity or bi-partite gestalt (between.prep), and multiple-entity or multipart gestalt (among.prep, amid.prep), while others are maximally general (in.prep).   \'\'  This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary.  In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion ("in a box"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change ("in the garden").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  \'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .\' \'My keys were in the street .\' \'Step back outside . CNI DNI \' \'She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .\' \'I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI\' \'They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI\' \'Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .\' \'We talked outside the office .\' \'\'  This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event.  (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) \'The pole snapped off in her hand .\' \'She combed her hair between her fingers .\' \'\'  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: \'Inside my wallet is where i put it .\' \'Outside your blind date\'s door seems like the worst place in the world .\' \'\'  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: \'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  \'Is the economy in recession ?\' \'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI \' \'\'  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer\'s mind (construed as a Ground): \'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI\' \'I felt an unease inside me .\' \'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .\' \'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .\' \'\'  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): \'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .\' \'There are so many children in the family .\' \'\'  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: \'amid the confusion\' \'inside the competition period\' \'between lunch and dinner\' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word "period") while others can take events as Grounds directly. \'\'  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): \'In the paper , `` self-control \'\' is used to mean a sense of willpower .\' \'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .\' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. \'\' \'\'  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Amanda didn't know if she was insisting to be carried, because she knew someone would, or if her leg really did hurt.
Jeremy was not happy about having to go to the doctor and took off running, when he was told of the plans.
Craig let him run, but when he could see the boy was running too far and getting close to the field with a large bull in it, he went after him on a horse.
Eventually, they were all in the wagon on their way to town.
Craig gave Jeremy a good talking to about running away and how dangerous that was on a farm, where he was not familiar with places and animals he needed to avoid.
Amanda held Grace close to her, as she whimpered all the way into town, responding to the tension from her brother.
When they finally arrived in front of the doctor's office, Craig jumped down from the wagon and went inside to make sure the doctor was there and willing to see them.
He came back out with the doctor's wife, Mrs. Pamela Collins.
"Why don't you and Grace come inside, while the doctor spends time with Jeremy," Mrs. Collins suggested to Amanda.
She thought it was a good idea.
After Craig helped her down from the wagon and placed Grace into her arms, she followed Pamela into her home.
"Would you like some milk and cookies?"
Mrs. Collins asked Grace, who hid her face on Amanda's shoulder, but nodded her agreement for the treat.
They went to the kitchen, where an older girl sat at the table reading a book.
"Deborah, we have company."
Mrs. Collins spoke to the girl and introduced Amanda and Grace.
Deborah smiled shyly at them and then said, "It's nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hello, Grace."
"You must be one of the children from the orphan train," Amanda said to Deborah.
"Welcome to Maple Grove."

She use to tell me to check my shoes before I put them on, because aliens may be hiding in them."
Dayna scratched her forehead lightly.
"Come to think of it now, that entire statement was true."
Lillian released herself of a low breath.
She got up, and with a slight buzz in her step, made her way through the blast double doors.
"Where are you going?"
Chimed out Dayna from behind her.
Without looking back, Lillian continued to walk.
"Out to find some fresh air."
Dayna's voice became muddled with distance, and the thickness of the corridors rock walls.
Lillian knew where she wanted to go, but not how to get there.
She figured she would make use of Bear, her own Bio-engineered, artificial reference.
And with a question, she was escorted to just where she wanted to be.
The night was humid, briskly cool and partially clear.
The moon shone brightly through patches of spotted purple clouds.
When the stars broke through the thick blankets of water vapor, they sparkled like diamonds, attracting Lillian's eyes.
She inhaled deeply for the scent of the creosote bush hung heavy in the air.
The smell brought back memories, and the stars brought back uncertainty.
Lillian took herself as far as the overhead flood lights would take her, to the edge of a very steep cliff.
She sat, allowing her legs to hang.
