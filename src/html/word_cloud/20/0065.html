This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.         The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.       The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.       Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.       Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance to other potential Audience members.       Due to the high quality of previous Performances, Performers can become famous, i.e. well known and liked.  Those who like them particularly well become fans of the Performer.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

                        <pre>
It was like she was his favorite type of music.
The way she talked, the way she sighed almost constantly, like every statement was life-altering.
He tried not to stare at her too much.
He thought back to their first meeting, and how a wave of panic had crushed him in the undertow.
But of course, here he was, in an illicit situation yet again.
Did he only like women who had an intimate connection to his close friends and/or family members?
"I saw you once.
I was with my mom.
She told me you were staring at me."
He almost choked again.
"When?"
"You were on a date with this girl.
I can't even remember where.
You and I caught a glimpse of each other, and my mom made some comment about you.
I think she liked you, and she doesn't like people much anymore."
Every word she said was a melody, every breath a punctuated note.
He realized grimly that even though he hadn't had a sip of booze, his mind was befuddled with the dramatics of the past few months.
He wanted clarity.
"Raina?"
"Yes?"

                        <br/>
                        <pre>
"Hungry?"
she asked.
"Affirm" Jon said.
KT picked up the unopened can and tossed it to the young man "rations" she said, "shall I open it for you?"
she asked with a slight smile.
But Jon needed no help in that area, "Gripper, opener" he ordered.
"Affirm" said the hand.
Instantly a small cutting blade shot out of the index finger and Jon used it to open the container, he took a whiff of the contents and it made his nose revolt so he took his finger and put it into the mixture.
"Gripper, report" he said.
After a few moments of processing he received the information he sought, "Substance is a mixture of animal body parts and organic fillers with a substantial quantity of preservatives; it is safe to digest".
It took only a short time for Jon to empty the contents of the can and he had to admit that he did feel much better.
"Your arm is very useful" KT commented.
"My mother gave it to me" Jon replied.
With her belly full the young girl prepares for sleep, she takes off her helmet and takes a small device from her belt, it is the size of a small Peck-bird egg, she puts it on the floor near her and presses a small button on its top, immediately a phantom like ring surrounds her emitting a low hum.
"It's an alarm field" KT says, "if you come within range I will kill you truce or no truce, you comp that metal-head?"
Jon sits leaning against a broken table, he removes the mechanical arm from his elbow and puts it in front of him, and a small LED light begins to blink on the little finger.
"My hand never sleeps" he said.
KT makes a grunting sound then sits back facing her enemy; she holds her knife at the ready and slowly closes her eyes.
Jon doesn't know why but he can't seem to take his eyes off of her, there is something about the line of her strong body that arouses strong feeling inside him, the way the moonlight falls on her face, the shape of her lips and the long suppleness of her neck.
How long he continued to stare at the female Jon didn't know but after a time he closed his eyes in sleep.
