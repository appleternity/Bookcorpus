Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. "giant electronics company") and those describing sound volume ("in a tiny voice", "the enormous thundering of her heart").  \'\'  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a. Maturity and age also occur in non-productive metaphors ("big boy", "little baby").'}, {'frame': 'Hedging', 'tfidf': 1.4818616755291847, 'lexical_unit': 'a bit.n / sort of.adv / like.adv / kind of.adv / on the side.a / something.n / in a way.adv / rather.adv', 'definition': 'When words of this frame are used as hedge markers, they signal that the speaker of the sentence wishes to be careful about asserting some Hedged_content.  Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they\'re expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context.   \'The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy .\' \'I \'m sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand .\' \'I thought, like, maybe you would know .\' \'My father was something of a dilettante .\' \'He rather doubts you\'ll be able to convince your mom. \' \'\' Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:  \'Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side .\' \'\' There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following:  \'When a standard vaccuum can\'t even pick up the clods, you know you\'ve kinda got a problem.\' \'\' Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., "a tad", "a little", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number ("a little whiskey", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average ("a mite stupid", "somewhat confused" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category ("something of a klutz"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition ("I, like, waved it around").  In both cases, the Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting.'}, {'frame': 'Taking_time', 'tfidf': 1.4730962202577018, 'lexical_unit': 'take.v / in.prep / fast.a / quick.a / rapid.a / swift.a / speedy.a / slowly.adv / slow.a / gradually.adv / quickly.adv', 'definition': "An Activity takes some Time_length to complete.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

"It worked!"
"Good job, we make a pretty good team," Jane praised as she walked over to her desk and pulled out a black bottle with a raven etched on the front.
"I think this calls for a little celebration."
"Sounds good to me," Logan agreed as he turned his attention to the three locations on the maps.
"So what are these places anyway?"
"I don't really remember what the locations actually were," Jane confessed as she filled two tumblers.
"I was concentrating on the pin groupings.
What are the names?"
"The first is Harrow's End," Logan called out.
"It's on the far east coast of the Island."
"Well that's actually a nice spot," Jane explained as she walked over and handed him a glass.
They clinked them together and each took a well earned drink.
"There's a large Greek style pavilion there and a really nice beach.
The Hunt members use it during the summer months when the weather is nicer.
What's the second?"
"Umm, the Crows Nest," he confirmed after re-reading the strange name on the map.
"I'm very familiar with that place," Jane scowled remembering her last visit to the place.
Along with Lord Lodge, she had been imprisoned there by Dr. Cleaver in his bid to take power.
"It's basically a Viking stronghold perched on a mountain cliff."
"Sounds intense," Logan offered appreciatively.

I help you with your chores while I'm here.
I saved you, you should like me."
Betty had grown accustomed to not being liked.
Her whole life she'd felt different from everyone around her.
The best shot she had was wearing people down.
Being around until they warmed up to her.
But so far with Alma it hadn't worked.
"It was easier before when I was just supposed to not trust any white person ever.
That was the rule my mama gave me.
Keep to myself.
Be respectful.
Apologize for being in the way.
Now you've got me wondering which ones are the bad apples and which ones might be all right.
I liked it better when I didn't have to think about it."
Alma folded the clothes on the table quickly, looking like she'd rather be anywhere else.
But Betty knew the tiny shack left nowhere to hide.
"Sorry for making you use your brain," Betty shot back jokingly.
"You should know, though, I'm not going anywhere.
My plan is to keep coming here and keep trying to understand the world best I can.
You don't have to like me.
