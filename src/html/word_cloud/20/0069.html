        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

I walked over to the nurse's station and sit, trying to bring up the feed from the lobby.
I tune in in time to see the team standing, facing a lone man, who was surrounded by guards.
The other workers watched on as the madness continued, as did I.
There was no audio, I just watched.
I wondered what the man was doing.
He was a regular guy, could have been anyone walking down the street.
It took a few minutes before I noticed he was holding something, a canister.
Before my eyes, he lifted the canister over his head and with one small, graceful sweep, he sparked a flame, setting himself on fire!
The fire spread so fast that I would have sworn it was some sort of magic.
The man did not scream and he not flail, he merely fell to the ground, crisping in front of us.
I let out an audible gasp, turning from the screen.
I stood from the chair and backed away from the screen.
"Overkill?"
I turned to see Maksim standing at the doors.
I stared at him, his eyes calmer than anyone's in the whole building.
The disgust must have registered because he smirked and tilted his head to me.
"But tell Steven that...you know him."
Maksim said quickly, "It was easy to get in here...might want to check that security."
"You bastard."
I spat.

She opened her eyes and smiled at him.
His heart tumbled and he knew without any doubts that he was in love with her.
He hugged her close to steady his heartbeat.
"Should we go home or do you want to stay here longer?"
"Home?
Oh no, I am supposed to be working.
How long have we been out here?
Aren't you supposed to be working?"
"Hey, relax.
I am not cleared to work yet so no I am not supposed to be working.
You can take a morning off; I don't think David or Dalton will fire you."
She stopped and took a deep breath "Sorry I panicked there for a minute.
It is my ranch too, I can take time off."
Nick took her by the hand and led her to the cabin.
He pulled the key from his pocket and opened the door.
"Now you take me into the cabin.
I was tied up on the ground but no, NOW, I get to go in the cabin."
"I thought you might want to freshen up.
You are a bit of a mess from the ground.
I have an extra shirt in the closet."
