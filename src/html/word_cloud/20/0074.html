Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

My ankle twisted all the way around, but I didn't hear it snap.
But it hurt like it had.
For a second I thought I saw my life flashing before my eyes, but then I realized it was just helpless tears streaming down liberally.
And it was just a sprained ankle.
Thoughts of dread and anguish tried to push away the pain with little success.
I looked at my ankle, trapped under the root, and twisted all the way around.
It was swelling noticeably, and the circulation was sure to be cut off if I didn't get it out from under the root.
If I tugged, I would scream from torment.
But if I didn't, I wasn't sure what would happen.
I was on my own.
I had to make my own life or limb-saving decisions.
My ankle was already the size of an orange.
I winced every time I looked at it.
But nonetheless, I had to look at it as I pulled the root from the ground to free my ankle.
Remembering that I was on a mission, I looked up to see how far the soldiers had gotten.
They were grapes in the distance.
Why was I thinking about food?
"No!
We are late already."
I heard them shouting in the distance.

                        <pre>
A smell as of lightning filled Azure Bloodstone's nostrils, and a split second later a thunderous cracking sound broke out.
Lightning jumped from the pearl spheres and struck the gryphon, who began shaking uncontrollably.
The smell of burning fur and feathers filled the air, and the gryphon cried out in agony as black patches on its fur appeared wherever the lightning struck it.
After five minutes of this torture, the gryphon went completely limp.
The elf pressed a switch, pulled the lever, cursed loudly, and went and removed the dead gryphon from the manacles that kept it strung up.
The gryphon's body slumped onto the floor and four assistant elves came in and removed it.
As the archmage pressed switches on the switchboard Azure Bloodstone studied the room from his vantage-point.
There were only two entrances - large, heavy stone doors on the floor below, and no windows apart from the tiny barred window that Azure was looking through.
Directly below the archmage there were several books on a small table.
One of them was open and an assistant elf was reading it.
The assistant walked out.
Azure Bloodstone looked at the book; it was very old, split along the middle.
The binding could be seen, clearly exposed, in the middle of the book.
Another elf entered the cavern.
This one wore shiny black military armour, probably a grandmaster, or possibly even the military chancellor, who was an elf famous in the Nomoi Empire for his dedication to the Emperor.
His voice carried well in the huge cavern as he said, "The Emperor asks, how do the experiments come along?
He wishes to know."
"We have no success as yet.
But the experiments lately have been very promising, very promising."
"Have you need of more resources?
