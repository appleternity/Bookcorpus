There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Plaintively, he said, "That's all.
Can't see...no more."
"He sees through their eyes, hears through the ears of the animal," the scientist looked ecstatic.
"He feels what they feel."
He poked the rhesus with a prod and the boy's reactions were the same, his face grimacing in pain.
"His pain responses are the same as the rhesus, their brain waves are patterned exactly the same."
Gaines mused, "My Labrador retriever was in the bedroom when I told my wife about the Senator.
Christ, that's the connection we were looking for - every one of these leaks had a pet involved.
Dogs, cats, even a Goddamn parrot!
"Can you imagine the implications, doctor?
Donate a trained falcon to the Sultan of OPEC and know exactly their policies before they make them?
A trained dog to the President of Russia? 90% of foreign leaders have pets.
We could spy on anyone without risking an agent's life!"
"We don't know how far his range is," he warned.
"Or how long he can meld.
I suspect the use has short and long-term damage effects to his brain.
Perhaps, it triggered the neurological storm he was in Walter Reed for.
His original scans indicated a serious, perhaps fatal condition."
"And now?"
Gaines asked.

"To get them to their full velocity," she said,"twist all the way back on this end."
Ioma demonstrated on her device.
The stream of air coming from the simple looking black pipe paused for a moment as it prepped for a large exhale.
The graduate assistants could hear the device sucking air in from tiny pores within its metal frame.
A smooth but loud roar then came from the opposite end of the pipe and Ioma immediately turned it toward the Antiopian sand, which parted in a circular fashion for her as she moved it over the flat, metal structure that was now being revealed.
Brian and Elizabeth followed suit and soon the whisk of air was all that could be heard as the metal roof of the possibly ancient structure came to be revealed again.
Brian was the first to uncover an opening in the metallic roof and he had to walk over to Ioma, tapping her in order to interrupt her intense focus on spreading sand with air.
Ioma walked over to where Brian indicated and saw a square opening in the metal that led down into blackness.
She looked around for the nearest combustor, spotting one not far off.
From her mission suit she unwound some black line and signaled to Brian to go to the combustor and attach it so she could descend.
Brian obeyed.
Ioma activated the green glow of her mission suit before jumping into the blackness.
The suit illuminated pictures on the ceiling of the structure as she lowered herself into it.
She positioned her body so the light revealed the artwork--hand painted depictions showed men and women much like the statues.
The paintings again detailed these people bowing down to some being.
Ioma looked closely for any writing to shed light on what all this meant but found none.
She released more line from her suit and lowered herself deeper into the structure.
The square of light that was the opening above Ioma became smaller and she could now only faintly make out two small objects, their curious heads peering over the side of the entrance.
She let out length after length of the thin, black line allowing her to descend further into the darkness.
The green illumination of her suit pierced the darkness only inches before being overtaken by the absence of light that had been present there for untold fathoms of time.
