        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Rather than having you repeat what you already said, my reaction was meant to elicit some kind of an explanation from you."
"An explanation?
Well," Varello says, "the girl, Desa, will keep the dragon safe from soldiers, and the dragon will keep the girl safe from everything else.
At the time, it seemed like a perfectly reasonable plan."
"And if she uses this dragon to hitch a ride to someplace populated, like, say, I don't know, Claustria, what then?"
"Relax," Varello says, "Kragnar is not going to bring her here."
"Kragnar?
You do know he tried to eat me, right?"
"Did he?
Well, that just proves how refined his tastes really are."
"Be that as it may, we need to find a more permanent solution to the problem of Desa Mu," Madra says.
"What do you mean by 'permanent,' Your Majesty?
I thought you were against a 'permanent' solution to the Desa situation."
Varello asks.
"Marchand passed this morning.
She is responsible for the deaths of dozens of my people."
Madra says, starting to get annoyed.
"So are you," Varello retorts, "but I don't see anyone trying to solve you for X because of it."
"Are you kidding?
People try to kill me all the time.

"Wade, Jake and I have been sneaking to see each other.
I was afraid to bother Aunt Suellen, and she could not relinquish Prissy to chaperone, for she needed as much help as she could get when Will was sick."
Tears began to run down her face, and she buried her head in her lap.
When she stopped crying, she lifted her face.
Wade could see the fear in her eyes, and she looked like a small frightened kitten.
"Wade, I am in trouble.
Jake and I have to be married soon.
In a few weeks, I will start to show, and everyone will know."
Wade stared at her, unsure of what she meant then realization hit him.
She had spent time with a young man, whom he suddenly remembered she had mentioned on his last visit.
They had intended to be married, but had committed marital acts before the ceremony.
Now, because she had been left alone, she was in trouble that would not only reflect on her, but on her unborn child, and the rest of the family.
His mind raced, uncertain of solutions, but certain of where to place blame.
His mind raced back to the words of his mother so long ago when she relayed his responsibility to his younger sister.
He had not been here to protect his younger sister.
He had shirked his responsibilities in order to attend school which meant nothing now.
He was to blame for her misfortune, and he would have to find a solution somehow.
As he gazed at his sister sitting beside him, his pulse slowed as he realized that she was a scared young child with no where else to turn.
He delicately patted her hand, trying to comfort her, but she could not calm down until she knew that everything would be fine, and at this moment he had no guarantee.
"Don't worry, Ella, I will think of something.
