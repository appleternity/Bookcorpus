Some members of this frame indicate the plexity of the Ground, as either single-entity gestalt (inside), two-entity or bi-partite gestalt (between.prep), and multiple-entity or multipart gestalt (among.prep, amid.prep), while others are maximally general (in.prep).   \'\'  This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary.  In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion ("in a box"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change ("in the garden").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  \'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .\' \'My keys were in the street .\' \'Step back outside . CNI DNI \' \'She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .\' \'I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI\' \'They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI\' \'Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .\' \'We talked outside the office .\' \'\'  This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event.  (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) \'The pole snapped off in her hand .\' \'She combed her hair between her fingers .\' \'\'  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: \'Inside my wallet is where i put it .\' \'Outside your blind date\'s door seems like the worst place in the world .\' \'\'  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: \'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  \'Is the economy in recession ?\' \'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI \' \'\'  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer\'s mind (construed as a Ground): \'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI\' \'I felt an unease inside me .\' \'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .\' \'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .\' \'\'  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): \'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .\' \'There are so many children in the family .\' \'\'  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: \'amid the confusion\' \'inside the competition period\' \'between lunch and dinner\' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word "period") while others can take events as Grounds directly. \'\'  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): \'In the paper , `` self-control \'\' is used to mean a sense of willpower .\' \'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .\' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. \'\' \'\'  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

She turned to see what he was looking at but there was nothing there.
Lucian pulled his eyes back to hers.
"Yeah.
Sure.
Whatever you say."
"Okay."
Molly frowned as she walked over to the golf cart.
Lucian climbed in on the other side and started the engine.
The ride to the mine was nothing like the day before.
Yesterday while riding with Lucian in the cart, Molly had felt a mixture of shyness and exhilaration.
Now though, she was feeling more dread than anything else and couldn't quite figure out why.
Lucian turned the cart into the mine and pulled up in front of the gray clapboard building just like he did the day before.
This time the chairs weren't rocking out of time with one another but remained still.
Almost too still, he thought, considering the way the wind was whipping.
Trying to ignore the trepidation he was feeling, he got out of the cart and followed Molly up the stairs.
"The mine isn't open today?"
Lucian asked as Molly pulled keys out of her pocket to unlock the door.
"No.
Not today."
"How'd you get the keys?"

"I told you to shut up."
"The bottle wasn't poisoned?
All these years I believed one was poisoned.
I could have drunk either of them?"
"Forget it."
"I could have drunk either of them."
"Paul, you need to be very careful around Gregory.
There isn't any dog here to die for you this time.
You're never going to get off of this planet and as long as you are here there is no place you can hide."
Paul didn't respond.
Gregory was going to need him for the colonization of Zoltos.
This was an opportunity to better his situation, but he was going to need to keep his wits about himself - and get up off of the floor.
He stood and walked over to the seat he'd been using to watch the ceremony.
He sat down and looked directly at Ed.
"You're right Ed.
I've been acting like a fool.
After the visitors leave we'll have a lot of work to do.
Zoltos must be a success."
At breakfast the next morning Paul saw Glendral in the cafeteria and decided to see what she thought about what was going to happen next on Zoltos.
He had a pounding headache and hangover, she looked very tired.
