A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Age', 'tfidf': 1.1871487631356004, 'lexical_unit': 'old.a / ancient.a / young.a / youngish.a / oldish.a / age.n / new.a / fresh.a / of.prep / maturity.n / mature.a / elderly.a', 'definition': "An Entity has existed for a length of time, the Age.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

Drew cleared his throat, "How did you wind up here?"
Angelique shuddered, "I left Faid because the Boche took my house and was on my way to Sfax to see if I could stay with some acquaintances."
"To Sfax?"
Drew sat up straight.
"Do you know Sfax?"
She gave him a puzzled glance, "I have been there a few times.
Why, Monsieur Matthews?"
"Call me Drew," after all if he can do it, so can I, Drew thought to himself.
Angelique gave him a shy smile.
Drew went on, "Have you heard of a cafe called Le Belle Francais?"
"Le Belle Francais?"
she repeated, and then, "Oh, oh yes, I have been there once or twice.
Why, mons...Drew?"
Drew leaned forward in his intensity, "I need to go to that cafe, could you take me there?"
Angelique drew back in horror, "Non, non, how could I lead you Americans into there?
We would all be killed!"
Her nerves were shot and she started shaking.
Dane reached out and took her hand, which she grasped like a lifeline, "Captain, let's wait until she's rested before asking her any more, she's had a bad day.
Let her get a good rest tonight and talk to her in the morning."
"Tonight," she repeated, and then her eyes opened wide in terror, "They were, they were going to take turns at me tonight!"

"A curious one, I guess."
"Young man, you have the kind of gift this world needs.
I'd like to help you develop that gift.
Assuming you're interested."
"Help me how?"
"Attend Harvard as a full-time student.
I can see to it that finances aren't an issue.
I'll make sure a course of study is designed for you that will unlock your full potential.
You can't waste this gift, Austin.
Minds like yours come along but once in a generation."
"Thank you, sir.
I don't know what to say."
"Start by saying yes, or at least think about it.
You don't have to decide today."
"Okay.
Thank you," he said, feeling self-conscious for the awkward way the words came out.
"Thank you."
The professor handed a business card to Austin.
"Call my office and we'll schedule a time to meet.
All right?"
