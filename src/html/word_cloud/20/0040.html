These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Condition_symptom_relation', 'tfidf': 2.3696668719942164, 'lexical_unit': 'manifest.v / manifest.n / present.v / symptom.n / symptomatic.a / asymptomatic.a / cause.v / cause.n / associate.v / mimic.v / show.v / see.v / produce.v / link.v / include.v / relate.v / characterize.v / due to.prep / result.v / consequence.n / contribute.v / induce.v / present.a / provoke.v / result.n / lead.v / indicate.v / uncommon.a / common.a / suggest.v / damage.v / occur.v / observe.v / characteristic.n / frequent.a', 'definition': "A Patient has a Medical_condition that can be understood by its Symptoms.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"What?"
"You're fired.
You know we have a zero-tolerance policy for racism here at United Media Corp.
See, look, it's right here on page 137 of our employee manual.
It says it right there, we here at United Media Corp. have a zero-tolerance policy for racism."
She spoke rapid fire.
"I know what the policy is!
What on earth did I do that was racist?
And I'm Asian!
Doesn't that at least count for something anymore?"
"Yes, you being Asian definitely counts for something.
But unfortunately, it doesn't give you free reign to blatantly disrespect African-Americans.
You see African-Americans have had a unique experience in American history."
She paused a moment.
"Editor Bernstein told me about the last article you wrote."
She picked up a copy of his article from her desk and read.
"African-Americans make up 13% of the population, but commit 52% of the crime."
She looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
"Care to explain why you wrote that?"
"Because it is a verifiable fact."

He was beginning to feel the upper hand.
"He said absolutely nothing about you and Werle.
But I know."
"Not again," she sounded angry.
"I thought we had been through this at least a dozen times.
Of course, he said nothing, as there was nothing to be said."
After a second's pause of hesitation he murmured: "I overheard them.
I mean the Werles the other night.
They were talking about us, and Werle admitted it.
Everything."
She looked fiercely at him.
She threw the book on the ground and jumped out of bed.
"How dare you?
Are you calling me a liar?"
"No," he was annoyed at himself for being unable to confront her and was once again retreating.
He was afraid of losing her, he just wanted her to come begging for forgiveness that he then could gallantly grant her.
This would have made him feel good.
"And what if?"
she asked on the offensive.
"You have no right to question my life, especially the things that had happened before I met you.
