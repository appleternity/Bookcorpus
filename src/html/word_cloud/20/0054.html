'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Desiring', 'tfidf': 2.515328541803979, 'lexical_unit': 'want.v / desire.v / desire.n / desirous.a / lust.n / lust.v / hunger.v / hunger.n / hungry.a / thirst.n / thirst.v / thirsty.a / long.v / longing.n / urge.n / aspire.v / wish.n / wish (that).v / eager.a / hanker.v / hankering.n / aspiration.n / crave.v / craving.n / yearn.v / yen.n / yearning.n / wants.n / hope.v / hope.n / covet.v / covetous.a / will.v / wish.v / yen.v / ambition.n / feel like.v / interested.a / in the hope of.prep / raring.a / spoiling.a / dying.a / fancy.v / pine.v / ache.v / desired.a / will.n / itch.v / loath.a / reluctant.a / care.v / in hopes of.prep / impulse.n', 'definition': "An Experiencer desires that an Event occur.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

A bang followed by a cry on the other side of the door suggested that Patrew might've tried using only his fist or shoulder to break in. Halscrad then faced Embekah again.
"Well, I'm glad you remembered you're a wizard, too," Embekah said, a light air of annoyance subtly departing from her throat.
"I doubt your little trick will keep them at bay for long.
They seem to know everything there is about the nature of barriers."
Halscrad nodded.
"There's just got to be some means of stopping them.
What's his weakness?"
"Aside from his arrogance, there might be one way to get at him," Embekah looked up at the door, "but I might not have time to act on it."
"Just do it.
I'll have your back."
In that moment, the muscles in her throat constricted, almost to the point where she caused herself to pass out.
She'd heard those words many times before.
Only now, they seemed to have genuine meaning supporting them.
Halscrad seemed to notice her reluctance.
"What's wrong?"
"I'm sorry.
What you just said threw me off a little."
Embekah shook her head with much disdain.
"I'm not sure what to make of it."
"I see," Halscrad said, clasping her shoulder.

Shouts floated in his direction as enemy soldiers spotted him, but he refused to take his eyes away from the lift.
Jarvaad and his group of men stood in a half-circle formation in front of the doors, blasting away at Truce's followers so that the path would remain clear for Muert.
A brilliant yellow aura to the right attracted Muert's eyes, and his heart nearly stopped as a giant stream of energy that almost resembled molten rock burst from the hands of a Kyrosen who sat atop one of his comrade's shoulders.
Before Muert could react, Jarvaad launched himself into the air, arms and legs spread far apart so that his body might take the brunt of the blast.
Instinct clashed with duty as Muert screamed out, arms reaching for Jarvaad while his feet propelled him toward the now-open lift doors.
His fingers barely grazed the back of his comrade's vest before the churning energy engulfed Jarvaad with a thunderous roar.
Muert screamed and leapt for the lift as the man's body was thrown into the wall like a child's doll.
When he opened his eyes, Muert was lying beside the lift, and the group of soldiers standing guard had expanded to surround him.
Next to him, a burned and bloody Jarvaad looked up at him with wide eyes.
"Go, Boss," he whispered.
His entire body was little more than a smoldering and charred corpse, but he still had a few moments of life left.
He visibly struggled to speak, watery eyes wincing with every word.
"Free us from his reign.
Allow us to be who ... we really are, not the mindless killers ... he's made us into."
With an exhausted groan, he slumped back against the wall, eyes eternally staring into nothingness.
"Boss," a woman called from the wall of Kyrosen protecting him.
"We'd better get moving."
"Right," Muert reluctantly agreed.
He took one last look at Jarvaad before rising.
"Your death will not be in vein, my friend."
