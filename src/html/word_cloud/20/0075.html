Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

The landmarks now seemed so obvious that she wondered how she'd missed them before.
One in particular, was a simple white orb resting atop a pedestal.
The orb's surface was smooth and polished like marble, but had a translucency and a certain clarity that was unlike any marble she'd seen before.
In certain angles, when the pedestal was lost from her sight, the orb appeared to float in midair.
It was absolutely surreal.
She fixated on it as they drove by, trying to take in its simple but fascinating beauty for as long as possible.
"That ball is a good one to remember.
It's really powerful," Josh stated, his eyes fixed on the road.
"What are they for?"
"Some are shields, some are totems.
That one you just spotted is an amplifier.
It increases the strength of our shields."
He slowed as he came upon a bend.
Ellie looked outside her window and enjoyed the passing scenery of the majestic woods.
The light dimmed momentarily as they passed under a thick canopy of leaves.
The sound of a raven's call echoed from the treetops, diverting her attention to find the bird.
She looked up and glimpsed the swaying of branches and the silhouette of a large black bird flying across the sky.
She caught motion from the corner of her eye and turned her gaze quickly.
In her periphery, she saw a figure of a man standing near a giant redwood.
Uncertainty crinkled her brows.

"What's the use of the lifeboat, if you are not going to use it?
If the Alma is forced ashore, all hands will be lost.
Mr Medcroft you are taking risks with other men's lives."
Harry said to him, "Mind your own business.
No distress signal has been raised.
That crew is safer where they are at present."
Harry could only wait and see.
It was a trying time for all concerned.
Watching and waiting was testing their patience.
About midday the main anchor chain snapped under the terrible strain on it.
The 1st Mate ran the Alma ashore in a little inlet on to some rocks; underneath a cliff.
The bow was stuck fast.
Harry and the lifeboat crew reacted quickly; taking their rescue apparatus to the cliff top above the Alma.
The first rocket was fired with a line attached.
It was too high and the gale force wind drove it away from the stern of the Alma.
The line was dragged back and attached to a second rocket.
Harry had the elevation lowered and fired the second rocket.
This was a mistake as the rope was now heavier through being dragged through the sea after the first attempt.
The line fell short!
The third and last rocket was prepared for firing.
