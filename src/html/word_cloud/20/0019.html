Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

But, if Brother Mike continued, then Barry would have to bring the matter before the Headmaster.
However Billy was not as mature as Barry and eventually erupted.
Brother Mike was teaching geography, white man's geography, and asked Billy where the Murray River began.
'Don't give a shit!'
Billy retorted.
'Who gives a shit where the fucking river starts?
I just know it passes through the land of my people, the Yorta-Yorta people, and we used to fish from it for food until it was stuffed up by you white mongrels.'
Silence crashed down on the class as everyone looked to see how Brother Mike would respond to Billy's outburst.
Brother Mike looked stunned; no one had ever spoken back to him like that.
Shock gave way to fury; his face went purple as his blood pressure climbed dangerously high.
'How dare you!
How dare you Yorta ...'
'My names' Billy!
Billy Yorta ...'
'...
DON'T YOU DARE INTERRUPT ME!
Just who do you think you are, talking like that, not just to your teacher, but to a man of god?'
Into the silence he continued, 'This is because that miserable show-off Thomson has allowed you too much leeway.
Because of all the favoritism he's given you, you think you can insult your teacher and get away with it.
Well, I'll show you just ...'

Newark, New Jersey, became his next home when an aunt and an uncle adopted him.
They lived in a house with no music.
The auto repair shop that his uncle owned was a front for a car theft ring.
Stolen cars were dismantled and the parts found their way into the market place.
Bulldog began working in the shop when he was seventeen.
At eighteen he was stealing two cars a week and making good money.
Eventually he was caught and given a light sentence, but prison was not a deterrent, and Bulldog learned to make bigger plans.
He had gotten careless when he was twenty-three.
The police traced his fingerprints at a crime scene, and a cop who was on the take tipped him off.
The "virtuoso turned criminal" had to disappear forever, and that is what he was doing at H & H Auto Body, disappearing.
Living under a rock.
Doing jobs for the Lopezes.
Bulldog retained his nickname but began going by the name Sydney Finch.
Sydney Finch had been a little known composer from Philadelphia.
Bulldog recalled that his father had admired Finch's Concerto Number Four in F Major entitled Memoires d'enfance.
The Lopezes tapped into Bulldog's ability to deactivate car alarms.
Young Hector would take orders for high-end automobiles from customers in Mexico.
He would next track down a vehicle in the Flagstaff area that matched the description and send Bulldog to make the "acquisition."
The Dog lived alone and had few expenses; his truck and music were it.
Working in the body shop was largely just to force him out of bed.
