        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

The rain starts to fall, that's good timing.
I get under the cover of the porch, greeting the two girls.
The sky is getting darker and the temperature is dropping.
This could be an interesting night.
Two men join us under the porch, they're white Zimbabweans.
Now we are five.
The rain is getting heavier.
There are some big bolts of lighting flashing above; they make a sizzling sound around us.
They're followed by some mighty cracks of thunder which makes the porch floor vibrate.
We're joined by another couple, a man and woman, they're drenched.
Now we are seven.
Everyone starts to bed down on the porch.
I'm tucked into my sleeping bag, head inside I zip myself up.
The storm is becoming very violent; the claps of thunder seem a little too close for comfort.
I hear a noise on my sleeping bag, unzipping I put my head out.
The wind is blowing the rain in under the porch.
Now we have a big problem, no cover.
Getting wet up here in the cold could give you hypothermia.
My sleeping bag is only thin and I only have a lightweight top.
After some discussion, we all agree that we need to be inside the hut.

There was no way any of them would be able to access it.
In fact, if it wasn't back in Gunner's possession within twenty-four hours, a signal would be sent to the complex.
Gunner imagined Auden, Nico, Marcus, and the rest of the Anathergian warriors picking these men apart, and sucked in his lips to stop his grin.
Juan slipped the phone into the inside pocket of his jacket and then pushed Gunner forward with the business end of his Uzi.
Gunner ambled toward the door, wondering why they hadn't checked him for weapons.
And then he remembered where he was.
A geek house.
Of course, he was one of those geeks, but it didn't mean he didn't know how to handle a weapon or even have one for that matter.
Well, you know what they say about people who assume.
Dumb asses.
Juan and Marcel closed in behind him.
At the doorway, he glanced over his shoulder at Nay and gave her a reassuring smile.
Then he scowled at the leader.
If the bastard lays a hand on her, I'm going full out.
Fuck not letting anyone know what I am.
That'd mean he'd have to kill all of them.
Except Nay, of course.
Protecting humans is what the Anathergians do, and they try their damndest to follow that motto.
But there were exceptions to every rule.
However, he wouldn't break that rule and kill any humans until he had to.
