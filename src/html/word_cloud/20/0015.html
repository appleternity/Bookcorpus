'The grill, unsecured, rolled a few feet across the yard.'  'The swarm went away to the end of the hall.'  The frames that inherit the general Motion frame add some elaboration to this simple idea.  Inheriting frames can add Goal-profiling (arrive, reach), Source-profiling (leave, depart), or Path-profiling (traverse, cross), or aspects of the manner of motion (run, jog) or assumptions about the shape-properties, etc., of any of the places involved (insert, extract). A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'

In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion ("in a box"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change ("in the garden").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  \'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .\' \'My keys were in the street .\' \'Step back outside .

(When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) \'The pole snapped off in her hand .\' \'She combed her hair between her fingers .\' \'\'  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: \'Inside my wallet is where i put it .\' \'Outside your blind date\'s door seems like the worst place in the world .\' \'\'  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: \'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  \'Is the economy in recession ?\' \'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI \' \'\'  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer\'s mind (construed as a Ground): \'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI\' \'I felt an unease inside me .\' \'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .\' \'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .\' \'\'  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): \'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .\' \'There are so many children in the family .\' \'\'  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: \'amid the confusion\' \'inside the competition period\' \'between lunch and dinner\' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word "period") while others can take events as Grounds directly. \'\'  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): \'In the paper , `` self-control \'\' is used to mean a sense of willpower .\' \'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .\' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. \'\' \'\'  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

'We haven't grinned much since we won the money, have we?
I did so like to see you smile when you had a little win, now and again, on the scratch-lottery-tickets.'
'Oh, Jack, but what about if we should have a big win,' Helen said, fearfully.
'What then?
How would we handle it?'
'Ah!
Next time, we'll have had the benefit of experience and we wouldn't make the same mistakes twice, would we?
Besides, I couldn't fit another thing in my wardrobe, could you... in yours?'
'No.
I think I'll have to chuck some of that stuff out.
Hey!
We could take some of that gear with us, to the Sally Army, eh?
My surplus stuff and yours!'
'Sure.
Now, you know that bit about 'Winners Are Grinners'?
Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm grinning already!'
He smacked her on the backside and said 'Now get up them stairs.'

It was a Monday and Jimmy Cockerel was walking the streets of Brisbane in a pensive mood.

He knows it's going to be very demanding in every way, and he's kicking against it."
"But he's usually such a nice guy!"
Sylvia exclaimed.
"So he is, but he's come to a major turning point in his life, one which will not only change the way he views himself and the rest of creation, but will alter his very existence.
Life has given him a mighty kick up the arse-part.
It seems that that is the only way sometimes to get people to go in the direction that's best for them.
It can appear to be cruel, but it's not.
It's just necessary, for him."
Anthony stood up and collected the coffee cups.
"Don't worry.
He'll be back."
He said as he walked over to the bar.
"So, how do you know?"
Anthony pointed under the table, where Charlie smiled, and wagged her tail.
And come back, he did, full of apologies.
"I'm so sorry, Anthony.
I just don't know what the hell's going on.
I don't know what to do, what I should be doing, where I'm going or....I'm just so confused."
"First of all, there's no need to apologise.
Second, sit down and take a deep breath.
