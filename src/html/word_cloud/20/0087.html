        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"You know, you can Google that stuff, right?
You don't need to ask me?"
I am a bitch sometimes...
"Alright..."
"I'm sorry," I sigh.
"It's just...I'm so frickin' pissed at Uncle Marty.
He's making this vacation suck completely."
Josh sets down his magazine and sits up on the couch.
"Well, we're pretty close to finding the Dumnonian Hoard...and that won't suck!"
I feel a smile tugging at the corners of my lips.
"I know."
"We still need to find some rope so we can climb down that hole."
"That's exactly what I was just thinking about.
But where could we find some rope around here..."
Josh looks thoughtful.
"How about the shed out back?"
"Oh my god!
Of course!
I could actually hug you right now!"

I haven't a penny piece as I can call my own now.
Missus, she earns money enough, but she won't give me none o' it for a drop.
I'm very badly off."
"You ought to go to Miss Mowbray, and not come to me.
She told Pa to turn you away, very likely, and she made your wife and daughter abstainers.
You have her to thank for it all.
But here's a half-crown for you.
I can't speak to father just now about you.
I may another time; only if I do, you'll go on loving Miss Mowbray just the same as if she and not I had befriended you.
You're all so fond of her, that your master's daughter counts for nothing."
Louisa walked away, and the man, clutching the silver coin, and gazing at it with eager, unbelieving eyes, stumbled along the street to the nearest public house, which he entered and called for a glass of whisky and water.
He was already partially intoxicated, and Miss Marsh's words took hold of his muddled senses.
Evidently, Miss Marsh did not like the school mistress either.
She spoke as if she pitied him, and she had given him a half-crown.
Yes, he certainly was to be pitied, and of course it was all the fault of Miss Mowbray.
He saw that clearly enough now, though he hadn't seen it before.
Miss Marsh was kind and generous: Miss Mowbray hard and cruel.
Why should he let his daughter stay any longer at the school of such a woman?
True, the school belonged to Mr. Absalom Marsh, but he liked Miss Mowbray and employed her to teach his school.
He would be angry also if the girl was taken away, as taken away she most certainly should be, and this very day too.
