Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

No one was on their feet, and no one appeared to have moved.
It took Francis only a moment to understand.
However it happened, he'd said his confession to a layman.
His heart pounded.
He couldn't be found out.
He had unfinished business.
He watched him walk through the church.
The man didn't seem in a rush to leave.
If he'd heard his confession, he should be running to the police.
Most anyone would.
But maybe he only wanted Francis to think he hadn't heard him confess to murder.
Francis realized he couldn't take the chance the man hadn't heard anything and had one option-- he must silence the lanky man wearing sandals.
Chapter Three
I left the confessional and walked toward the altar, expecting to meet up with Father Ezra.
I didn't and peered around the church.
He was nowhere I could see, which puzzled me.
A moment ago, I heard him talking outside the priest's booth.
I took another look around and still didn't see him.
Perhaps it hadn't been his voice after all, or maybe I was hearing things.
That could be too.

He rubbed his cheek against her stomach, kissed her nipples with his lips, and lapped at the folds of her sex with his long tongue.
Not once, however, did he disobey by touching her with his hands.
"Well done, slave," she complimented, when at last, she was naked.
"Now, I need a bath after that long plane ride here.
Bathe me."
Ethan knew the perfect place to bathe his Mistress.
There was a natural hot spring pool near the cabin, where hot water bubbled from the earth.
Nearby was a waterfall of cool river water, giving bathers their choice of hot or cold water to soak in.
He carried Jocelyn to the pools and lovingly massaged her back with a soft cloth as she soaked in the soothing water.
After a while she gave him a massage of his own, rubbing his private organ until it was rigid and ready to explode.
Then she commanded him to make love to her in the rippling waters until they both orgasmed together.
Later that day, they made love again in the cabin, right in the middle of the living room floor and then again that night, in the luxurious bedroom, where she shackled Ethan to the headboard and he eagerly licked her folds until she orgasmed.
Then she allowed him to enter her and they thrust passionately together until she climaxed yet again and clung to him while his body shuddered with the ecstasy of his own orgasm.
"This is the perfect vacation," he said softly, as he stroked her long, dark hair and she cuddled him in the darkness.
Jocelyn agreed whole-heartedly and they drifted off to sleep together.
***
There was one person, however, who was not having a perfect time during their vacation; Chester Colder.
"What do you mean he can't be contacted?"
Chester shouted out hysterically into the phone.
He took a deep breath to calm himself.
