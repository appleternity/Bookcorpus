Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Process_completed_state', 'tfidf': 2.9437393008296864, 'lexical_unit': 'done.a / finished.a / complete.a / over.a', 'definition': "A Process is finished and can no longer proceed.

This frame contains verbs that participate in the ditransitive construction, with a recipient as the direct object, as in the following: 'I sent Bill the manuscript.' Certain Verbs in this Frame focus on the initial sending act, while others do not.  For example, I sent it rapidly can either mean the act of sending was initiated quickly or that it moved quickly.

A Means  has been created or is used to allow the creator or a user to achieve a  Goal.

In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talking about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .'

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

We were then informed the administrator was on his way.
Joni said, "We finally get a ship in from Orwall, and they drag us away.
I can't say I like that."
"I find it suspicious as well.
I know the administrator to be a busy man, but I have to wonder if his not being here is just a delay tactic while they're unloading that cargo."
Ten minutes passed while we waited patiently for whatever purpose the administrator had called the meeting.
I was agitated to the point of getting out of my chair to walk toward the door.
The Cardellian was waiting just outside.
"I apologize, Mr. Beutcher.
Administrator Ballis was held up in a meeting that ran long.
He should be here momentarily."
I returned to my chair with an angry expression on my face.
"If he isn't here in the next three minutes, we're going back out to that shipping bay."
The Cardellian nodded.
Three minutes to the second later, the administrator entered the conference room.
"I am so sorry.
I was delayed in a discussion about meeting our shipping quotas.
It seems your checks have slowed things down to the point of delaying some shipments.
However, you're not to worry over it, we are making adjustments."
I said, "Why did you call us in here?"

the woman asked.
"Of course it is, and we need to see your reservation list."
"Do you want me to get in touch with my supervisor?"
"Yes, please," Lang said as she dialed her phone.
"Are you calling the Captain?"
Genn asked.
"Yes, he's got to see the light with this new information on Elsie."
The woman clerk beckoned the detectives over to a computer screen while she was on the phone to her supervisor.
They scrolled through the list of passenger names and stopped at Elsie's name.
"Elsie Fleck, one vehicle and one passenger.
Ulah, I'd wager," Lang said, her attention suddenly veering to her placed call.
"Captain, it's Lang, we have some new developments that blow the case wide open."
The woman clerk hung up her phone.
"The Operation Supervisor says we can delay for a few minutes and squeeze you onto the lift if it's an important matter."
Genn looked relieved.
"Oh, it's of vital importance."
*** Elsie looked at her watch for the 3rd time in the last minute.
"What the bloodless hell is taking so long?
Can't these people ever stick to a schedule?
Excuse me!"
