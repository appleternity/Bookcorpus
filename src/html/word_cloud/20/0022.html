That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

Chapter 26.
Tony was still sitting in the same position, still clasping the same drink.
It was as if time had become stationary for him.
One second, the hologram had been standing there in front of him, and in the blink of an eye, it seemed, it had flashed away, and had returned in that same second.
He sat there without a word until the hologram asked him whether he had enjoyed the interview.
It took him several more seconds to make his brain recollect the past few minutes.
It was as though he had not wanted to be able to remember the scene.
Eventually he recalled the feeling of horror that had coursed through him when the Prime Minister had whispered, pray for us.
Lights were still burning in Downing Street as the cabinet met in another emergency session.
Time had drifted past without result, as one Minister reported failure after another.
The head of Special Branch stated that he was no nearer flushing out Mr. Walker, as he was now known, than he had been weeks before.
Finally it was the turn of the Profiler.
He stood and regarded the others with a small smile, and holding a finger to his lips to indicate silence, removed his shoes, and silently tip toed to the computer in the corner of the room, bent down and pulled the power feed plug from its socket, and ripped the modem cable from the telephone jack.
The others had watched this performance in shocked amazement.
The profiler returned to his chair, replaced his shoes, and said in a very firm voice.
"That will stop the bastard snooping on our deliberations."
The Prime Minister snapped tartly.
"What are you doing?
"  The profiler replied  "Mr Walker was using the computer to eavesdrop on us.
How was it he knew exactly what we had said at our last meeting?

Gloria thought KB was cute, while Shondra returned Kendu's glare.
"Stump ready to move on that dude, you know?"
KB told him after the girls passed them.
"I hear you.
I don't like that faggot-ass muhfucka no way.
When y'all ready to get at him, let me know, 'cause I'm down for whatever."
"Ain't that his wisdom that just walked by with that dark-skinned chick?"
KB asked.
"Yeah, that's his bitch.
I don't like her fronting ass either.
She be actin' like she all dat, and she used to be a bum-ass bitch back in the day."
"He must be getting money, 'cause they look like they just came from shopping with all dem bags they had.
Plus, she's dressed fly as fuck," KB acknowledged.
"Yeah, yeah, his trickin' ass probably is giving that ho all his money.
That's why he stressin' me for his money and shit."
"I'm saying, though, she draped in jewels and the whole nine," KB elaborated.
"Fuck that bitch, son.
She ain't nobody.
She ain't shit either, just like her punk-ass man."
When Shondra and Gloria got in her house, Shondra threw the bags on her bed and Gloria turned on the Sony radio/CD/cassette player on her dresser.
