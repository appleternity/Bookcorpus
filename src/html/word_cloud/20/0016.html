The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Social_event', 'tfidf': 3.1309502461852423, 'lexical_unit': 'party.n / banquet.n / shindig.n / fete.n / celebration.n / social.n / get-together.n / picnic.n / fair.n / reception.n / dance.n / festival.n / feast.n / dinner.n / dinner-party.n / bash.n / gala.n / jollification.n / rave.n / soiree.n / barbecue.n / ball.n / meeting.n / function.n / benefit.n', 'definition': "A Social_event occurs at which Attendees are present to conduct a social function or joint activity.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

He waved for her to go, now grinning fully at her.
They slipped down into the passageway that led below and took the steps as quickly as they could.
Slamming the door open at the bottom, Katya prayed that no one would be below.
Luck was with them, and the ground encampment was empty.
"Stop!"
someone yelled from above and Katya pumped her legs faster, pulling Gareth along behind her into the safety of the forest.
He was gasping for breath, the years he spent sitting in the old home regretting his life having caught up with his health.
She turned to help him when he suddenly went rigid.
She caught his falling body and dragged him behind the shelter of a huge tree.
"Gareth!"
she exclaimed, searching for the source of his attack.
An arrow shaft was sticking out of his back, directly behind his heart.
"Oh no..."
He coughed, "I can feel it working magic on me, I'll be gone before they get down here.
You need to go.
But Katya," he gasped and writhed in pain a moment.
"Promise me, promise me you'll go to a cave near the edge of the hunting grounds.
The one I told you about that my wife and I used to go to?"
Katya nodded, tears springing to her eyes.
"I left something there that I want you to have," he squeezed her shoulder tightly, "Please find it."

Next, send someone for the compressor, perhaps that nice Mister Panther since he seems to know about parts.
Next, I can contact the nearest cruise line and try to arrange a meeting with the appropriate person.
In the meantime, you work on putting together the best, shortest presentation you can!"
The smile Gil wore did not fully reveal the awe he felt in the prescience of his remarkable wife.
Saddled with the stress of daily living, a husband whose health was questionable and financial limitations brought on by his middle management position, she still managed to reach out and positively affect everything around her.
She was the bright beacon of his life and if he were poetic, which he definitely was not, he would have unleashed a torrent of brilliant and beautifully phrased appreciation in her general direction.
"Thank you, love," was all he could manage, but he knew she knew, his whole heart was in every word.
***
It had been a week quite unlike any other week in Gil's life.
Each night he had raced to meet Julie after work at the rubble of the ship yard, sharing dinner with the crew, learning about the garbage disposal business, working tirelessly on the presentation and then, exhausted, going home to collapse into bed and get up the next day to do it all over again.
Somehow, despite the increased work load, despite the endless hours, the new terminology, the illogical logic of the crew, the insane logic of the captain and the endless discussion of the naked lady discs, Gil felt alive.
He thought less of his heart and tubing problems, less of television preferences, less of the haunting suspicion that regardless of the can's assertions there was, in actuality, an enormous prejudice towards carrots in a can of peas and carrots.
Previously he could go on for hours on the subject, you need only look at the green to orange ratio to deduce that carrots dominated the whole peas and carrots world, but somehow, it no longer mattered.
Life had come alive!
He no longer pondered alternative uses for household pets (a team of guinea pigs pulling a vacuum had been an idea) and he no longer day dreamed of how to make popcorn an efficient weapon.
Gil Johnson had become focused!
His life, to his enormous surprise, had a point and he was pursuing it with a growing excitement that bordered on giddiness.
Sitting in bed, Gil's mind was distracted by Julie's entrance into their bedroom.
His wife vigorously rubbed lotion on her elbows, her brow wrinkled in thought.
"What do you think about giving them a gift?"
