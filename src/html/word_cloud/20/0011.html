Although there are some words that overlap between this frame and Completeness, the words in this frame indicate specifically that the magnitude of the Entity is different from what is expected, rather than grading an entity as to whether all its parts are present.  The Ranked_expectation uses must occur with an explicit or implicit quantification.  The Completeness uses can only occur with entities that have salient necessary parts and structure."}];

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"It's just a friendly lunch," I point out, knowing even as the words spill forth that there is no reason on Earth for me to justify my date with Chris.
In fact, come to think of it, I don't even know how much of the conversation Felix overheard.
Leafing through a sheaf of papers that he's swept up from the desk, he shrugs.
"I never said a word," he insists calmly.
Appearing to read, he scans the document, but it's only momentarily.
"He's a nice guy, y'know," he says, casually.
"Certainly seems to be," I agree, unsure what inflection if any to place on the sentence.
"You could do a lot worse," he adds, lifting his gaze pointedly at me.
"It's a laid back, platonic lunch," I reiterate, unsure exactly who it is I'm trying to convince of that fact.
Truthfully, I've never had the kind of butterflies in my stomach that I'm feeling now over a 'friendly' lunch.
Oh, crap.
Maybe I've made a mistake.
Perhaps I'm setting myself up for a fall with this whole thing.
"So you said," he says with a sarcastic lilt as he nods with faux gravitas.
"Felix," I grumble, walking toward him and perching my elbow on the desk.
"I've only met the guy twice, and I've only been back in town less than two weeks.
I'm not trying to kindle this year's great romance."
"Sensible," he concurs, still grinning.
"But just remember," he adds, his amusement seeming to abandon him very suddenly.
"Life doesn't quite work that way.

I'm still growing into the whole detective job thing, but I'm sure you know the game... suppose that's why a lot of detectives on the force are divorced or single... it's an occupational hazard... never know when you will be called on to do your duty... not something I would recommend for the social butterfly types.
Yeaw, I don't have a lot of friends either, but in my case I think it is more by choice than my occupation... the ones I do have are my kind of people and they understand my work... but when you come to think of it, I work with most of them in one way or another anyway... well, it's our choice huh?
That's for sure.
Why else would we be here now?
Dave smiled and gave Berry a look that said he was being sincere and Berry could tell it was in his blood... the thrill of the chase, the invigoration of the detection, the satisfaction of the catch... they were similar in those notions.
Berry let down his guard a little... maybe cooperation was a good thing after all... it appeared that they both had a lot to give that could help the other... it was appearing to Berry that it could be a win win situation, OK, I'm gonna give you some details I've left out.
Maybe between what you have and what I have we can both help each other with our work without violating any "official" rules or client confidentiality.
You gonna go first?
That's a switch... never known you to be that cooperative.
Well, I do have a client, and that client shall be nameless and left out of this if you don't mind.
Dave heaved a big sigh, tightened his lips, and slowly let out his breath... which made his cheek bulge out.
Berry smiled and chuckled.
What's so funny?
Oh, nothing, it's just that there for a minute you looked like a chipmunk ...
Berry chuckled again.
Fine way to start... with you insulting my looks!
Sorry... seriously, there are some things you should know that might help... some of the details may not fit with what you're working on, but it's my hunch that a lot of them might.
I'll give the background on what I know and you can decide where it fits... if at all.
As Berry begin to tell what he knew  Dave took the chance to bite down on his steak sandwich... he was hungry and had no problem listening to all the details while eating... he had done it a lot of times before at work...
As Berry finished filling in the blanks of what he knew, of course leaving out Gruter and how he had gotten his information, Dave's face held a rather blank expression.
