'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Ingredients', 'tfidf': 4.849990280185334, 'lexical_unit': 'ingredient.n / precursor.n / material.n / component.n / element.n / trace.n', 'definition': "A Material is used to make a Product.

In that frame, the fact that the idea is new to society is emphasized, whereas Coming_up_with refers to an agentive Cognizer using mental effort to figure something out, without any implication of the impact of the idea.

Although in both frames a Protagonist/Agent is not performing some desired action for some period of time, the use of wait.v in this frame is different from that in Holding_off_on in that Waiting prominently portrays a future event that will allow the Protagonist to proceed (with doing something), whereas Holding_off_on does not necessarily imply that there is some event or state-of-affairs that will allow the Agent to proceed, rather focussing on the action that the Agent is not yet taking.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).      "}];

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

Can't be any worse than the coffee.
Faithfully following the instructions on the side of the plastic container, Alice poured boiling water to the line and waited.
After a minute, she stirred the congealing mass with a fork.
Looks kinda plasticky she thought, before hooking out a small plasticky object.
She read the ingredients, then the instructions again: 1 - Remove sauce sachet.
Oh.
Alice slumped in the plush, blue velour cushions and flicked the remote.
Not her again.
Wonder if they found Zelda?
Ellie chirped up.
"And finally, a happy ending to one story.
The Tottyford nuns have been given the all-clear by COC, err, that's the Crustacean Observation Committee, and had their stained robes returned.
A spokesperson for the nuns said they were just delighted to get their habits back, even if they were filthy."
Alice didn't flinch.
This was an odd country, and she'd just have to get used to it.
She took a sip of tea, and spat it forcefully into the mug, spraying Will's coffee table.
What the ...?
She peered into the mixture of saliva and what looked like muddy green pond water.
It's green.
If she was going to stay here another day, she'd need to go shopping.

There was a slight click as he drew the latch, then quiet.
Arla sat there for a long moment, then she lowered her face into her hands.
* * *
Filcher's hands wouldn't stop shaking as the acolyte escorted him to the shaman's quarters.
Behind him, a pair of warriors were following, alert to any effort to escape the summons.
It was stupid; why would he have come back at all, if he was going to make a break for it now?
But with each step forward the fear grew, as his imagination began whispering all sorts of unpleasant scenarios into his mind.
Especially now, with two failures under his belt.
But in the end, he'd had nowhere else to go.
This time the acolyte didn't go in.
He paused at the outer threshold, and gestured impatiently for him to go inside.
The interior of the shaman's quarters was much as it had been on his last visit, but the back part of the room had been partitioned by a hanging curtain of black cloth, making it seem smaller and more crowded.
The bronze censer was lit, trailing a thin cloud of slightly noxious smoke through the chamber.
Filcher coughed as his eyes started to water, waving his hand in a futile effort to clear the air.
"Welcome back."
Filcher almost jumped out of his boots as Og'ok's voice startled him.
The goblin shaman materialized seemingly out of nowhere, although Filcher realized that he had to have come from behind the curtain.
There was no sign of Tog, who had been summoned an hour before him.
Had the scout gone on his way, or had he already suffered a grim fate that he would now share?
"I am not pleased at your failure," Og'ok said.
