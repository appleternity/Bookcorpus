In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.'

Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet. 
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the correct one.</span>

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't be bothered making another apology.
Another explanation of what really happened.
What's the point, right?
She doesn't want to know; she's formed her own idea of what happened, and she's sticking to it.
Shhesssh!
If I'm getting all this aggravation just because Leon collided into me in the corridor, what's it gonna be like when he asks me out?
She's gonna jump off a cliff.
Or push me off one, more like.

Jackie's right though.
Leon is interested.
He's hanging around me like I'm throwing fish out to the penguins.
You know; making out he just happens to be there, glancing my way every now and again but pretending he isn't.
If I catch him staring, he quickly averts his eyes.
Yeah, like that works!
I could give him a smile, a bit more of a come on; that's what he's expecting, isn't it?
Instead, I just give him the scowls.
It worries me a little that he can't help but think I'm in prime position for the school's 'Most Likely to End Up Living With Cats' award.

A war party gathered to conquer a mundane girl?
Get a hold of your wits, archer.
We go to cleanse the Verden village of Ballaghadaere, somewhere in the Eire, of rebel fae who thumb their nose at our laws," she said with arrogant righteousness.
"Perhaps it is best that you not hope to join, after all.
You'd be better off here on your small holdings, with your sour leprechaun friend and your delicate sensibilities."
As she began to turn away again, Vaughn said, "You'll be remindin' yer mistress that she be owin' me a scroll of flatterin' consent fer the pact she and I be makin'.
I held me end of the bargain, and now it be her turn.
She can be sendin' it along to me own lands so I won't have ta be returnin' ta hers fer it."
With a subtle nod, Dahlia said, "I will mention your wishes, but both of you be warned: she will not be pleased with what transpired here."
Vaughn frowned at her.
"The only thing that Saraid might be pleased with around here would be that big wooden dick yer holdin'.
On yer ambitious path ta glory, don't ye be thinkin' ta get on her good side; she'll not be havin' one.
Now get ye gone afore yonder bear be gettin' a hunger fer a pasty meat snack."
Dahlia eyed them both for a moment, remembering them.
S finally turned to look at the huge bear behind her.
Mix kept his menacing glare on her, but made no aggressive move.
In a circular path, Dahlia gave the beast a wide berth.
It turned to watch her as she withdrew.
Twenty paces distant of her former position, and having a better distance from the archer's lethal pet, Dahlia stopped and called to them once more.
With a cold smile, she said, "Perhaps the elements will be kind and we'll meet again under better conditions."
