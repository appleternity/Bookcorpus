'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.  E.g., in the Temperature or Location_of_light frames:  'I can never bake anything in my oven because it 's too hot.' 'She gave him a really bright flashlight for Christmas.'"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 2.8933157645428618, 'lexical_unit': 'strong.a / weak.a / mighty.a / power.n / might.n / forceful.a / force.n / strength.n / weakness.n / powerful.a / powerless.a', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

She was just someone I went out with couple of times, it was nothing," he supplied quickly, misunderstanding the purpose of the question.
Tess reached around and pulled her file with the photo towards her.
She hesitated and debated about how best to bring up the girl's demise.
This was someone he knew and no matter how he tried to downplay it, she might have been important to him.
Slowly, she put the file down and turned back to a perplexed Thom.
And surprising him, she grabbed his hands within hers.
"Thom, this morning, a body was found at an apartment complex in the city.
I'm not sure, but I think it's the same girl you were with that night," she said softly.
"What!
Are you sure?"
he exclaimed.
"No, not totally.
I'm sorry, but you're the only one I know who might be able to identify this woman.
Will you look at a crime scene photo of the girl to see if you know her?
I could be wrong and I hope that I am," she said, looking at him, trying to read his expression.
It was difficult because as an attorney, he was used to playing things close to the vest.
At his nod, she again turned and grabbed the file.
She flipped it open and handed the photo to Thom.
The black and white photo shook a little in his hands as he looked at it.
He sat for a long moment staring at the young woman in the photo before answering.

She hoped desperately she had done so successfully because she didn't want him to know she was jealous.
Rex nodded.
'And... and her mother never showed at all?' 'Nope.'
Rex paused and a frown appeared on his face.
When he frowned like that, Chelsea knew there was something bothering him.
'What Rex?' 'I don't know...
She's hiding something though.
I guess I'm sussing out possibilities.' 'Like what?' 'Has anyone ever met her mother?' 'Not that I know of...
Gee, Rex, you don't think she's living in that house on her own, do you?' 'I'm not sure.
She tried to ring her mother on her cell but got no reply.
For all I know, it might not have even been her number.
The picture on her mantelpiece intrigues me the most.
It was an old one... of her mother.'
Chelsea pondered on that revelation for a moment.
'She has a picture of her mother on her mantelpiece?
Why would she have that there if her mother was living there with her?' 'I wondered the same thing.' 'Could she really be living here in Te Arawa without parents?
Is that possible?
Surely she couldn't get away with it for long without someone realising.' 'Perhaps that's why she's so secretive about her past.'
Chelsea ran her fingers through her hair.
'Good lord, you think she may be moving from place to place hoping no one will notice?' 'It's possible, I guess.
