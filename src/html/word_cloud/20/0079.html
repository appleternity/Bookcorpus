        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

The destruction everywhere did not seem to affect Ariyah at all.
In fact, the more she saw, the more deeply she wanted to delve into it.
The medallion was vibrating calmly and that made Ariyah feel safe there.
She continued to walk the dark hallways through the direction of the beams of light let in.
Soon, Ariyah made her way to what looked like a throne room.
The marble tile was terribly cracked and broken as well as covered in tar.
There were tarnished chairs thrown all over the room and the purple carpet leading to the throne podium was scorched.
Wow...this is a palace!
Ariyah thought as she walked to the throne.
She stepped on the podium and lifted the fallen throne.
She caressed the velvet backrest, covering her palms in soot.
She looked around the room as she wondered what king used to live here and what nation of people he overseen.
As her eyes searched the room, she could see a small piece of paper caught in one of the window panes, fluttering in the wind.
She could hear Sheevar calling her from another room, but she ignored her.
Ariyah pulled one of the tarnished chairs up to the window and tried to un-jam the paper.
As she pulled at it, it ripped, causing Ariyah to fall backwards onto the dirty floor.
Recovering from the fall, she looked at the paper and saw that it was a picture.
It was a realistic painting of what looked like a king.
The man in the painting was thin, very young, maybe the age of 21, and very handsome.
He was dressed in a white suit with a gold sash across the jacket.

Rather, he'd done the decent thing and spared her further heartache.
Yet he couldn't shake the memory of her body against his, the way she'd looked at him last night.
No woman had gotten through his guard ever.
And then he thought of how he'd felt when he thought the vamps took her from his condo.
Cold fury replaced the regret, and he knew he'd do anything to keep her from danger.
The safest place she could be was with him, and he'd nearly gotten her killed by lowering his guard.
There was a reason he'd severed his connection to his emotions all those years ago.
He didn't need the distraction, but Gods, he wanted her in a way he'd never wanted anyone else!
The safest thing for both of them was for him to keep his distance and remain objective.
After all, he didn't think he'd survive the weekend.
He returned to the house to await Darian, not surprised to see Bianca's black and white cat darting down the stairs.
It slinked down the hall and slid into the narrow space of the cracked door of the library.
He almost preferred the idea of death at Czerno's hands to the mayhem his wards caused.
Reminded he didn't give Bianca the rules he gave Darian and Sofi, he retrieved his phone.
Rules of the house: 1- u don't leave w/o permission & escort; 2- obey Toni & the other Guardians when I'm out; 3- assume I'll find out, no matter what u do; 4- ask b4 u do anything or don't do it.
She grimaced as she reread the text, torn between amusement and disappointment.
Darian was right about Dusty being a dictator.
His scent still lingered on her skin, even though she'd taken a shower earlier.
He'd wanted her, but he kept his distance.
His rules made it clear she was just another of his duties.
