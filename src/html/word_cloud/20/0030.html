Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

                        <pre>
Several fraternity presidents have tried and failed to gain entry into The Circle.
So, a lot of his frat's ambition rest on his shoulders, and he has only a decent shot of getting in now, on his first try.
Even more than that, Rick was being pressured by SOAR to turnout the votes of his fraternity and the non-Greeks he can persuade for the upcoming election.
Smartly, however, Rick did his best to hide his troubles, even if the effort failed to work on some of his friends.
Rick grew elated when he saw Mike heading his way.
Mike was an example of one of those persuadable he needed to swing over to his side.
The idealist would not stop complaining about the election, suggesting that he was torn between two good friends - Richard Lowell on the Alliance ticket, and SOAR's nominee opposite Aimee Jackson, Kit Moody.
He was disgusted with the Alliance campaign tactics and even some of Alliance's unsavory elements, but struggled with the possibility of splitting his beloved Academic Council in two.
Rick crumbled the paper, and tossed it into a nearby trashcan.
After they met up, Mike offered his opinion: "Relax, being ridiculed by the Times is a ritual we all go through, and the sad thing is it might actually help you get tapped.
The Circle, as much anyone else, likes to spite the paper as much as the paper bashed them."
"That still guarantees nothing," Rick said obviously as they moved their way out of the plaza.
"Of course, but if anyone deserves to be recognized for their work in SG this year, it's you.
The Circle should recognize that."
"Too bad you don't have a vote in there," Rick pointed out as Mike turned in the direction of the student union, glancing toward the third floor of that infamous building.
"You know, Rick, there are days...
But I almost don't want to know what goes on in there more than you want to be there."
Mike pulled out his phone and checked the time.
"I gotta jet; got class in five minutes."
As he walked away, Mike remembered something.

Muslims and Hindus butchered each other and, according to the elders, rivers of blood flowed.
Any friendship between Aamir and Neelum was unthinkable, and when Neelum reached eighteen, her parents wasted no time in arranging a marriage to Vikram in Bahrain, severing contact with Aamir forever.
Tears welled as the familiar longing for her lost love threatened to overwhelm.
Unaware of her daughter-in-law's sadness Kamala untied a knot at the end of her sari and carefully counted out some money.
'Take this and buy the basmati rice and red lentils,' she said.
'Also some condensed milk and tea.
And see if that Indian mackerel fish is available.'
Without allowing Neelum time to clear away the vegetables Kamala pressed the money into her hand.
'And don't loiter, comeback quick-quick.
It's late already.'
Neelum swallowed hard.
She felt like back-answering her mother-in-law, but knew it would only make life worse.
Kamala carried tales to Vikram, and being an only son, he believed his mother rather than his wife.
If I get a job, we can find a flat of our own, she thought.
Her mother-in-law would resort to tears and drama, beg Vikram not to desert his parents in their old age but good sense would prevail, Neelum reasoned.
They would find a flat close by.
Neelum left for the cold store.
She could have passed for a Bahraini girl with her long dark plait trailing down to her waist but her distinctive shalwar kameez gave her away.
She was fair complexioned and had large brown kohl rimmed eyes.
Her tall slender frame attracted stares and sniggers from the Bahraini youths who loitered in doorways and passed their time smoking cigarettes or sometimes dope.
