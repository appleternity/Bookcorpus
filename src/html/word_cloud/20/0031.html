The directness of familial relations is also construed this way ("a close / distant cousin").

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

After squirting a good amount of sauce on the bacon and replacing the buttered bread, Bess took a bite.
It was delicious, the combination of the flavours of hot bacon, brown sauce, melted butter and bread, danced on her tongue and she enjoyed every warm mouthful.
There was nothing better in the world, especially when the weather was as nasty as it was this morning.
"Mum," Bess said after she had poured herself a cup of tea.
"I was wondering if you would like to have a look at some of the photos we got from Nan's yesterday.
There are so many pictures and I don't really know many of the people in them.
It would be nice to find out who they all are."
"Of course.
I'm not sure I'll be any help though, but I can have a look with you later.
I have some ironing to do, so after I've cleared this lot away and the roast beef is in the oven we can sit down together for a while."
Bess finished her cup of tea and went back upstairs to her room.
She picked up the photo again and took another look at it.
There was no doubt in her mind, she had definitely seen him or someone who looked exactly like him near the old school.
Carefully she went through all of the photos to see if she could spot the same boy in any more of them, but there was only the one picture.
After dressing, Bess picked out a few snaps of random family members she didn't know.
She checked the backs of the photos to see if names were written on them, but there was nothing to indicate who they were.
A few had dates on, but apart from that, the only picture which had a name on the back was the picture of the boy called Philip.
Shivering at the thought of seeing someone who could only be described as a ghost, Bess wondered if she should tell Tom about seeing the boy.
Would he think she was nuts?
Or, would the thought of seeing a boy from a different time scare him.

The horny toads had gotten up when the girls did and they went outside to settle themselves down in a spot where the rising sun was hitting and warming the rocks.
The girls decided to try and use the power they had with the orbs to make breakfast.
It took a few tries and a number of broken eggs before they got the hang of it and that was only after Pill got an idea as to what to do..
"Maybe we're thinking too fast.
I mean, I don't know about you.
But I think I want an egg in the skillet and then 'zoom' the egg goes crashing into the skillet and the wall.
Maybe if I think of moving the egg slowly then that would make the egg move slower," Pill suggested.
She gave it a try and sure enough it worked.
They started to think in slow motion terms after that.
"You know, I really wished that these orbs were more like Tally had said, about being pocket sized.
They would be a heck of a lot easier to manage," Pill told Lark.
And as if the orb was listening to Pill it began to shrink down until it fit snuggly into the palm of her hand.
Lark, impressed with what Pill had done immediately thought the same thing and her orb also shrank down to palm size.
"Neato!"
Pill exclaimed, "I wonder what else we can do?"
They spent the rest of time they had while the others slept trying out different things.
By the time the  adults had gotten up the breakfast was ready, the ship had been loaded with all the gold it could hold and the rest of the gold had been buried in a very neat and deep hole dug out by the orbs power.
No one had noticed that the gold was gone or that the ship's wheels were sagging a little.
They all just sat there quietly eating and enjoying their breakfast.
Tally was having his breakfast in the hide out's entrance.
