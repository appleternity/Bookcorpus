Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Val felt himself blush.
"Sure.
I mean, are you serious?"
"Just because I matched the good professor stein for stein, while you, and I do appreciate it, did your civic duty by abstaining, does not mean that I have lost my ability to reason!
I repeat: where to?"
"Well, let's see.
If we eliminate for the sake of argument the 90% of campus joints that feature either burgers, pizza or some combination, we're still left with a number of places that have an intellectual bent."
"Can't we just go dancing?
And what's wrong with burgers and pizza, not that I'm hungry?
I tell you what.
We're near the hotel, right?
Why don't we go there, check in, and take a cab back here to High Street?"
Val ran a yellow, smiling to himself and shaking his head.
Chapter 27 Val had made the three-hour drive home to Toledo from Columbus dozens of times in college.
As usual he hadn't really planned to visit his mother but for some reason felt like taking advantage of being in Ohio.
He decided he could spare the time, so he dropped Jenny at the airport and headed north.
He had only a small headache, appropriate for the more than one but less than I forget how many beers he had drunk.
On any given afternoon between three and four he was at significant risk of falling asleep at the wheel - or in the conference room - but he figured he'd be OK after three coffees.
He could nap on his mom's couch.
She had converted his room into a combination office and sewing room.

"I inherit the powers of the slain, Amon," Cadmus interrupted, getting impatient with the demon.
The raven's head twitched at the statement and he stared hard into the reaper's grey eyes.
Amon walked forward until he was within a few feet of the Horseman and almost seemed to smile.
"How interesting...I did not know that, reaper.
Are you implying you have inherited the future sight?"
he asked, but Cadmus shook his head at that.
"No, Amon, but in a flash I was able to see the future, or at least what Raum had seen in his visions."
"And what did you see?"
Amon asked, inching closer to the reaper.
"I...that's not what we need to ask about."
"Tut, tut, Horseman, this game will not be so one-sided," Amon stated, just slightly baring his wolf's teeth.
"First," Cadmus said, backing away and bringing his scythe in front of him, trying to ward off the raven's aggressive behavior.
"First I need to know how to interpret it."
"You should tell me what it was, Horseman," the demon's head twitched as it made the suggestion, but Cadmus shook his head.
"Would it be reliable, Amon?
Anything I saw?
Or could it just be something that Raum wanted to happen?
Could it just be some demented fantasy?
Would it be reliable even if it was just a vision?"
Cadmus asked, keeping his gaze fixed on the black eyes of the demon.
