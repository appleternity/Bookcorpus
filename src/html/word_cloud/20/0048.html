Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.

For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Creating', 'tfidf': 2.802112518249764, 'lexical_unit': 'create.v / form.v / assemble.v / produce.v / production.n / formation.n / generate.v / yield.v / issue.v / issuance.n / make.v', 'definition': "A Cause leads to the formation of a Created_entity.

Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

"Are you okay," John asked as he carefully removed the knife from the note and picked it up.
"Yes I'm okay," Sam stated.
"I think I know who he is, John."
"Who?"
John asked as he whistled for his companions to join them.
"William Jeffery a.k.a. Lyle Douglas," she retorted.
"How do you know that?"
John asked irritated.
"Because he asked if I knew who had killed Bill Slade," Sam answered.
"And that makes you think he is Douglas," John remarked.
"Sam that's stupid."
"Read the note John," Sam interjected.
John opened the note and read; "Samantha Marlow you are very much like your father and I respect that.
Meet me at the burned remains of Shady Acres at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.
Come alone.

Sam looked at him and laughed, "Since when do you have the right to forbid me to do anything, John Chambers.
