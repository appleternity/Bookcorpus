That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}, {'frame': 'Political_locales', 'tfidf': 2.1297389047886948, 'lexical_unit': 'barony.n / territory.n / country.n / province.n / duchy.n / viscountcy.n / county.n / state [sovereign].n / principality.n / borough.n / town.n / realm.n / kingdom.n / municipality.n / metropolis.n / megalopolis.n / city.n / world.n / federal.a / global.a / parish.n / diocese.n / international.a / local.a / locality.n / municipal.a / national.a / empire.n / village.n / nation.n / commonwealth.n / internationally.adv / multinational.a / city-state.n / district.n / fiefdom.n / jurisdiction.n / land.n / state [internal].n / provincial.a / territorial.a / township.n', 'definition': "This frame covers words that name Locations as defined politically, or administratively.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

As he stands there, feeling her wrenching sobs in his own heart, Tristian becomes more determined than ever to get her back to them.
Even though now, he wants her to stay.
When the tears finally stop, Zoe looks around at the pixie's faces; it's hard to miss the sorrow they hold in their eyes for her.
She sits back down, wrapping her arms around her knees and putting her chin on her hands.
She sits there and waits with the pixies until Garrett and the others go to sleep, with Fionna at her side.
They all are listening to the same sounds, crickets and frogs, but somehow it just doesn't have the same effect for everyone.
To Zoe, they just sound lonely.
Even the twinkling of the stars seem pale to her now.
CHAPTER EIGHT
When the camp quiets and the pixies are sure they are all asleep, they make their decent into the camp.
Tristian takes Zoe as he flies down to land on the table.
Things look completely different when you are this size, Zoe thought, now knowing how the pixies feel.
The heat from the campfire is hot, almost scorching her as they fly past.
Tristian lets her go and she wanders aimlessly around, looking at all the things they brought with them with a look of deep sadness and longing.
Tristian knows what it's like to miss someone; the feeling seems to envelope your very soul.
The sadness in her eyes makes his need to make this all right even more urgent.
Leaning against the coffee pot crossing his arms over his chest, Tristian just watches Zoe.
Looking around the equipment, Zoe realizes that they each have their own memories.
The first time the gang went camping, they brought all of this canned food with them.
As soon as it got too late to do anything about it, they start looking for the can opener and can't find it.

The Royal robes dissolving and pink fleshy skin dissolving into pale translucence.
They each held ice staffs in their hands, pointed at the real Royal family.
The Ice King chuckled, "Princess, I'm so glad you could join us.
Honestly we couldn't have done this without you.
Try as we might, we could never find that stone in the Godmother's house.
But you found it and we are so very grateful."
The Ice Queen sneered, "And now the one thing that could stop us is here."
Annabeth cried out, "Why are you doing this?
What did we ever do to you?"
The Ice Queen was taken aback, "Do?
DO?
You and your people have done enough.
They exiled my people to the far north and made sure that nothing could survive there.
So my people died; starved and cut off from the world.
You all should pay for what you've done.
Now, we will begin a new age of ice and snow, filling this world with eternal cold."
The Real King spoke, "I am sorry for what my ancestors did.
I cannot change their actions, but I beseech you now, end this madness.
We can reach some agreement."
The Ice King spat out, "There is nothing you could offer us.
