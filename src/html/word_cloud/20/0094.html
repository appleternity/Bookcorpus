For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Locale', 'tfidf': 2.332419307510106, 'lexical_unit': 'area.n / zone.n / region.n / place.n / spot.n / location.n / locale.n / pocket.n / regional.a / site.n / point.n / grounds.n / earth.n', 'definition': "This frame contains general locale words, and is mostly a place-holder in the hierarchy.

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

The caravan was dumped in a corner of the yard, but there was no sign of Matthew with Chip.
"They want to know where they can stay, Mum.
There's nowhere around I can think of."
Mrs. Collins frowned.
"Mrs.
Myers down at the farm might help if it's only for a night or two.
She sometimes takes in visitors."
Anna tried to sound casual as she emptied one of the jugs of now-cold tea into the large sink.
The tea bags fell out with a thud.
"It's a shame, really, that we don't do bed-and-breakfast here at the cafe."
She looked up out of the corner of her eye to see her mother's reaction.
"Love you, Anna, where would we ever put people up?
The bungalow's only large enough for the two of us, and we could hardly sleep people in the cafe -- unless they slept on the tables!"
"Or under them!"
Anna added with a smile, but her heart had sunk deeper than her mother could ever know.
It had seemed such a wonderful idea at the time.
She knew that if this was her own place she'd do everything possible to help this family for the night.
She'd give up her own bed if necessary.
But she knew her mother was right.
There just wasn't enough room for anyone else to stay, and it would surely be unhygienic to have people sleeping in the cafe, and probably against some sort of law.

The intoxicating scent of wood-smoke filled the atmosphere as they lounged by the campfires on the banks of the scenic Dankole.
If Al Mancini could find food and shelter he ought to survive somehow, and Casilevatates wished him well, having no animosity toward the man, her former lover, though she thought he played the martyr card with a little too much self-pity.
She dared not express any sentiments saying she was glad Al had escaped when Commander Seraphinaria was listening, or for that matter when Mirabrasantes, Navorrasicaa, Misevasundia and Sevaladelia were listening, as these warriors and former lovers of Al Mancini were the ones most likely to get violent toward anyone they suspected of urging or helping Al to escape.
Valmyristarsis had announced not many minutes ago  that she was glad to see Al gone, and she went on to add that she didn't think his brains were anything special.
She walked right into the meat-grinder with that comment because Misevasundia was quick on the attack: `No woman with any brains cares if a pleasure-slave is brainy or not.
All that matters is a few things things : Is he attractive?
Does he have some charm?
Is he fun to be around?'
To which Valmyristarsis responded with the standard line / running joke they all used whenever they felt themselves seriously insulted: `I'll just bide my time and then I'll cut your throat, bitch, when you're not expecting it.'
Seraphinaria was actually not bad at keeping discipline among her ranks.
She encouraged her girls to speak freely and honestly, but to try to be as diplomatic as possible, and to use the running joke if they absolutely had to vent any rage welling up inside themselves because of any real or perceived insults.
She wanted the wrath vented through words not sword thrusts.
So far no one's throat had been cut, and perhaps it would have been impossible for any commander to keep such willful warrior women from clawing each other some.
When you enter a shark tank you're lucky if you can get out with just a few long gashes and deep wounds.
But Seraphinaria's girls were much more civilized than sharks!
It's just that they got bored easily, and morale was always better when tall dark and handsome men were available for them to cuddle up with on the cold winter evenings.
Casilevatates was still twiddling her thumbs while sitting on the bank of the Dankole River, the narrow but deep inundation which she and the others must cross eventually.
Casilevatates looked on, while, not far from her, also on the banks of the river, Seraphinaria was slowly pronouncing some words to help her 3-year-old son, Jay-Jay, learn them: `No more MAN-see-nee.
MAN-see-nee go bye-bye.
He gone.
