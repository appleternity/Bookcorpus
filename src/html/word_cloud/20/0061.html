'The grill, unsecured, rolled a few feet across the yard.'  'The swarm went away to the end of the hall.'  The frames that inherit the general Motion frame add some elaboration to this simple idea.  Inheriting frames can add Goal-profiling (arrive, reach), Source-profiling (leave, depart), or Path-profiling (traverse, cross), or aspects of the manner of motion (run, jog) or assumptions about the shape-properties, etc., of any of the places involved (insert, extract). A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'  This last type is annotated in the simple Motion frame."}, {'frame': 'Give_impression', 'tfidf': 1.6760341505464744, 'lexical_unit': 'appear.v / feel.v / look.v / reek.v / seem.v / smell.v / sound.v / stink.v / taste.v', 'definition': "In this class of perception words, a Phenomenon, typically expressed as External Argument, and its perceptual characteristics are given some description.

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Accompaniment', 'tfidf': 1.138284345731495, 'lexical_unit': 'with.prep / along with.prep / singly.adv / alone.a / in combination.prep / together.adv', 'definition': "A Co_participant fills the same role as the Participant in an event or relation.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"We cannot wear their garb anyway, no one would believe that either of us is Minoan, my skin is to dark and yours to light."
"So what do we do?"
"I am sure there are people from the Black Land here, we will use subterfuge to gain their confidence," I said.
"Black Land?"
"Oh... sorry I mean ancient Egypt."
"No, Black Land is good," Shelley replied.
We hid ourselves for the rest of the day until night fell, we built a small smokeless fire to make our now stale bread a bit more palatable.
I snuck into the sea and caught a few fish with my hands.
I felt a wave of nostalgia when I realized it had been many years since I had practised my original trade.
I was not as agile as I had been as a young child but a fish would still be wise to fear me.
"Wow Kem you swim like a dolphin," Shelley had a look of admiration on her face.
I smiled as I threw the still wiggling fish onto the ground.
I had not been any more than an average swimmer in my village.
I showed Shelley how to make a stone knife out of a piece of obsidian we found, we used it to clean the fish before we cooked them.
They tasted impossibly good.
It was soon night, I used the stone knife to shred our clothes and then stained them with dirt.
"We will tell them we were shipwrecked," I said to Shelley.
We stealthily crept into the city, the streets were dark illuminated only by the lamplight shining from the building windows.
I strained my ears until I heard the sound I was searching for.
I grabbed Shelley's hand and quickly walked towards its source.

It wasn't until I rescued John from the bogeyman that he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend.
Why did I agree?
Like most mermaids, I'm naturally curious.
I've always wondered what it would be like to be in love, what it would be like to have someone in love with me.
Most supernaturals aren't capable of loving someone else.
We're driven by our baser instincts.
Fear.
Lust.
Hunger.
Greed.
Compassion, empathy, love, are feelings we don't seem capable of experiencing.
So it wasn't like I was going to fall in love with someone.
To experience love, romantic love, I needed someone to fall in love with me.
That's why I didn't want to screw up my relationship with John, and why I was on my best behavior.
Unfortunately, life, or God, or fate, or whatever you want to call it, likes to screw with me.
This time that screwing came in the form of a supernatural I call Elvis vamp.
I was having dinner with John and a couple of his friends, a husband and wife named Mark and Rachel.
Maybe friends isn't the right word.
Mark was John's new boss.
John holds a doctorate in marine biology and Mark was in charge of the marine biology department at one of the local colleges.
