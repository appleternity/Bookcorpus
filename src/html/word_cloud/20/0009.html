This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}];

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.

                        <pre>
All of these I have experienced at times, but the last one happens to me especially when around books.
Sometimes I have had books on my shelves for months or even years and never felt that I wanted to read them, not really knowing why I bought them.
Suddenly one day the title will stand out from all the others and I will pick up the book and sometimes read it in a day and relate to the message it has for me in its pages.
This never ceases to amaze me.
It certainly fits the saying 'When the student is ready, then the teacher will appear' and at times these books are my teachers.
I have found wisdom and depth of understanding through allowing myself to be 'directed' towards the reading of certain books: they have enabled me not only to grow but also to pass knowledge on to others that I have met along the way.
I have not always felt this way.
It has taken me a large part of my life to trust what I feel, trust the conversations I have with myself and trust the knowledge I have about a situation before it happens, but trust I do.
I never get every detail right but I will say that my sense, my intuition has prepared me many times for situations I have found myself in.
When I didn't listen in the early years and ignored my inner guidance, things became difficult at times.
It is your intuition that could help you understand the lessons that are being presented to you in your life experiences.
Since I now acknowledge my inner voice I have to say my life has become more joyous because I have agreed to trust and listen.
I have developed my intuition, the ability to have a knowing within and I have faith in this and believe that it is spiritual and comes from the universe or from God.
It depends which one you feel more comfortable in adopting.
For me, it comes from God and my spirit family but it doesn't matter where you think it comes from, as long as you listen.
It cannot, however, stand alone: it can guide you and give you support but ultimately it is you who makes the final decision.
None of us are perfect and we will make mistakes.
Your intuition can support your life path but it does not control you: it can give you only guidance, if you let it, for the final decisions about who you are, where you will go and who you will become are yours.
In my understanding and experience, listening to your intuition offers you guidance so that you can experience fully the life you have been given here on Earth.
When you have awareness of self you can begin to understand your impact on others, both those you know and those you have not met yet.

From the smile I felt like I was the first person to ever tell her.
She walked slowly over to me, placing her tiny hands on my chest.
Her scent was starting things off again.
We didn't have time to deal with my arousal.
"You look mighty handsome, Ryder" she whispered.
I swallowed hard, her speaking in that voice didn't exactly help my situation.
I grabbed hold of her hand and dragged her out of my room, hoping Jo was in the living room.
It was empty, I looked at Tess shocked.
"They left when I got here," she was looking down at the floor.
"I'm getting the feeling you don't want to be alone with me."
The shock hit me.
She could read me really well.
"No!"
I shook my head and our eyes met, I now felt very embarrassed.
"It's just," I raised an eyebrow and took in another glance of Tess in that dress.
"Your dress" I pointed.
"It's doing things to my body and I haven't got time to deal with the problem."
She started fluttering her eyelashes and her hands started running up and down my chest.
The blood started to pump south and the indiscreet thoughts filled my mind.
I stood up, just to find some air to breathe again.
