'' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Charlie laughed a bit to himself in his head at that last bit of thought as he continued on his way past the staircases, eying staircase 3 on his left.
Indeed, all of the staircases were in numerical order.
He made his way over to staircase 3 and stopped at the bottom stair.
He took a deep breath then began to climb.
Up the stairs Charlie climbed.
He eventually could see staircases 4, 5, 6 and 7 in the distance.
Staircase 7, he thought.
If anything goes wrong here I'll make my way over there as quickly as possible.
Hopefully it will bring the best of luck.
He eventually reached the top of staircase 3.
Before the cloud of smoke was what appeared to be the top stair stretching toward the wall at the other end.
As he inched closer to the wall he began to see a little beyond the smoke what was a strange text on the wall.
The smoke began to clear.
As soon as it was gone Charlie could clearly make out the bloody writing.
It was some sort of chant.
He read it aloud:                                                                                                       "SPIRITS OF THE AIR              YOUR TIME HAS ARRIVED                WITH A POISON SO RARE       YOU WILL RETURN TO YOUR LIVES"
With a poison so rare?
He thought.
What does that mean?
Without warning a heavy breeze then knocked Charlie out of balance.

He wanted her to kiss Rafe.
She could tell by that same intense look of interest he'd displayed when he'd caught her kissing Dan.
Dan watched her keenly.
She gazed at Rafe.
His expectant smile created some wonderful trembles inside her lower belly.
Suddenly, the idea of kissing Rafe in front of the other two men was a real turn-on.
She stood and Brady and Dan cheered.
"Oh, Rafe!
Looks as if you are gonna get your kiss," Dan said with a grin.
Arousal flared in his green eyes.
Brady settled back in his chair and folded his arms casually across his chest.
His blue eyes were dark and intense as he studied her.
Heat swirled low in her belly.
"It's because she's saved the best for last," Rafe replied with a wink.
JJ's heart hammered crazily as she walked around her chair and stood in front of Rafe.
His brown eyes dilated with sexual hunger.
Something lusty whipped through her.
Her breathing quickened and hot blood coursed through her veins.
Suddenly, he reached out and grabbed her around the waist.
She let out a yelp as he pulled her onto his lap.
