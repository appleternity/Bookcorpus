        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

                        <h5>(An excerpt from the book <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Sherwood"</span>.)</h5>
                        <br/>
                        <pre>
Sir Robert looked wide-eyed down at the yard of steel in his stomach and Sir Guy slowly rose to his feet, slowly pulling the sword out as he stood.
Sir Robert's legs gave out and now it was him, not Gisbourn, on his knees in the wet grass.
The baron's already red blade swept up, down and into Sir Robert's left shoulder whit a meaty 'thud', followed by the 'snap' of breaking bone.
This time the mail shirt held, but the force of the blow had crushed the shoulder and broke the older knight's neck instantly.
Sir Robert Locksley, born over half a century earlier to an unknown father and a young, unwed princess who gave him away at birth, was dead.
Twenty years after his birth, that same princess, by then the new wife of Richard I of England, had unwittingly taken her cast off child, now a handsome young northern lord, as a lover.
From that brief, ill-fated union of Sir Robert of Locksley and Eleanor of Aquitaine had come a yet another unwanted babe; a boy child born of incest, innocence and foolish folly --- a child soon handed over by Sir Robert to his bowmaker and forester, Thomas Bowman and his good wife, to raise as their own son in a small cottage on the edge of Sherwood Forest.
Sir Robert, the seventh Lord of Locksley Hall, was now dead, but his unclaimed, unaware bastard son still lived.
Robin now stood on the abbey roof, longbow in hand, looking down on the man that had already killed Thomas Bowman, the only father he knew and had now just slain Sir Robert, his real father that he still was unaware of.
And so the tangle that was our lives took on yet another twist as the following tragedy unfolded.
Sir Guy yanked his sword free of Sir Robert's neck, booted the body aside, pointed the blood slick blade at Marian and yelled: "Kill them all, but bring me the girl NOW!"
The sheriff was the only one who did not surge forward.
Instead Sir Gaston followed his uncle to their horses.
Once mounted, both men watched Hurcule Beaumont set about to earn his pay.
Sir Hurcule, his dagger now replaced by his gleaming sword, led the men-at-arms directly at Little John, Marian and myself.
She and I both had our knives out and John his staff ready when the fist two arrows struck.
The first one hit Sir Hurcule squarely in his breastplate and bounced off while the second arrow took a man-of- arms in the mouth.
High pitched screaming began then and everywhere was movement and flashing blades.
More arrows zipped by, close enough to feel their breeze as they passed.
John had cracked open one skull and was beating down a second soldier.

What he saw had him bolting like a bandit up the dock, dodging cargo and men on his race to reach Kael.
Kael reached her in a matter of seconds, wrapping his long arms around her petite frame and his heart sighed at the feel of her.
His thoughts raced and he was speechless, but he knew for a fact that this was not a dream.
Her eyes widened in surprise, her muscles stiffened in fear and she tried to pull away, but Kael's hold only tightened.
Her arms remained pinned to her sides and she struggled against his grasp before she managed a small cry for help.
Carr arrived and grabbed her by the waist which yielded another cry of surprise.
"Get..."
she tried to yell.
Kael released her at once, suddenly overcome with an enormous sense of deja vu.
Something was wrong, she shouldn't be acting like this.
He stepped back and seized Carr by the arm, dragging him away as he examined the woman's face.
It held the familiarity of his own, but at the same time was different.
It was Prea; he would know her anywhere and this was her.
But a new scar was visible; fresh and pink, it extended from the edge of her left eyebrow down past her cheekbone before trailing off by her ear.
Worst of all, she was looking at him with fear in her eyes - fear, shock and confusion.
His stomach rolled over and his heart constricted with the realization that she didn't know them.
Carr was attempting to break free as he reached for his sister.
"Prea, it's me.
It's Carr," he exclaimed.
"What's wrong?
