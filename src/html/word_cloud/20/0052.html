Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

Cradossk growled cocking his head on the other side of the canyon.
"You started it."
Aurra glared at the Trandoshan and raised her macrobinoculars to look at the outskirts of Mos Espa.
"This should better be worth my time.
I still have business elsewhere."
Jango muttered as he placed his helmet back on his head and scanned the horizon.
"Then be elsewhere."
Aurra glared at the dark visor.
Jango Fett seemed to appear more threatening and loomed before her without moving but the hybrid wasn't fazed at all and met that unseen gaze with her own defiant orbs.
Cradossk snorted at the two and placed his hand over his eyes to cover the glare of the sun and look ahead, he doesn't need the macrobinoculars and the built-in zoom-in viewfinder in Fett's helmet.
His keen reptilian eyes are still exceptional despite his age.
Ahead of them in the far distance were the largest herds of Banthas he had ever seen gathering in one place.
"Must be the season."
Jango commented, turning away from Aurra Sing to look across the desert.
"Are you sure the Queen will be there?"
Cradossk asked.
"The Viceroy's spy informed him they're headed off here to make repairs.
Mos Espa is the only inhabited region on the side of Tatooine facing the exit vector of any ship coming from the Chommell Sector.
This is the only logical place to await them."
Aurra Sing explained.

Fucking Giles Corcoran.
I've had his speech time and time again, the good foot soldier, the good cop, blah blah fucking blah.
It'll never change, unless I make it change.
But I haven't heard him talk about O'Brien in this way before, and though there's nothing I can do with it, here's a man on the edge.
What the fuck has happened to Munster?
I'll beat him black and blue when I eventually get my hands on him.
The wind screeches outside as it always does when the night takes over fully.
Its sound, bleak and harsh, cuts through me like it always does, reminds me of the first few nights and the confusion and horror of those times, and the sorrow, emptiness and loneliness that filled the void afterwards, that still fills it now and refuses to let go.
I think of Giles, literally sitting on my memories, and a shiver of revulsion goes through me.
For a moment I consider stepping back out into the night, searching for some company on the desolate streets, but the risk of waking Giles is too much and I don't want to tempt myself into doing something stupid, and so I lie on the bed, close my eyes and wait for morning, hoping that I've drunk enough to banish the dreams for another night.
Chapter 16.
Carver stands alone.
He's itching to leave here, he doesn't like this place and he doesn't like these people, but he's made a commitment and he's going to see it through.
For the third or fourth time he pulls the sheet of paper out and looks through it, just to do something on this intensely cold morning.
You have to come here very early, to minimise the risk of getting caught by something, but you have to contend with the icy winds and frost that own the dawn.
Carver's hands are covered with rags, wound tightly around them, but still his fingers feel like they're bleeding as he does something, anything with them to keep warm.
Again, he looks at the small shack, imagining the tiny shreds of warmth he may be able to get in there, and he stamps his feet once more to fight off the cold.
He steps over to the shack and bangs again on its corrugated metal door.
There's are a few noises inside, eventually a woman's voice, high and shrill, can be heard.
"What do you want?"
