We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.

Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}, {'frame': 'Process_continue', 'tfidf': 1.9828175743019574, 'lexical_unit': 'continue.v / ongoing.a / persist.v / drag on.v / go on.v / persistence.n / proceed.v / underway.a / on.adv', 'definition': "An Event continues at a certain Place through Time.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

She found herself, after what had been an unknowable length of time, still in Jackie's arms, her tears still moist rivers on her cheeks.
She smiled.
"Jacks," she whispered.
"Yes?"
"I went back to it all, and I'm still here."
"I'm not sure what you mean.
You're certainly still here."
"I've been back to the time, to those months.
I've just relived them as much as I ever could.
And I'm still here."
Katherine sat up slowly from her resting position and turned to look at her friend.
"The memories just came after me, Jacks," she said.
"They came to swallow me up and I let them.
Only ...
I'm still here."
"You mean you hadn't allowed yourself to make peace with your time with Stanley?
Ever?"
"Jacks, I just didn't let you in at the time, I didn't let myself in.
I just closed the door.
It was all too painful.

He let the guards cuff him and went quietly down the hallway.
Solitary confinement as punishment made no sense to Dirk since they were kept alone most of the time anyway, but when the guards opened the door, he finally understood.
The cell was maybe a quarter of the size of the one he now called home; there was nothing to sit on, and no room to sit.
They left him cuffed and slammed the door.
The guard had said one hour, but it easily felt like twice that had passed before the men returned and walked him back to his cell.
The floor was clean and nothing else appeared to have been touched, so Dirk grabbed his book from under his cot and settled in for the afternoon.
At dinner time, Dirk found Soren once again standing at the bars of his cell door with a meal tray, and once again that tray wound up face down on the floor.
He spent another hour in solitary and the rest of the evening trying to ignore the grumbling in his stomach.
For days Soren returned at every meal, dumping the tray on the floor while purring empty condolences and taunting him with news about his family.
The visits to solitary were wearing on his nerves and his stomach was twisting in tight and painful knots.
During rec periods he paced, stretching his legs.
Alone in his cell he read, stretching his mind.
Sometimes in solitary he would talk to himself, out loud, about the last few chapters he had read.
The sound of a human voice was comforting, even if the tight space did give it an eerie quality.
The only comfort he received was from the female guard.
He'd learned her name was Hanri, though the male guards who came to take him to solitary confinement called her Henry and then chuckled as if the juvenile name-calling was still funny.
She frowned every time she found his tray upside down, but she seemed to know what had happened, and though she couldn't stop them from putting him in that tiny cell she didn't yell at him or raise hell about it either.
They didn't often exchange words.
She didn't open his door unless she had to, and she didn't speak to him if there were other guards around.
After the fifth missed meal, she had said, "He doesn't stick with one prisoner for very long.
