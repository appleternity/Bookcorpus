These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Spatial_co-location', 'tfidf': 1.0719121532686189, 'lexical_unit': 'at.prep / where [relativizer].adv / here.adv / there.adv / where [interrog].adv / home.adv', 'definition': 'A Figure is located essentially at the same location as a Ground, which is viewed as point-like, or having no important internal or external structure.  Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}, {'frame': 'Expected_location_of_person', 'tfidf': 1.0574132402267928, 'lexical_unit': 'in.prep / out.prep / home.n', 'definition': "A Person usually resides or works in a Location.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Shardstorm had copied the STPOW's design for them.
I fumed as I watched Asher check his message and hesitantly say, "Sir, another Leaguer has quit."
"Not now, you fool!"
Shardstorm hissed under his breath.
But Agent River perked up, smelling blood.
"Is there'd something you'd like to tell us, Shardstorm?"
"Most of his Leaguers aren't as loyal as I am!"
Darkblaze told us proudly.
"Almost all of them quit after seeing his plans get ruined twice.
But I will stay with him forever!"
Shardstorm's fury threatened to boil over.
His dark blue eyes narrowed.
"And who gave you permission to reveal that sensitive information?"
he said, his voice dangerously soft.
Darkblaze looked afraid for the first time in my memory.
Not afraid of us, not of the STPOW, not even of the threat of death, but of her master.
And suddenly I realized that if we ever made it out of this, it wouldn't be as hard to remove most of Shardstorm's supporters as we might have thought.
"Now!
Enough of this!"
Shardstorm growled, pulling out a stun gun.

Nasty was the word that came to mind when he glanced around the inn and toward the common room.
Some tables had yet to be cleared of the remnants of the noon meal though it had been over for many hours.
Smoke from the kitchen created an unpleasant haze that only heightened James distaste.
A skinny man of average height with greasy black hair spied him standing in the foyer.
Wiping his hands on an apron that quite possibly had never been washed, he crossed over to greet him.
"Need a room?"
he asked, and James could almost see the green, putrefied odor coming from the man as he talked.
James turned his head slightly to try to get away from the sickening smell.
"No," he quickly replied while he tried not to breathe.
"Just seeing if my friend was here," he lied.
"Thanks though."
He made a hasty exit through the front door, and took a deep breath once outside.
He informed Miko that they would not be staying there that night.
"What was wrong with it?"
Getting back on his horse he replied, "It was filthy and nasty.
The one person I saw stank and I fear he may have been the cook."
The thought of eating anything produced in a place of such disregard for cleanliness made him slightly sick.
"I'm sure there are others here, it's a fair sized town," commented Miko.
"I certainly hope so.
I'll sleep under the stars again before I stay in a place like that."
