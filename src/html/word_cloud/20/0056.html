In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category ("something of a klutz"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition ("I, like, waved it around").

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

he sang out.
High fives went up all over the place.
"Now we're getting somewhere."
Courtney asked him, "Are you trying to get your parents to buy you a pet?"
Everyone stopped laughing and looked at her.
"No," he said.
"I just figured that's a good idea for a science project is all."
He smirked at Tyrone and Clarence.
"Well, if you think your parents are going to let you have bugs as pets, you're crazy."
Courtney explained.
"You know how much money it costs to have an exterminator come every year?
And all those pesticides the city puts in trees?"
She looked at him even harder.
"You can't start a bug farm here.
This is a residential area."
Clarence glared at Courtney and whispered something to the others.
They all had weird looks on their faces.
Tanya leaned over.
"What are they whispering about?"
she whispered.

A dour maid squired the pair through the lavish interior of the Greavy home and as she viewed the opulent and tasteful trappings, Mary could not help but think that in the final summation, even Thomas' considerable fortune could not insulate him from harsh and ugly side of life.
Isobel Greavy awaited the pair's arrival in a drawing room that was roughly the size of Mary Langdon's entire flat.
Mary's first impression of the woman was one of instant admiration.
Tall and eerily beautiful in the manner of Cassande Verhoeven, there was absolutely nothing self-deprecating about Isobel.
She exuded the supreme confidence of a woman who is distinctly aware of her place and value in the world and who is certain that she is fully entitled to everything life has bestowed upon her.
Hers was a regal bearing and poise that would make even Queen Katherine seem dowdy by comparison.
Attired in a conservative black dress, the blond-haired widow was the very quintessence of grieving nobility...something from England's lost grand age.
Isobel did not rise to greet the two inspectors, instead gesturing them into identical floral pattern wing backs near the hearth of the large fireplace that dominated the north wall of the room.
"Would either of you care for tea?"
she inquired in a rich erudite voice that reminded Mary of expensive silk.
When both inspectors declined, Isobel inclined her head and the maid quickly departed, though not before giving the pair a rather puzzling frown of disapproval.
Isobel noticed the look and when the maid closed the door, she remarked, "You will have to excuse Esther...she regards me as a particularly delicate piece of porcelain and is fiercely protective.
Now, is this simply to be an information gathering affair...or do you have something tangible to bring me?"
Donald glanced briefly at Mary, who did not envy his position as lead on this interview, and then began, "Mrs. Greavy, I want to begin by expressing our deepest condolences for you tragic loss and I can assure you that this investigation will bring every resource available to bear in the effort to find the person who committed this unspeakable crime."
Isobel Greavy tilted her head slightly in acknowledgement of his expression of sympathy and her hazel eyes settled briefly on Mary.
Mary's gaze shifted quickly to Isobel's long fingers, which rested lightly on the arms of her chair.
Even her posture spoke of a woman whose grip on composure was literally unflappable, but Mary had little doubt that this facade was brittle and the right careless remark could cause it to crumble, revealing the turbulent vortex of her pain and grief.
"Thank you inspector...and I can insure you that all resources will indeed be committed to finding the monster that did this to my husband.
I am correct in assuming that the extensive web of surveillance cameras on the green did not capture what transpired the other night?"
The not so subtle implication was clear to both inspectors...Isobel Greavy possessed the requisite clout to insure that the Yard was diligent in pursuing her husband's murderer.
