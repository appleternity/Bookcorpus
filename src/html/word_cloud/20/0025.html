        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

The woman stood a moment, stunned.
Before turning, and following the car along the drive it had just entered, calling, 'Hey, you!
This is my friend's property!' 'What do we do with her?' asked the nervous passenger.
He saw only urgency, and not the abundant time they had to complete their operation.
Before they knew it though, there was the drenched, spectral figure of Christopher, beside the driver's door and carrying a body.
The woman in the Barbour jacket was silenced, as a back door of the car was flung open, and the soaked man, with his clearly deceased friend with awful injuries, clambered in.
The body was flung in ahead, with a lack of care that to the woman displayed everything un-Christian in this world.
'I'm sorry,' said Chris to Anna, who was already in the backseat, and now had the lifeless body of her brother pressed up against her.
Chris them climbed in also, to make it three.
'You drive,' said Chris to Ellie, pulling his door closed.
'We haven't time to change seats.'
But Ellie was one step ahead of him, and already had the car in low gear and spitting gravel.
It spun across the uneven surface of the yard, and past the woman, back onto the tarmac road.
'What about your own car?' she asked, while working the gearstick like a rally driver.
'The police were closer than I realised, I couldn't have got Danny into it and driven away in time.
Only Anna and I had been in it, there'll be no DNA.'
Chris, for all his heroics, sensed the car were annoyed with him.
After mere seconds for nerves to die down, these feelings emerged, 'You made us all go back there,' chided Victor, looking over his shoulder for police lights.
'We could all have been caught.
And we couldn't even call you back with a better plan - your phone was already dead.'

"Thank you," she said, raising an arm at his urging, allowing him to wash that side and under the arm.
"This is decadent, I think."
He chuckled, as he did her back, then the other side.
The idea of a man doing such a thing for a woman hadn't even occurred to her, and certainly, was something that would be even better were she no longer sick.
Best not to find out how much better, though.
Before she speculated very far on that he applied a towel and rubbed briskly, then touched her shoulder and said, "lay on your stomach and I'll get the rest.
Unless you'd be...uncomfortable?"
She kissed his cheek.
He really was sweet.
The nightmare was receding into a memory.
The headache, too.
Apparently her fever had broken.
"Hey!"
Finished drying her legs, he bent to place a kiss on her bare derriere.
What does one say to that?
"Don't get upset, lady.
Now you can point at me and say, 'The man worships me.
Hell, he'll kiss my ass on command."
Without thought, she turned and sat up, forgetting her nudity and placing a hand across his lips.
"Don't say that, David...please.
