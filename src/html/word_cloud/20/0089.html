Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability. (MET)' 'It says a lot that he did n't come back.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

                        <pre>
Her parents are well-known environmental activists, and Britta herself is extremely sensitive about all that earthy stuff.
I've seen her cry over someone stepping on a spider before.
Come to think of it, that person was Chase Ortiz.
As one of the bigger kids with a tough-guy persona, he's always been a bit of a troublemaker.
Chase has always acted "too cool for school", but despite that front, he's actually really smart.
He won a regional contest for a book report back in the fifth grade, and the prize was a field trip for our entire class to Washington, D.C. to visit the Library of Congress.
He thought it was too lame, so he didn't even go.
I remember seeing him stand with his other tough-guy friends that day, and as the bus pulled away I could have sworn I saw a bit of longing in his face.
Since then, I have always suspected that Chase is a huge fraud.
I think he's a smart, caring guy who is playing the role he thinks he's supposed to play.
But just in case I'm wrong...I hope to never get on his bad side.
Kind of like I hope to never be on Wes Nguyen's bad side either.
I wouldn't say he intimidates me.
I hardly know him at all.
I guess I'm more mystified than anything else.
He's always been super nice and polite any time he's spoken to me, but he's really quiet and keeps to himself.
He's tall and wears dark clothes and hangs out with the punk kids, who avoid anything mainstream.
All I really know is that Wes plays the keyboard in a band with some of his friends.
They played at Field Day last year.
The music was a little harder than I'm used to, but they seemed pretty talented.

Sending mental messages from one mage to another was not a common practice because one never knew, without taking precautions, who else or what else could be listening.
"Where?"
Markwood whispered as he marched up a flight of stairs to his office.
"The Twelve Chairs," was the mental reply.
Markwood reached his office and shut the door behind him.
"I'll be there in an hour," he said out loud.
There was no reply.
None was needed.
The meeting had been set.
***
The Twelve Chairs pub was a common gathering spot of wizards for two reasons.
First, the pub was along Mages Way, a major road running from the west through the north side of Bond and ending in the east at the University of Ursia.
Many of the town's wealthier mages, most professors at the university, lived along Mages Way, which was how the road had gotten its name.
The second reason so many mages enjoyed the hospitality of the Twelve Chairs was because a permanent spell of protection had been placed over the establishment.
This spell blocked nearly all forms of magical spying.
Only the most powerful of wizards would be able to break through the spell over the pub.
The Twelve Chairs was a jovial place, small but often full of students and the occasional professor.
The place had its name from the twelve padded stools that fronted its long polished counter, those stools apparently having some secret history about which no one knew anything, the secret lost to time.
There were no other seats in the establishment.
Several tall tables were scattered about the main room, but there were no other places to sit except at the bar.
