These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Cotheme', 'tfidf': 2.3555514467795367, 'lexical_unit': "accompany.v / chase.v / conduct.v / escort.v / follow.v / guide.v / hound.v / lead.v / pursue.v / shadow.v / shepherd.v / tail.v / track.v / trail.v / pursuit.n / pursuer.n / usher.v / stalk.v / tag along.v / walk.v / guided.a / dog.v / dog (someone's) steps.idio / show.v / lead the way.v", 'definition': "This frame contains words that necessarily indicate the motion of two distinct objects.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Letting himself be foolish once again over that woman was obviously a massive mistake.
Why the hell did he completely lose his head where she was concerned?
He loved his wife and he loved his children.
Who was Penny anyway but a giant tease that had been leading him on all night?
Even as he attempted to justify his behaviour with that thought, he knew Penny had not done anything wrong.
He loved her too much to paint her in that kind of light.
He just felt so god damn guilty.
Deciding to head on home, Mitchell had made his way toward the front door.
It wouldn't take long to cross over the bridge toward home.
Besides, if Russell had overheard he and Penny talking, he figured he was in no shape to do deal with that right now.
Earlier, as Dayna and Russell had angrily walked through the dwindling party crowd, they'd quickly ascertained that Mitchell was nowhere in sight.
"Maybe he's in the john," Dayna suggested.
"Yeah, or maybe he knows we're onto him and he's making a swift exit."
Both of them walked down the other side of the house and walked out into the middle of the street.
Dayna spotted Mitchell first, his strawberry blonde hair shining under the streetlamps.
Instantly feeling protective of her husband, Dayna reached out for Russell's arm.
Before she could coax him away, Russell started bolting down the street.
Having no choice but to follow, Dayna hitched her skirt up to her knees and followed him down toward the creek.
"You lying sack of shit!
Pretending to be a mate whilst all the while you were screwing my wife!"

She kissed him.
"It looks wonderful."
Over dinner, Tanji chattered about her past life, Kevin being content to sit and listen.
He learned that she had been married, once, but this was now all over.
She had been away from the Guild for a long time - over five years - trying unsuccessfully to start a family.
Her ex-husband who, it appeared, had worked for the Board of Construction was very keen to have children, and Kevin got the impression that it was the stress of being unable to get pregnant that had at least partially caused the break-up of the relationship.
Now that they were separated, she was back at work and trying to rebuild her life.
After dinner, Kevin suggested that they abandon the kitchen and the dirty dishes for later.
Taking their wineglasses with them, they moved to the lounge-cum-study that was the main room in the flat.
Slightly at a loss for something to talk about, Kevin suggested that she might like to look at his computer models for the New Bridge.
They sat together at the desk while Kevin booted up the laptop.
It rapidly became clear to him that Tanji did not really understand the model, or even the idea of a computer.
Even so, she seemed spellbound by the images of both sides of the bridge and the detailed descriptions of the joining section between the two worlds.
"It's fascinating," she breathed.
"So clever."
She drew his hands away from the keyboard.
"Take me to your bed," she whispered.
Chapter Twelve
After his memorable first visit to the Island, Kevin attended several further briefings with Professor Alan Wilmington at NISSA.
These orientation sessions were always one-on-one, and highly intensive.
