In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the  Connector remains to bind the two entities (either Item and Goal, or two Items), without creating a new entity.  'The robber tied Harry to the chair.'

Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they\'re expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context.   \'The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy .\' \'I \'m sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand .\' \'I thought, like, maybe you would know .\' \'My father was something of a dilettante .\' \'He rather doubts you\'ll be able to convince your mom. \' \'\' Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:  \'Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side .\' \'\' There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following:  \'When a standard vaccuum can\'t even pick up the clods, you know you\'ve kinda got a problem.\' \'\' Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., "a tad", "a little", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number ("a little whiskey", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average ("a mite stupid", "somewhat confused" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category ("something of a klutz"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition ("I, like, waved it around").  In both cases, the Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting.'}, {'frame': 'Placing', 'tfidf': 2.9452789090479383, 'lexical_unit': 'deposit.v / embed.v / hang.v / immerse.v / implant.v / inject.v / insert.v / insertion.n / lay.v / lean.v / load.v / lodge.v / pack.v / park.v / pile.v / place.v / placement.n / plant.v / position.v / rest.v / set.v / situate.v / smear.v / stand.v / stash.v / stow.v / stuff.v / tuck.v / wrap.v / bag.v / billet.v / bin.v / bottle.v / archive.v / box.v / cage.v / crate.v / file.v / garage.v / pocket.v / shelve.v / stable.v / perch.v / sit.v / daub.v / drizzle.v / dab.v / drape.v / brush.v / dust.v / heap.v / jam.v / rub.v / cram.v / shower.v / pot.v / sheathe.v / warehouse.v / shoulder.v / stick.v / bestow.v / put.v / package.v / plunge.v / arrange.v / emplace.v / enclose.v / implanted.a / gag.v', 'definition': "Generally without overall (translational) motion,  an Agent places a Theme at a location, the Goal, which is profiled.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

If I wanted to pin her legs, she liked it if I wrestled with her.
I keep pushing myself to keep up with her.
When someone screamed in pain, my gut instinct was to succor them.
For Rhada, it was a signal for her wanting more.
I'd really helped her through some serious frustrations, and a great deal of sweat, when the phone rang.
Rhada was facing me, bouncing in my lap with her ball gag back in (she liked to bite during climax).
"Hello?"
I said.
"Hey Cael Nyilas, it is Odette.
Whatchya doing tonight?"
my waitress bed-buddy asked.
"I'm bored out of my skull, doing something worthless," I answered.
"Do you want to come over, or do we want to meet at your place tonight?"
"Ah - um - I live at home with my parents," she confessed.
"Come on over.
I need to clean up a mess first," I told her.
"See you soon."
With that, I hung up and looked into Rhada's eyes.
"You really are a worthless mess."
She sobbed.

                        <pre>
He turned to face Bucky and saw the great ape was slowing down to a walk.
The ape lifted his left arm and punched the roof of the manor, caving in a section and sharing without words just how unhappy he was.
Carson reached up and drew his twin swords, both blades long enough a sane warrior would never even consider dual wielding.
With nothing but animals to fight, Carson found having two blades a benefit, not a curse.
Against Bucky and his two lady-apes, Carson's swords felt like toothpicks.
As he turned, he saw the tower set in the middle of the castle's western wall.
It was square, like the others, and had a door at the base.
Bucky could break the tower apart, given time, but it might be time that gave Carson another option.
Or better yet, another way out.
Without warning, the castaway leapt to the side and ran the five steps he needed to reach the tower door.
He burst through the aging wood shoulder first and then had to pick himself up from the floor.
The inside of the tower was simple: a wooden bench and stone steps that went up around the wall.
There was a landing halfway up next to a narrow window with bars in it.
The last rays of the setting sun shone through it, adding a reddish tint to the tower.
Bucky's roar preceded the ape's fists into the ground just outside the tower.
Large black fingers curled around the door frame and yanked on it, tearing the wood and causing the aged mortar holding the stones together to crack and give way.
The entrance was being enlarged faster than Carson had imagined.
He looked at his swords and considered hacking at Bucky's fingers.
That would buy him a little time and drive the ape into an even greater rage.
He sheathed his blades and ran up the staircase instead.
