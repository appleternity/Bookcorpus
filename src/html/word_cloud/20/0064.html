        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

She shook her head.
That's no way to think, Mags.
Declan has been writing for weeks, and 'tis at his bidding that I'm coming West.
He's asked me to marry him, and I've accepted.
That's all there is to that.
It seemed like hours before the train finally began to roll, and those first few ear-splitting screeches of the large iron wheels against the metal tracks were the most unnerving sound Margaret had ever heard.
When they finally began to move with some measure of speed, the swaying of the cars was almost as upsetting to her stomach as the rolling waves of the Atlantic had been.
This would be the longest journey of her life, and one that she met with equal parts joy, excitement, and dread.
Chapter Three
"You call this a home, O'Bryan?"
Ned called out from the doorway of Declan's cabin.
"It looks more like a bear's den!"
"I'm not finished yet," he shot back, trying to keep the irritation from his voice.
Declan had neglected his work at the mill on the excuse of needing to make furniture for his cabin, something he'd been able to do without for these many months of his claim.
But now that he'd followed his nearest neighbor's advice and proposed marriage to a complete stranger, he felt the least he could do--apart from paying her passage to Montana--was have a decent chair built by a real hearth and a comfortable bed to sleep in.
The barn had served him well as he tended his animals, but even he knew that any wife worth having would be furious--and rightly so--at not finding so much as a stick of furniture in the place.
"Well, I'd loan you some of my own pieces, but with Clara just arrived almost two months ago, I can't very well go telling her she'll have to sit on the floor and eat her meals at the back of the wagon 'causes I gave away all our sticks!"
Ned laughed, and Declan struggled to find the humor in it.
"No, you're right.
'Twould not do at all!

He stopped and ducked behind one of the large trees.
Mingan raced across the lawn and disappeared behind a bush.
What Lucas saw next sent shivers to his very soul.
As the shadow walked towards the entrance another appeared to morph slowly behind it, eyes glowed, paws outstretched as if to strangle.
The first shadow fell to the ground; the second one disappeared.
Lucas made his way to the fallen prey.
The gray wolf sniffing its victim.
In a whisper, "I didn't know you could do that.
This might be easier than I thought."
Lucas crouched down to listen to his phone.
He had the sound on low--static--well, better than screaming.
What to do with the body, the guy was alive, just unconscious, but for how long.
Mingan tried to help roll the man in the bushes when Eric's voice came over the phone.
"We found a way through the back, going in."  Picking the phone up from the ground Lucas responded with a shaky, be careful.
It was just a matter of time before all hell broke loose as he walked with his protector to the front door.
It was locked.
Should he knock?
The place looked empty.
Was it too late?
Had everyone gone?
