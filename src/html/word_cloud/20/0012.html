Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In the  inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in.  Similarly, most inheriting frames profile only the Affected entity, not the full Effect situation which is often incorporated into the frame or the particular target.  So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).  'He made me angry.'

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"All right, if you promise to stop going through my things to learn details about my private life, I promise not to elope with Jamison and have ten children.
I'll even keep being your friend.
How does that sound?"
"Sounds wonderful to me."
Sarah looked relieved.
I had a feeling that keeping her nose out of my business was going to be more difficult for her than she realized, but I knew she was a well-meaning girl very deep down.
This scare would probably keep her out of trouble for a week or two, at any rate.
***
While Belle was reading book after book on magical objects and sorcerer's chains, I had an idea of my own.
The troubling dream did not return to haunt my sleep, but it was with me during the day.
When I passed into a shadow, when my mind wandered from Belle for just a moment, when everything suddenly paused and the entire manor stopped to listen to a sound that was not there, I saw the large, burning black eye in my mind.
It made my stomach squeeze and my heart curl in my throat.
I decided to ask Cate about the pendant.
Sarah had revealed that she was from an ancient Amendyrri family.
Perhaps she had lived there as a child.
She might know something about dream-telling, especially since she could See.
Better yet, she might know of a way to get rid of frightening dreams and visions.
I spent many hours at night thinking of what to say to her, but in the end, I just blurted it out.
"I know you can See."
Cate was not surprised.

"Tristan, like he said."
"Why would you not have mentioned him to me?
I definitely would have remembered him if you had."
"It never came up," I whisper back, and a nervous rush of adrenaline bites me in the heart.
I am so glad I did not mention him now, or the cover would have been blown.
This is all so stupid.
"I'll be fine."
"Are you sure?"
asks Bella.
"This isn't like you."
"You guys can move to a table for two now," I say, though I don't mean for it to be rude or jealous or anything, because Tristan is beside us now, and I stand up.
For a man I've seen once before and met just now, he seems to be a good guy; and he's the perfect height for me, I realize with a smile.
If he's a serial killer, I've got pepper spray in my clutch, along with a little tube of Chapstick and a pocketknife that my father insists I carry.
I reach down and kiss Bella's head and wave at Tony, but I can't resist the little evil seed of joy this is doing to me, and I feel Tristan's hand on the small of my back, and I'm suddenly reconsidering this vengeful little idea.
What the heck are you doing?
We make it outside, and there's the steady pulse of cars racing by us, but Tristan pushes me away from the door, so that we're standing in the darkness.
"Time to tell your story," I say, pushing my finger at him.
My tone is already different.
"What the heck was that?
Is your name even really Tristan Taylor?"
