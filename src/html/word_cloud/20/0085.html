These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

Henry looked back towards the fence and could see several of the teenagers were missing the lower portions of their arms.
He looked down as his arm and could see two hands and forearms still gripped around his wrist.
He threw his arms around in the air to detach the grasp of the limbs.
The arms fell to the ground with a dull thud.
He looked back to the fence and the teenagers.
Neither of the teenagers showed any sign of pain at the detachment of their limbs.
The bloody stumps he expected to be spraying and dripping blood at the severing of a semi-major artery were dry.
"What that hell are those things?"
Henry turned and scrambled up the hill and onto the highway.
Without glancing back towards the fence, Henry crossed the road, walked down into the median and on the other side.
Henry focused on making it to the Wholesale store that was at the other end of the mall.
If he had taken a moment to look behind him, he would have noticed several members of the group trying to mimic what he had done earlier by climbing the fence to get at him.
Chapter Thirteen
Henry walked down the embankment on the far side of the highway and crossed through a little clearing in a row of hedges and stepped into the parking lot of the town's mall.
The mall was a typical commercial mall designed in a plus shape to be able to put four large box stores at the end of each row to draw people to the mall just to shop at those locations.
On an average day, the mall did not open until 10 am and seeing as how the monsters were downtown at nine the parking lot of the mall was pretty empty.
There were a few cars scattered in different spots through the parking lot.
Most likely the managers or key holders arriving to get the stores ready for the shoppers that day.
Henry was standing at the end of the mall that featured entrances to the movie theatre and chain bookstore.
There were about a dozen cars parked in front of the movie theatre, probably a couple of cleaning crews trying to scrape chewing gum of the bottoms of the seats, and layers of butter from the floor underneath those seats.

Wonder who got to him."
"Roberts would know."
"So he would."
But will he tell me, that's the question.
I decide to hustle out there and find out.
"You done yet?"
I ask Sketch.
He leans back a little, staring at his work, then makes a couple more passes with the charcoal.
Satisfied, he rips the big sheet of paper from the easel and hands it to me.
I stare at it a long minute, trying to figure out what bothers me about it.
It's my face, I suppose.
Eyes, nose, mouth, jaw, all pretty much where they're supposed to be.
So why do I look so goddam sad?
"That ain't me," I tell him.
"That's what the fat lady said."
He holds out his hand.
"Where's my buck?"
There are only a few reasons you'd want to go to Gardena.
It's a good place to pawn things.
Three or four pawnshops right out on the main drag.
