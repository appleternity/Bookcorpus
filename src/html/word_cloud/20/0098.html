These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Age', 'tfidf': 1.1871487631356004, 'lexical_unit': 'old.a / ancient.a / young.a / youngish.a / oldish.a / age.n / new.a / fresh.a / of.prep / maturity.n / mature.a / elderly.a', 'definition': "An Entity has existed for a length of time, the Age.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

I have embarrassed you," he said softly.
I shook my head.
"No, it is good that you forewarned me.
I can only imagine the embarrassment of becoming locked in such a gaze while dancing with ..."
"The King?"
he suggested.
"Goodness!"
I exclaimed.
"Can you imagine?
Oh, I would curl up and die if such a thing happened!"
"That is why you must look around you often whilst dancing with anyone other than Kurit.
There is many an uncouth wretch who, having an old and miserable wife, will seek to catch a pretty young girl in such a state.
In fact, I shall warn you now that Lord Staesh, the wealthy sea merchant from Penklin, is the worst of the lot for that trick.
It's unlikely that you will have enough dances to spare to grant him one, but be forewarned."
He took my hands away from my face gently and apologized again.
"I hope that I have not made you uncomfortable."
I shook my head and smiled at him.
"Jarik, I trust you.
You, Leiset, and of course Kurit are my dearest friends.
And with the beatings that you give Kurit for being a rascal, I know you to be good and honourable."

Hal Linden held a martini to his lips and nearly spilled it down his shirt when he caught sight of her.
He quickly recovered and casually waved a hand in the air, directing Morgan to his end of the bar and the men who hovered within his sphere of influence.
Putting on a show, Linden placed his drink on the bar and barreled through the crowd to greet his prodigal protege.
He kissed her on both cheeks and took her by the hand, providing her safe passage through the den of business wolves.
He introduced her to his cadre of cronies.
The names sped by her - Walter, Joseph, Buck, Channing.
None of it mattered.
Morgan had been the wined-and-dined wife of the Fortune 500 club.
As a veteran of such rarified air, nothing much impressed her.
Certainly, not this collection of B-listers, stock brokers, bank vice presidents and insurance swindlers.
"So what are we drinking?"
Hal Linden inquired after polishing off his martini in one final gulp.
His ruddy cheeks glowed with an alcoholic light.
It hadn't been his first glass.
"A Pinot, perhaps," Morgan ventured.
Linden frowned.
"All this time, I've been grooming you for the Big Boys' Club, and you order wine?"
the gimpy ex-college quarterback slurred.
"I'm sorry."
Morgan played along.
