The Mental_content may be presented in clearly propositional form as a finite clause. It may also take the form of an embedded question or be a concealed question in the form of a simple NP.    ' I was impressed that she 'd actually remembered Radish 's name (= what Radish's name is) '    'Oh, and for those who like to continually whinge about how the French are 'surrender monkeys' - remember Napoleon (= who Napoleon was)?'  ' I ca n't remember what  DSP stands for.'  'And Bill can still remember the pattern (= what the pattern is). '  'What do you remember about your grandma?'  '' Notice that this frame is very general. It can be used to talk about detailed reports of past experience.  'I don't know if I lost consciousness for a while. But I remember that I was lying in the middle of the road with people trying to assist me.'  ''  Notice that Mental_content reported within this frame is presented as factive, i.e. as reliable and accurate. Consider the following contrasts:  '1a. I remember her as selfish--but I might be wrong.' '1b. ??I remember that she was selfish--but I might be wrong.'  '2a. Bill remembers her as smarter than she is.' '2b.*Bill remembers that she is smarter than she is.'  The (b) sentences, which belong in this frame, are less acceptable than the (a)-sentences as they suggest  that the Cognizer  takes their memory to be accurate while suggesting at the same time that the memory might be or is inaccurate. In the (a) sentences, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no contradiction as the remembering is taken to be subjective and not necessarily accurate. '' The concealed question uses with personal names that occur in this frame are not always easy to distinguish from instances of the Remembering_experience frame where a Salient_entity alone is referred to in 3a and 3b, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no question of identity: remembering here means thinking of one's memories of the relevant person. 3c is different: the hearer is asked whether they know who the person is; it belongs in this frame.  '3a. I remember her fondly' '3b. Please take a moment to remember Caesar and his Family.' '3c. Do you remember Alexander the Great? He was one of history's most prolific conquerors, and he did it all in his twenties.'

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

His vicious smile showed that he enjoyed killing.
Michael would never forget those faces.
The horses pulling their wagon were running frantically, and the wagon was bouncing over the heavy clumps of grass, making it impossible for Michael to stand.
In panic, the horses ran across a small gully, flipping the wagon over on its back, pinning Michael and his dead father beneath it.
When the wagon flipped over, the frightened horses broke free from their hitch and ran off, dragging their harness.
The Indians wanted those horses and continued in full pursuit yelling and whooping.
When Michael regained consciousness, he had a large lump on his head and felt sick.
He had no way of knowing how long he had been unconscious, but he remembered that the attack had occurred in the late afternoon, and it was morning now.
He listened.
It was quiet.
His father lay dead only a few feet away.
At first, Michael was too stunned to cry, but he didn't know what else to do.
He had seen his mother and father killed.
He was only twelve years old and completely alone.
He would never go into the woods again with his father or hear his mother reading to him.
It was more than he could bear.
Michael cried until his body had nothing else to give.
The silence was so complete that it was overwhelming.
The heat was building up inside the overturned wagon.
He was hungry and thirsty, but the water barrel, which had been tied to the side of the wagon, lay in splinters.

They were so close on making a breakthrough on their case."
Kristi perked up at the mention of Don and Maria's real names.
She debated whether she should make herself known to the two men, but decided against it.
It was too risky to do so.
She listened to their conversation with renewed interest.
"Who's going to be taking up Shelly and Kyle's case now?"
"I don't know for sure, but I assume Tiffany will.
She worked closely with Kyle and Shelly."
Someone stumbled into Kristi, almost knocking her off the stool.
She leapt off the chair as the person struck it with enough force to break bones.
Kristi calmed her heartbeat and resituated herself, then refocused her attention back to the conversation.
But her slight movements were noticed by one of the men.
"Hush up.
We're being observed."
"Let's go," said his partner.
They both stood up and exited the tavern.
Kristi silently cursed for not being more discreet.
Nevertheless, she had gathered enough information to make the trek through the rain worth the trip to Troll's Tavern.
Two off-duty law enforcers took the seats left by the men in dark clothes.
Kristi beat a swift retreat; the last thing she needed was to be caught.
