The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they\'re expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context.   \'The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy .\' \'I \'m sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand .\' \'I thought, like, maybe you would know .\' \'My father was something of a dilettante .\' \'He rather doubts you\'ll be able to convince your mom. \' \'\' Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:  \'Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side .\' \'\' There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following:  \'When a standard vaccuum can\'t even pick up the clods, you know you\'ve kinda got a problem.\' \'\' Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., "a tad", "a little", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number ("a little whiskey", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average ("a mite stupid", "somewhat confused" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category ("something of a klutz"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition ("I, like, waved it around").

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Ingestion', 'tfidf': 1.163519539599859, 'lexical_unit': 'lap.v / slurp.v / swig.v / guzzle.v / gulp.v / down.v / sip.v / sup.v / munch.v / nosh.v / feast.v / feed.v / snack.v / breakfast.v / lunch.v / dine.v / ingest.v / nurse.v / nibble.v / eat.v / drink.v / gobble.v / devour.v / consume.v / sip.n / gulp.n / swig.n / slurp.n / have.v / imbibe.v / quaff.v / swill.v / put away.v / put back.v / tuck.v / ingestion.n', 'definition': "An Ingestor consumes food or drink (Ingestibles), which entails putting the Ingestibles in the mouth for delivery to the digestive system.

In the  inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in.

Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).

There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

"Seriously?
What were you expecting?
A big room just because you're a celebrity?
You got the same room as everyone else.
And to be honest? it's a beautiful room.
I'd give anything to have a room like this," Tamara said.
She felt annoyed that she hadn't been able to keep her cool.
But in that instant, she felt the heat rising to her face in anger.
How dare he tell her that the room was small?
He smiled at her.
He obviously found her very amusing.
He held up his hands in protest.
"Whoa.
I'm not being nasty.
I said the room was cool.
It is cool.
I like it."
Tamara huffed.

"That would be difficult since I don't even know."
"I know and I'm sorry about that.
I'll let you know where I am when I get there.
I don't want anyone to know before then."
"I remember.
Anyway, meet me at the car after school and I'll drive you home."
"Thanks" Cori said as her friend walked away to her next class.
Cori entered the classroom and prepared for one of the last tests she would ever take in high school.
Two days before graduation, Cori watched Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds leave the house next door late in the afternoon and decided this was her opportunity.
She was done studying so she had time to focus on this one last item that needed to be taken care of before she left Catesville, Texas.
She took the eight pieces of paper that she had printed off her computer stuffed them in a large envelope and left her bedroom.
Since no one was at her house, she locked the back door as she left and walked quickly through the backyard to the side yard and slipped into the side yard of the Reynolds' house next door.
At the back door of the Reynolds' house she knocked hoping that someone would answer that door instead of the front door.
A short minute after knocking, she heard the doorknob turning and saw the door opening.
"Hi Cori" Micah Reynolds greeted.
"Hi Micah.
I didn't know you were home."
"I just got home today.
Summer break for me too.
And I needed to be here to see Seth graduate."
