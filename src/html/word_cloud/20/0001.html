That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet. 
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the correct one.</span>

That and the wine had meant that Elizabeth didn't have to worry, and that in turn meant that Harriet didn't have to worry either.
Harriet drew in a deep breath.
It was a reflex action that would power the deep sigh that followed.
It was simply one of the bodies' automatic functions, something that required no conscious effort or thought.
As soon as she had taken the breath, she thought about it.
It pulled heavily, stretching the bruised muscle on the left side of her chest.
It was discomfort rather than pain.
Like the tenderness on the top of her head.
Like the dull ache and stiffness of her left elbow, where a large yellow and blue bruise was already forming.
Her ankle, that was a different matter.
At this moment in time it was uncomfortable, partly due to the fact that it was almost frozen, but it would be painful soon enough as soon as she got up.
Yet more symptoms of attacks on her, attacks intended to do her serious harm.
She had no reason to believe that she was pushed down the stairs deliberately but, then again, she had no idea what had caused that plunge.
The inescapable truth was that it was a direct result of the abduction by Ivan.
She didn't list Ivan as an attacker somehow.
She didn't really think that he could have carried out his duties.
He was as much a victim as she was.
In some ways more so.
At the end of the day it was still another attack.
Another attempt to kill her.

"What?
What do you mean?"
Lindsay leaned to whisper in his ear.
Josh continued to sit in the recliner, staring at the TV as if he were miles away.
"They have him.
We'll talk later."
They had him?
Oh God, what if something happened?
Sam's stomach clenched.
Either they'd free Alex, or things would get nasty very fast.
He couldn't sit and just wait for more news.
It was going to kill him.
He wanted to be with Gerome right now, to make sure Alex was safe.
But Lindsay wasn't simply going to drive him there, and he doubted he could steal a car from the King's garage.
Besides, even if he managed to steal a car, he had no idea where to go. Shit. Sam got up and started to pace.
What if something happened to Alex?
Would he see his man again?
Until now, he'd hoped Alex was safe because he was valuable.
But now, if the kidnappers knew they would soon be discovered, they might kill Alex to prevent Gerome and the others from taking him away.
Lindsay came up to him.
