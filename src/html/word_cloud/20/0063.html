        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

                        <h5>(An excerpt from the book <span style="font-weight:bold;">"Gwarcheidial Book 1"</span>.)</h5>
                        <br/>
                        <pre>
His little brown hat had a small hole in the brim of it so that his left ear could poke through, the other ear being quite visible and of the same large size was poking out from under the brim on the other side, this made him look quite unique.
He had on a little green jacket; this was pulled in at the waist with a brown leather belt fastened with what looked like a bright shiny gold buckle.
That again was a little odd, usually they would spend some time carving their own little designs into their buckles and they would normally be fashioned out of wood.
He also looked to be a very clean and tidy Gnome, even to the point of being fastidious; there was also a great deal of pride in his eyes.
Wizzo when he was very young had wondered about the size of their noses.
It wasn't until he actually saw one smelling a flower that he noticed how much that little bulbous nose quivered with the excitement and the pleasure that it gave them, he understood then why Gnomes worked so hard on their gardens.
He also found out much later when he was able to hear and feel the thoughts of others what an extreme pleasure it was for them.
When he smelt a rose, all the roses on that tree would smell the same, this was not so for a Gnome, their noses was so sensitive that even roses on the same tree would each have their own individual and entirely different smell.
This gnome had arrogance and pride and when he looked up at Wizzo, he showed it.
This startled Wizzo, a Gnome had never, ever looked at him like that.
"Sorry!"
was all he could think of saying and then smiling he turned and said to Sophie.
"There's a gnome out here, a cute arrogant little fellow, it looks like his fixing up the garden."
"Can I see im?"
Asked Sophie almost pleading with him, Wizzo thought about that for a minute.
"I'll carry you."
Going over and picking her up gently so as not to disturb the Fairy he carried her to the window.
The gnome, who was now back to his digging stopped, looked up and smiled at her.
"He smiled at you; --- he didn't smile at me!"
said the dejected Wizzo.

"It's not important now," she said dully.
Tess felt as if someone had a fist inside her chest, squeezing her heart in an attempt to crush it.
She didn't know if she had the strength to endure this anymore.
There'd been too much lately.
As selfish and unfair as it was, she was hurt and angry that Kyra would be lumped in with those other girls.
She was unique and special.
Tess's mind rebelled against her being one of them, when she had been one of us.
Tess knew with a certainty she had to be very careful with her response to this.
She knew everyone would be watching her reaction to make sure she didn't crack.
She could almost feel the powers that be trying to rip her case, this case, away from her.
She wasn't going to let that happen.
Slowly and carefully, she reached inside herself and began to reconstruct her glass box.
She was going to find Kyra's killer and she was going to make him pay.
Yes, rage felt so much better than pain...and more manageable.
Slowly, Tess sat up and moved a little out of Anthony's comforting embrace.
His need to protect and comfort her made her feel vulnerable and unable to begin building the walls necessary around her emotions to deal with this situation.
So she began putting distance between them, both physically and mentally.
She swiped her unruly waves out of her face and turning to Anthony said, "Does Dominic know?"
"I'm not sure.
The only thing I was told was the Chief was going to Kyra's parents' house this morning.
