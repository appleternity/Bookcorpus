The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Purpose', 'tfidf': 2.6035090914609906, 'lexical_unit': 'purpose.n / goal.n / aim.n / objective.n / object.n / target.n / aim.v / intend.v / intention.n / use.n / plan.v / in order.adv / plan.n / bent.a / intent.a / determined.a / mean.v', 'definition': "An Agent wants to achieve a Goal,  or an object.  A Means  has been created or is used to allow the creator or a user to achieve a  Goal.

In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read.

On the bus was a young girl, early twenties.
She told me her mother had died; she was going to her home for the burial.
She was being very brave.
The journey progressed; the girl would have little bouts of crying.
When she finally neared her destination she became very distraught.
Getting off at her stop, I watched her cross the road.
She was met by family members, the floodgates opened.
She wailed, flung her arms about, family members tried to console her.
Finally she collapsed, a small cart was found and she was put into the back and taken away.
The area around Georgetown and Bansang is very nice.
The River sweeps around corners, there's lush vegetation on the side of the riverbanks.
If you're lucky you will see hippo and monkeys.
In Bansang I was staying in a family run guest house.
The father had died; the children were struggling to keep the place going.
They owned a building attached to the guest house.
It was a nightclub, the only one in town.
It had ceased trading; they were letting the building to a German man.
He made it into a casino, just a load of old slots shoved in there.
The amazing thing was how well used it was.
The people using it looked very poor, villagers not business types.

He had no idea how long he'd been here, it could have been minutes or hours, the passing of time had lost all significance.
Then his body stiffened and in that moment he knew someone was about to come through the front door.
Suddenly, every sense was amplified.
His body moved ahead of his mind and when he heard the key turn in the lock he was already up and waiting by the bedroom door.
He heard two men talking in low voices, then one set of footsteps came down the hallway and stopped outside the door.
If whoever it was expected to find the key to the bedroom where he'd left it then he gave no indication of any concern he might have at not seeing it there.
He came straight into the room with no hesitation whatsoever.
He was reaching for the light switch when Nick stepped out of the shadows.
The eyes widened in shock, but before the man could react Nick had driven an open palm directly under his chin, snapping his head back.
The neck went with an audible crack and the man slumped to the floor in a lifeless heap.
Nick stepped over the body, drawn sword in his left hand.
He had it raised above his head when the second man came out of the living room, holding a gun.
Before the man could turn into the hall, Nick brought the sword down in a flashing arc, severing the gun hand at the wrist.
The hand's owner stared in disbelief as he watched his useless limb tumble to the floor, the fingers still wrapped tightly around the gun's handle.
Then he clutched at the stump of his arm and roared in pain as he turned to face his tormentor.
He was a big man with a thick neck.
There wasn't much room in the hall to swing a sword, so Nick improvised a diagonal overhead sweep, which he straightened out into a horizontal slicing stroke at the last moment.
When it connected with the man's neck the sword went through the flesh and bone almost as if it wasn't there.
His roar of pain became a gurgle and his head hit the floor, closely followed by the rest of him.
Nick stepped back as the arterial blood spray spattered the walls.
