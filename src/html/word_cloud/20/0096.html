In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion ("in a box"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change ("in the garden").

(When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) \'The pole snapped off in her hand .\' \'She combed her hair between her fingers .\' \'\'  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: \'Inside my wallet is where i put it .\' \'Outside your blind date\'s door seems like the worst place in the world .\' \'\'  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: \'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  \'Is the economy in recession ?\' \'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI \' \'\'  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer\'s mind (construed as a Ground): \'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI\' \'I felt an unease inside me .\' \'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .\' \'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .\' \'\'  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): \'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .\' \'There are so many children in the family .\' \'\'  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: \'amid the confusion\' \'inside the competition period\' \'between lunch and dinner\' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word "period") while others can take events as Grounds directly. \'\'  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): \'In the paper , `` self-control \'\' is used to mean a sense of willpower .\' \'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .\' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. \'\' \'\'  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>

Whatever David promised was effective, and with only a few grumbles, he let Officer Marks do his hind paws.
Bas told me the first set of clothes were being spread out on the tarp, the woman's underwear was kept in a baggie to the side and would be brought out for Red's inspection after he was finished with the outer garments.
Red worked well with Detective Stephens and, surprisingly to me, Detective Westfield, whom I assumed would only observe.
There were a few accidents when Red trod on a piece of clothing, but it was expected this might happen and the detectives got used to Red's preferred way to examine the clothing.
We had already discussed Red would be looking for male scents.
While Red was sniffing, he didn't bother to give me a play-by-play of what he was doing, although I'd get the occasional, "Oh man, that's neat," or, "Could Stephens lift this so I can smell the other side?"
I would relay instructions as needed, but I kept silent for most of the examination.
When Red had worked for about fifteen minutes, I addressed Lt. Faber who sat next to me, making sure everyone could hear my voice.
"I want to warn you Red has unusually evolved reasoning skills.
His assessment may contain some of his conclusions, which I have found to be uncannily accurate.
I will try to be clear about what is factual and what is conjectured, and why he reached a certain conclusion."
A few minutes later, Red was finished.
I repeated what he said and then answered his questions or asked questions of my own.
"There are two men," he began.
"Let's call them John and Bob," I told him.
"John's scent is all over.
Her coat, outer clothes, bra, and panties, but it's a deep scent, I think he's a boyfriend."
"What about Bob?"
"Bob's smell is probably the bad man.
He has his scent over the front of the shirt and the front of her jeans.

Had Falk been able to understand the language then he would have read the words as 'The House of the Silver Queen'.
Falk stepped over the final step and beyond the threshold of the dwelling.
The moment he did so several things happened all at once.
The first was that an enormous pain erupted in his right hand, the hand with which he'd struck the guardsman in Alesven who killed Aldwyn.
The second thing was that a fire seemed to erupt under his cloak, in the pocket where he'd stored the lightning knife he got outside the city, this itself also cause a searing pain in Falks side, the third and most inconvenient thing at the time was that someone threw a black bag over his head, after several seconds of vain pain-filled struggling he was struck with something and not for the first time in recent months Falks consciousness gave up and he faded into darkness.
Chapter 8
At first he thought he was drowning when he woke, then he realised after a few disorientating moments that his captures had doused him in water in order to wake him, he still wore the hood, a thick dark material that did not betray its purpose.
Falk could smell burning lamp and and heard several sets of shuffling footsteps in the vicinity.
Whispers came to Falks ears, a chorus of them babbling, he could make out the odd phrase, 'he wakes' 'he wakes' 'beware the walker'.
Then he heard a voice that was most definitely not a whisper, a deep throaty growling voice which made him jump in his shackles on the hard wooden chair to which he was bound.
"Not the brightest thing are you worm, what did you think was going to happen to that lightning when you brought it across the threshold?".
Falk remembered the searing pain in his side, the stranger was right, it hadn't occurred to him that the broken shard would come back to life.
Falks throat was dry and he could barely croak out a few words.
"My hand, you broke my hand" he could still feel the numb pain of the broken bones.
This drew a derisory snort from the growling voice.
"WHAT?
Do you think we are torturers eh worm, believe me were that our way your body would be a sea of pain right now".
Another voice cut in.
It was a womans voice, soft and lilting, an accent that Falk could not place.
Its softness concealed a steel, Falk could hear both strength and also a hint of suspicion as it spoke "Your hand was broken ere you entered my house stranger, as my surly friend says to torture is not our way, even with those who deserve it" the implication was not lost on Falk.
