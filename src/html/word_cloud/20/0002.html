That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Some members of the frame (e.g. grow.v) tend to emphasize a gradual change, while most members of the frame do not indicate whether a change is gradual or not.    'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Arriving', 'tfidf': 2.608068995461531, 'lexical_unit': 'approach.n / approach.v / arrival.n / arrive.v / come.v / enter.v / entrance.n / return.n / return.v / visit.n / visit.v / reach.v / make.v / get.v / make it.v / descend (on).v / crest.v / entry.n / influx.n / hit.v / appear.v / find.v', 'definition': "An object Theme moves in the direction of a Goal.

And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.

This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet. 
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the correct one.</span>

Her body shook with pleasure once again.
They lay there kissing each other caressing each other.
Max then said.
"Kate, I will never tire of you."
Kate loved what Max done.
He gave to her and she wanted more of it.
She still reacted to him the way she always did.
When she wanted him to give to her, she would walk up to him and say his name softly.
At first he didn't know what she was doing, but he caught on fast and smiled.
Max knew what Kate wanted and he was more than happy to give.
Kate was calm tender and he pleased her to no end.
He thought maybe this might calm her down some.
She always seemed so calm after.
Max decided to test it out and see.
Chapter 20
It was mid-week at work and Max and Kate were having nothing but problems.
It seemed like every time they turned around something was breaking.
Max was getting furious and Kate was getting more excited.
She was helping fix things.
But her feelings and the way her body reacted to him, was getting Max more aggravated.

Thus, she and the other two inhabitants of her car were required to park their vehicle and enter a building, whereupon they were forced to stand in a line of about a dozen people.
It appeared that all was going smoothly, as each person was allowed to pass.
Thus, she and her fellow conspirators determined to bide their time and hope for the best.
"Papers, please!"
the guard said to her as she reached the head of the line.
Felicite handed him her papers.
"What are you doing coming here from Paris, Fraulein," he inquired.
"I did not come here from Paris.
I came from Morainvilliers, where I live.
I am here to visit my aunt," she replied.
"And who is your aunt?"
he queried.
"Madame Antonia San Michel," she replied.
"Sit down here and wait, Fraulein," he replied.
Felicite was thus the only person who was held for further questioning.
Under the circumstances, her traveling companions were forced to go on ahead without her.
Felicite waited for several hours, finally falling asleep.
By the time she awoke it had grown completely dark.
She waited a bit longer, at which point another soldier came forward and inquired, "Are you Fraulein Felicite Delacroix?"
"Yes," she replied.
