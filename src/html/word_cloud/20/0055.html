        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"Think we need to reassign her for a while?"
Neville asked the question slowly, as if pondering each syllable before letting it out of his hard-lipped mouth.
Pete shook his head.
"No, sir.
She's got this, but you and I both know she'd be happier in a line company."
Neville nodded pensively.
"After that clusterfuck on Regina IV --" "Don't remind me."
Pete shuddered.
The general didn't correct his slip of military manners, whether because he had always expressed a somewhat paternal affection for the junior officer or because he was thinking the same dark thoughts every Marine in the galaxy had anytime the Regina IV massacre came up in conversation.
Among Marines, the debacle could be safely discussed.
Any civilian or newsie brought it up in the presence of devil dogs at great personal peril.
Instead he nodded thoughtfully.
"You're free for the day, right?"
"Yes, sir," Pete replied dutifully.
"Well, how about you come to my office?"
Although phrased as an invitation, Pete knew the "suggestion" was really an order.
"Yes, sir."
* * * "How do you take your whiskey?"
"Neat, please."
Although it was technically the middle of the duty day, the end of a training cycle was always considered a special time for not only the new Marines, but their chains of command.

He could fell the warmth travel down his gullet.
A police car pulled up alongside Penny's car and a policeman got out.
His father went to the door to let him in.
"Do you want a coffee?"
he asked him as the man entered and took off his hat.
"No, thank you.
I'll just have a quick word with Josh."
He sat down in an armchair and pulled out a notebook and pen.
"Good to see you again, Josh."
It was the same policeman who had been first on the scene after Bevan had beaten him up.
"Constable Woodward," the man reminded him.
Josh grunted.
He didn't know if he could speak.
"Do you do the patrols out here?"
Josh's father asked, seeing that Josh couldn't answer.
"Yes, I'm with the Henderson office, which does patrols out here.
It was lucky that we were on the Anawhata Road when the call came through.
We caught up with the ambulance just as it got to the top of the hill."
He looked down at his notes and then at Josh.
"I've got statements from witnesses at the scene, but what can you tell me?"
