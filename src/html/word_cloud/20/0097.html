A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Azor stands, feet apart, Klage held low and forward.
Moonlight glints across the sapphire laced through his granite hide.
"You do not know what a link crew, do you?"
Derek relaxes and turns to fully face Azor.
"No.
Azor re-sheaths Klage, "Well, Golons are granite and gem from crown to toe.
Long swords, spears, arrows are all useless against us.
Generally, even war hammers and maces are a small danger to us.
On the battlefields against humans, dwarves and elves we are a tremendous threat, unstoppable if fought conventionally.
Link crews are how we are brought down.
A group of men, usually eight to a dozen, swarm around a Golon and throw hooked chains at leg, arm and neck.
I have seen my stone brothers fell in this manner.
It will never happen to me."
Raising empty hands and stepping away from the chain at his feet, Derek speaks evenly, "I didn't know, Azor.
I can understand why the sound freaked you out.
I am glad you told me though.
Now I can listen for the sound as we travel and when we are in battle.
I promise you I will not let a chain game anywhere near you."
"Thank you for that pledge, Derek.
Kinewyn swore the same words and kept his promise to this day in our travels together."

I picture the look on everyone's face, especially Ms. Fuentes, if I were to talk about my altered genetic makeup.
Burke must have been thinking the same thing, because I hear him chuckle.
I keep my introduction short, describing only the basics in fluent Spanish, of course.
Ms.
Fuentes already knows me from last year's class, and asks very little of me.
I sense that I am one of the few people that she finds mildly intimidating.
The rest of the day goes by with relative ease.
For some reason, my mind is preoccupied with thoughts of Cat McCullough and as luck would have it, she is in my PE class as well.
I learn that she likes running too, and while most of the other junior girls walk and gossip during the required two mile run, likely worried about ruining their hair and make-up, Cat keeps a respectable pace with most of the guys in class.
As for me, I always have to remind myself to tone it down and not reveal my true athletic abilities.
If anyone saw me run full speed, which is close to 50 miles per hour, throw a ball, or tackle a senior football player, I would be hounded with unwanted questions and attention.
I chuckle to myself, thinking about the wasted money my parents spent to give me these traits, and how disappointed they must be at my lack of interest in organized sports.
I pace myself just behind Cat and Tucker, unsuspectingly eavesdropping in on their conversation for the second time today.
Unfortunately, I learn more about Tucker than I do Cat.
I am getting the impression that she is better at listening than talking, as she quickly changes the subject whenever he questions her about her family.
*** By Friday, the mundane routine of school is interrupted only by the interesting observations of Cat McCullough.
She is completely oblivious to the curious and maybe even envious stares of even some of the more popular girls at school, and spends most of her free time, including lunch, working on homework.
Her attractiveness, confidence, and warm friendly character, makes her a natural magnet for all students within the high school social hierarchy.
She is already being offered inclusion to some of the most preferred cliques.
But it seems to be the outcasts of the school that Cat migrates towards.
