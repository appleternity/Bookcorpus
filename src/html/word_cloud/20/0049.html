In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

According to Sentrian custom the Sabbath was over.
After having coffee with his parents, Charlie asked if he could be excused.
"I need to get my car washed."
Louis nodded.
Charlie did need to keep his car up.
"Hey, Charlie, why don't I go with you?
It's been a while since I've taken a ride in the Mustang."
"That's OK, Father.
I know you'd probably rather read your paper or something.
Enjoy your day off."
"Well, just be back in time for dinner," Louis said.
Charlie retrieved his car keys and walked out the door.

Lilly had finished her homework and practiced her French horn, and she was now organizing her closet.
Michelle had invited her out for dinner and a movie, but Lilly declined.
She wanted to stay home in case Charlie called.
She had just about given up when the phone rang.
"Please be him, please be him, please be him," she said as she ran to the phone.
Even though she was right beside it, she let the phone ring one more time so it didn't seem as if she had been waiting for it to ring all afternoon, which is exactly what she had done.
"Liliana?

After tying her second hand I ran my leather cladded finger down her blood and tear stained cheek.
She shivered with what I could only assume was a mixture of anxiety and fear, although I hoped fear was her overriding emotion, for my benefit at least.
Running my finger down the side of her body, I made my way slowly back around to Gregg and begin to tie his hands in the same way to the sluts.
"Why are you not saying anything?
Anna we need to talk about this. Anna... this isn't you.
Your kind and gentle" Gregg failed to analyse me accurately, clearly he didn't know me that well.
"I still love you Anna" Gregg pleaded and begun pulling at his bonds I had placed securely around his hands.
Looking down at his naked body I ran my leather cladded hand across his torso and down to his groin.
"Please Anna..."
Gregg fearfully whispered.
Staring directly in his eyes I could see how terrified he was of what I was going to do next and how powerless he was, the feeling that was raging through my body was exhilarating and electrifying.
Leaning over his body I ripped the scissors from his hand causing him to howl in agony.
Playing with the scissors in between my fingers I teased Gregg before quickly swiping across his groin and grazing his penis.
"Nooooo!!!!!"
Gregg roared in agony making me giggle maliciously to myself.
"Please don't hurt me please!!!
I'll do anything!
Anything!!!!"
The slut cried hysterically.
Strolling around the bed I made sure that Gregg and his slut were securely fastened to the bed before smiling down at them both and exiting the bedroom.
