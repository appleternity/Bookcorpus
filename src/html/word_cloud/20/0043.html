        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

The attack on the John Finn was without justification, despite some illegal pretence of an exclusion zone.
As yet, NATO had made no comment on the atrocity, but Young was confident the United States would not ignore the John Finn's pain.
In a few hours, a day at most, America would surely respond in kind.
Barvikha, Russia It was proving to be a frustrating afternoon, Grebeshkov growing angrier by the hour, his blood pressure reaching worrying levels as his transfer back to Moscow was thwarted by something as basic as the lack of transport, and for some unclear reason there were no vehicles at the dacha.
The dacha's secure phone line was his preferred link to the outside world, but Grebeshkov's attempts to contact first the Lubyanka, then Irina Golubeva, proved futile with every one of his calls meeting a similar fate - a double ring, then the line went dead.
Cell phones proved equally useless, calls to anywhere in central Moscow merely producing a repetitive 'service not available' message.
By early evening Grebeshkov was resigned to spending another night at Barvikha.
Whatever the news reports might suggest, the authority that came with his new role was far from obvious, and while Markova could no doubt commandeer a vehicle or two, they could easily be turned back at one of the many roadblocks, or even become another target for some over-zealous soldier.
Grebeshkov could feel the paranoia starting to invade his every thought, his mind struggling to understand the real reason for such enforced isolation.
A mixture of persistence and obstinacy ensured he finally managed to get through to Arkady Valentin, the latter having just returned home.
Valentin's friendly greeting helped put Grebeshkov at his ease, the younger man promising to arrange transport together with an appropriate military escort for early the following morning.
They talked together for another fifty minutes, Valentin emphasising that the coup was a coalition of like-minded patriots, all of them angered by the Government's failings and impatient to return the nation to something approaching stability.
Grebeshkov's inclusion had been seen as essential for its success, Valentin readily apologising for their high-handed manner in assuming he would be supportive.
Grebeshkov well knew he had little choice but to endorse the coup's aims and the need for change, and he had been correct in his suspicion that Golubeva had acted as the main go-between, tentative discussions ongoing for well over a month.
Valentin was keen to argue that to have done nothing would have led to a breakup of the Russian Federation and some form of political or military coup had become inevitable; he also claimed there was no actual leader, with each of the five having an equal say, their individual areas of expertise ensuring that together they offered a coherent whole, one with the determination to push through change and create a more robust and unified Russia.
Grebeshkov was sceptical at best, unsure whether Valentin was being naive or merely optimistic.
While the news outlets similarly hedged their bets, social media sites were far more enthusiastic, an online survey suggesting that some eighty percent of Russians supported the aims of the coup, although slightly less than half agreed with the means.
Moscow's streets remained quiet, the curfew just about holding, many people still coming to terms with the dramatic events of earlier that day.
August 14 was now concentrating its cyber-attacks and insidious rhetoric on other Russian cities, primarily Kaliningrad, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk in south-west Siberia.
The secessionists had gained full control of Yakutsk, and were on the offensive in a dozen other cities.

He was from Lake Havasu City, Arizona, which information he thought should be sufficient to explain why he was in Fivespot right now.
"Been 120 degrees down there all summer," he said, shaking his head.
Not too many folks stayed there in the summer; most of the population were what he called snowbirds, people who just pulled their vehicles into the RV park in November or December and stayed all winter.
In the summer they all scattered to the mountains or the north.
It was beautiful down there in the winter, though, and the population tripled or something like that in the winter months.
Used to be a quiet place, when he moved there 25 years ago, but not any more.
Traffic!
You wouldn't believe it, out there in the middle of the desert.
You'd have to wait 10 minutes at an intersection!
But in the summer it was real quiet.
His wife was one of the few who stayed.
"Seems like she just prefers her own house and her own bed."
He didn't linger on the subject of his wife.
"That town's all about the lake - didn't even exist until they got the lake.
And then they got that London Bridge, you know.
It's their claim to fame.
You ever seen that?
They bought the whole bridge and took it apart and moved it over to the desert, and set it up again.
It's really something.
Golf courses and palm trees, and then London Bridge."
