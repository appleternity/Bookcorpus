In the  inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in.  Similarly, most inheriting frames profile only the Affected entity, not the full Effect situation which is often incorporated into the frame or the particular target.  So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).  'He made me angry.'

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable.

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

"Yes.
I'm furious, thank you for asking.
I'm walking the rest of the way to the zoo.
Just go back to your job."
"What - If I left you to walk all the way there I wouldn't be doing my job.
Get back in the car!"
he shouted, reaching his hand out to her.
She scowled.
"I don't need some wannabe cop who's trying to get with the caretaker of a woman he just recently accused of murder, driving me around like I'm some sort of helpless child!"
she said, beginning to walk off towards the exit.
Roland jolted forward around the car towards her, but stopped when she turned around to face him again.
"Okay, okay.
Look - I'm sorry.
Please?
Just get back in the car okay?
I won't talk to you the rest of the way if you just get back in the car."
"No.
You just want to meet Fran.
And I'm not going to let her talk to some pretentious snobby little-" "Whoa!
You have got some serious anger management issues.

He shook his head sadly.
What would someone want with it?
Teenagers' high jinks were getting worse nowadays.
Mindless thefts weren't the only thing worrying Mr Davis lately.
Spring should have been here by now, bringing the friendly sun along with her, yet it was raining again for the seventh day in a row.
England had always been a wet country, but this was ridiculous.
In response rain fell harder and harder till it seemed to attack the groaning earth.
Huge clouds of wet mud rose up, splattering the building, almost reaching higher windows.
Soon the place may flood.
Drains couldn't cope and his school couldn't afford to repair them.
Lost in such thoughts, Mr Davis jumped in surprise as the door burst open.
Lawrence stood there swaying.
His face was pale and sweaty.
The breathless boy breathed heavily, holding his chest.
Now they were out of danger Lucy sat down in the corner.
"Are you alright Lawrence?"
Mr Davis said, screwing his eyes up in concern.
Lawrence didn't look well at all.
His clothes were soaked through and thick with mud.
His clenched fist held a scruffy piece of paper tightly.
