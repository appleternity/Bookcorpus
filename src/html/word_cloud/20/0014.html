This frame is used for LUs that do not belong in daughter frames, either because they are too general to have any particular image schema associated with them (e.g., here.adv), or because we do not (yet) have a specific frame with the correct image schema (e.g., inland.a).  Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).  In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:  'This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.'  There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.  In some very specific situations, prepositions, adjectives, and nouns can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:  'Inside my wallet is where I put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .'

        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Or they could try to string together several weeklong summer camps--all of them expensive, with few need-based scholarships, and ill-suited to Jonah's interests and background.
Or she could tap all her available church resources in an attempt to put together an ad hoc program of individual tutoring and care that would probably end up being little more than glorified (and volunteer-intensive) babysitting.
Beyond the Summer Learning Program, there were no opportunities suited to Jonah's skills and needs.
The taste of disappointment and frustration lingered in her mouth along with the dust from the road and the stale humid air as she knocked at Mrs. Brackett's door.
That all disappeared the moment Jonah opened the door and without a word or even glance up pushed his face into her turquoise polo shirt and wrapped his arms around her waist.
Becca wanted to both laugh and cry but did neither as she gazed down at the dark curly hair on his perfectly round skull.
She whispered, "My dear Jonah," and patted his head lightly.
Jonah finally pushed away and looked up at her with bright eyes and a big smile.
"Me-me-maw say she has a paper for you."
He turned and loped into the dim house.
Becca followed slowly.
"Mrs.
Brackett?"
"Come in, dear," Mrs. Brackett said from her seat in the chair in front of the dark T.V. Becca shut the door behind her and walked toward the woman.
The kitchen chair she'd pulled over two days earlier was still there beside the upholstered chair.
She walked to it and asked, "May I?"
"Please, dear."
Becca sat down.
Jonah had disappeared, so she focused her attention on Mrs. Brackett.
"He's back," she said in a sudden swell of emotion that made her voice crack.

"What is your name?"
"Freddy.
Freddy Wilder."
"Very well, Freddy.
Follow me."
Lodran turned and left the alley, hearing his new student scramble to follow.
"Where are we goin'?"
"Back to the shop.
Don't worry, I'll make sure you can explain yourself to Chelinn.
Worst that happens, he'll tell you to leave town on your own.
He's not bloodthirsty, he won't kill you if he doesn't think you're a threat.
"Now, here's your first lesson in the Silent Art: your clothes are all wrong.
Your pants are too tight, they won't let you move freely.
Your shoes would be good for indoor work; but for the street, you need a good pair of boots that can conceal a knife.
Your jacket has too many insignia--" "Too many what?"
"Those things."
Lodran tapped several patches.
"They give enemies a way to recognize you.
You need to be plain, to blend into a crowd.
Blue is not a good color, either.
