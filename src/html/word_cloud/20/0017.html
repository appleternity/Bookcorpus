        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Word-Cloud Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            Notice that the words in the word-cloud shows the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            In this HIT, you will see two story snippets. <span class="highlight">Please read both of the stories carefully.</span>

            <br/><br/>
            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see the word-cloud representations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
            These three word clouds jointly represent one of the stories you just read. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="highlight">Please try your best to select the story that refers to the word-cloud representation.</span>

Tarne reacted as if he just joined the conversation.
"Wait?
If you like."
"Good, good," Sesom wandered away.
He stopped with his back to David's ship, staring out at a section of empty space.
"We agree."
And then he half turned.
For a moment it seemed he would say more, but instead he walked straight into the mehltrom.
After he'd gone Tarne stayed quiet.
Mab asked, "Where are your nephews?"
"We didn't include them.
Sesom felt they would bias the decision.
And I didn't think I'd need them.
I thought you..."
Mab braced himself.
Tarne had a way.
He used to get anything he wanted from his traders, when he oversaw the market in Usalm.
And he was most powerful when he was kind.
"It's just that I don't know any man more devoted to his family," Tarne went on.
"How do you stand it?"

What else can we do?"
"What if you produced the evidence and went to see him again?
Seeing pictures might change his attitude.
Offer to leave the CDC and go show them to his wife, if he has one."
"He has one alright, they are socialite elites in Atlanta and he is a pillar of the black community there.
He's a staunch Obama supporter, which I don't understand.
How could a veteran support that guy over a war hero?"
It was a rhetorical question and nobody tried to answer.
"That's actually not a bad idea, if he wants to see his brother elected president he'll need to play ball with us.
Either that or it will be on the front page of the Atlanta Journal Constitution and all that he's worked for to build that socialite reputation will be in the ground.
Good idea Steve, I better get moving on that.
I want to bring you with me Myron, you can help me get the message across to our brother."
"What about the testing?
Do you want us to start without you?
We didn't take the injections last week, slipped my mind."
"Oh yeah, let's get the doc over here and then we can take off."
Steve was impressed, didn't think they'd have a medical doctor on the team.
Robert made a call from his cell, told the man it was urgent and said "I guess an hour will be ok."
"He'll be here in a bit, has a couple of patients to see first.
Are you ready?
