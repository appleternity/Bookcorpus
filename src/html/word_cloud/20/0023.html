Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'

            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that we generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            For example, a "word-cloud representation of nouns" is a group of nouns that might occur, or are semantically relevant, in a story snippet.
            <span class="highlight">Note that the words in the word-cloud show the concept of the story so the words will not necessarily appear in the story.</span>

She got the rope free, pushed it off the tower, and jumped to the ladder.
She slid down and collided with the local at the ladder's midpoint, but a boot to the shoulder knocked him into the bushes and cleared the way for her to continue to the ground.
"Start the winch, Ms. Graus," cried the captain.
"But you aren't in the--" "Now, Ms. Graus!"
She yanked the lever, and the slack in the chains began to reel in.
The captain appeared and dragged out some boards from the floor of the boat to form a ramp.
He led the mule right into the gig and off the other side, dragging the whole of the wagon over the low edge of the boat and straddling it.
He unhooked the mule, scrambled aboard the wagon, and helped Butch to do the same.
Lil sprinted by, heading for the other tower.
The remaining two crew climbed aboard the wagon as winches began to groan and haul the precarious pile from the ground.
Gunner aimed his overly complicated pistol.
"You're going to want to cover your ears.
This one's got one hell of a report," Gunner said.
A crowd of pursuers descended on the beach.
Gunner pulled the trigger.
The sound was remarkable, more like a cannon than a revolver.
It was enough to convince the mob to dive for cover.
"Is this the way supply stops usually go for you people?"
Nita called down.
"On the Lags?

If she felt any emotion, it didn't show on her face.
"Something didn't go right?"
Will asked, reluctantly stepping towards Lena.
The blonde flinched, and Will stopped.
He pressed the piece of shirt harder to his neck and realized he'd better stay as far from the blonde as he could.
A bleeding neck was too much of a temptation, even though Will could see her fangs weren't extended like he'd seen Lena's before.
"I don't understand," the blonde whispered, and Will tried not to gawk.
She suddenly looked so vulnerable and frail.
A hint of emotion shone on her face and made Will see her for the first time as something other than a monster.
Really, she was gorgeous.
He was too preoccupied by being frightened of her to see it before, but the soft nest of golden hair framed her other-worldly face and as her big, icy eyes gazed at the lump of Lena on the floor, she seemed sad.
Then she looked at him again, and Will couldn't see her beauty anymore.
She was a monster again, and seemed on the verge of tearing his throat out at any minute.
The blonde stepped back from Lena and turned away from her.
Though she didn't say anything, somehow moments later, another vampire entered the room.
Will knew this was her boyfriend.
They took each other's hands as soon as they could and stood closer than friends would.
If they were talking out loud only for his sake, Will was surprised.
That the boyfriend didn't look so scary was a miracle.
But there wasn't time to consider these things.
