The Goal is a state of the world that does not currently hold but which the Agent wants to realize and is planning and/or working towards. In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talking about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .' 'The object of the tutorial is to help a student concentrate on his writing skills ' ' The prime goal of the programme was to help develop processes of scientific thinking in children .' 'My goal in this book is to introduce the reader to Web programming applications.'

And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

These involve cases describing the extent of an action\'s, event\'s, or person\'s effect ("his influence on her work was massive"), as well as those related to events ("big party"), similarity ("gigantic difference"), communication ("giant misunderstanding"), and emotions ("great joy", "little joys").  Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. "giant electronics company") and those describing sound volume ("in a tiny voice", "the enormous thundering of her heart").  \'\'  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a.

Gem said.
"Here's hoping."
I pounded on the door, and we stood back and looked again at the camera.
I thrust the sign right in front of the camera again.
An intercom clicked.
"Dr.
Chatsworth, is that you?"
Hemp's eyes brightened.
"Uh, yes, it is.
Who is that, please?"
"It's Max, Dr. Chats - I mean, Max Romero!"
"Max, God it's good to hear your voice.
Can you allow us to come in?
What's the situation inside?"
"Jesus, Dr. Chatsworth.
I can't tell you how happy I am you're here.
I'm ... well, I'm locked inside one of the labs right now.
Some of our people were infected, and I barely made it in here.
Jesus, Dr.  Franklin Lang - or what used to be Dr. Lang - attacked me.
And what the hell was that noise?
About ten minutes ago I heard a loud rumbling sound and the ground actually shook beneath my feet!"
Gem spoke up.
"A passenger plane crashed outside and slid into your building number one.
It was an enormous explosion."
"Jesus.
I was on the phone with Dr. Snipes and Dr. Wilder.
They were in building one working on some documentation.
I guess they're ..."
"They're gone, I'm afraid," said Gem.
"That building is rubble, and what's not destroyed is burning.
I'm sorry."
The smoke was beginning to build where we stood, and it was getting thick and hard to breathe.
There was a light breeze blowing the smoke and fumes in our direction, and along with the wind created by the fire itself, I knew we couldn't stay out here for long.
I tried to be tolerant as Hemp got a feel for the landscape of things.
Hemp looked at us and shook his head.
"They weren't exactly friends, but I did work closely with Dr. Lang.
He was an excellent scientist.
Max, do you have control of the door switch from there?"
"Yes, Dr. Chatsworth, I can buzz the door from here, but you have to be careful.
I see you've got weapons, and that's good, because at this point, I have no idea what you'll find in the unsecured areas of the building."
"What of the EIS staff?"
Hemp asked.
He turned to us and said "Epidemic Intelligence Service.
These are the ones to get busy when a new threat appears."
He looked again at the camera.
"Have any of them been able to initiate an analysis of this?"
I was getting impatient.
"I hate to interrupt Hemp, but would you mind if he buzzes us in?
We're pretty exposed out here."
Gem spoke up.
"Flex, we'd better get as much information as we can before we go inside.
Hemp's talking to him now, but once we gain access, we have no idea what we're going to run into or if we'll ever get to him at all."
She looked up at the camera and shrugged.
"Sorry, Max, but there's no guarantee we'll make it to you or that you'll be alive if and when we do get there."
"I understand," Max said.
"What else can I tell you, Dr. Chatsworth?"
"Can you tell me if the abnormals - that's what we're calling them for the time being - are concentrated or more prevalent in a particular area of the building?
So we can avoid it if possible?"
The click came again.
"This started yesterday evening," said Max.
"I was having some dinner in the cafeteria, and it seemed as though after some initial complaints about headaches - severe, migraine-type  headaches from what I understand - those who had them just dropped.
Like they passed out.
When they got back up, they'd ... well, they'd just changed.
Eyes, skin, motor skills."
"That fast," said Hemp.
"Reminds me of what I saw in the Tallahassee police station.
I'd seen some of them farther along outside, which is why I went in for help.
But inside the police station, everything was chaos.
I went in for help, and ended up ... well, you know."
Max came on again.
"Two of the cafeteria staff attacked Dr. Hanzek, and I sat there holding a sandwich in the back of the room, not sure what was happening.
Then I saw they were trying to eat him, and he was screaming.
But Dr. Chatsworth, they weren't just trying.
They were eating him."
Max spoke rapidly, and I felt for him.
He was the first uninfected we'd come across, and this is what we were all feeling.
A sense of dread and confusion about what was happening to the world as we had known it.
"I just got up and ran.
That's when I almost collided with Dr. Lang, who looked the same as the others.
I didn't notice at first, I was so in shock from what had just happened.
I started to say something to him, but it was clear he was gone.
He grabbed my shirt and I tried to pull his arm off me, and his skin ... it was mushy or something.
His eyes were vapid, nothing there, but I got the impression he could still see me.
I was able to fight my way free of him, and I just ran in here and activated the lock."
Hemp looked worried.
"Max, how long has the generator been running?"
Click.
"About sixteen hours now.
But it feeds from multiple huge underground LP tanks, so it can literally run for a couple of weeks."
"Good," Hemp said.
"If it shuts down, the door locks release.
Max, when's the last time you heard noise from outside the lab where you are?"
"Not since about six hours ago.
There's a small refrigerator in here, so I've got some food and water, but no weapons.
I wasn't willing to venture outside here and check the status."
I spoke.
"There's evidence that some of the abnormals made it outside, but we don't know where they came from.
Hemp?
Do you think you have everything you need for now?"
He nodded.
"Yes, I believe so.
Max, we're going to come in now, so activate the lock release.
Which lab are you in?
We'll try to get to you first."
"Second level, lab 202.
I don't think I'd recommend taking the elevator.
You won't know what you'll be facing when the doors open, but I'll leave that to you.
Top of the stairs, right hallway, 2nd door on the left."
"Okay, hit it.
We'll be there as soon as we can."
The solenoid hummed and the bolt retracted.
We pulled the door open and went inside.
*****
We stepped inside and looked in both directions.
I felt better with a death grip on one of the several Daewoo K7s we'd confiscated, and Hemp was trying out one of the three Heckler and Koch MP5s we'd nabbed.
The H&K was the most widely used submachine gun among law enforcement, and looked pretty badass besides.
Nice and compact, with a 30-round magazine and a 2-round burst setting, Hemp had a full magazine installed and two jammed in his belt.
Gem brought up the rear with Trina in her arms.
She looked exhausted, and I knew she'd never say anything.
I knew from experience that Trina, despite weighing only about 40 pounds, could start to feel very heavy after hauling her around for just a short while.
"Baby, are you okay with carrying her?"
I asked.
Gem nodded, but pulled back and looked at Trina.
"Trini, baby, do you think you'd like to walk and hold Gemmy's hand for a little while?"
"Uh huh," she said.
"I can walk.
Where are we?"
"We're in a big building, and we're going to a laboratory to see friend of Hemp's."
Gem put her down and she looked up at us and held out her hand.
Gem took it.
"I'm not tired," she said, yawning.
"I know you're not, baby.
You don't get tired because you're a big girl."
I smiled at Gem.
"Stay about eight to ten feet behind us.
If anything's up here, we'll dispatch it before you two know what happened."
"Stairwell's on the left here.
Or do you want to take the elevator?"
asked Hemp.
Unlike most buildings with backup power systems, this facility had a large generator capable of running nearly every piece of powered equipment that might ordinarily operate, with the exception of some minor, non-essential devices.
As Hemp told us on the road, they could have to survive in this building for some time, and the capability to continue the experiments necessary to find an antidote to any given virus or infection was crucial.
"I think your friend might be right," I said.
"Let's forget the elevator.
We can push the doors open and get the lay of the land.
That way we can avoid the 'Here's Johnny!' factor and enter at our own speed."
"Stairwell's here," Hemp said.
He pulled open the door to the left of the entry.
Steel corrugated steps led up to the second level in two flights.
Hemp craned his neck, pointing his gun up the well.
We could see through the steel stair treads, and it appeared to be deserted.
