'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.'

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Front_for', 'tfidf': 1.2465598583221436, 'lexical_unit': 'front.n / blind.n / front.v', 'definition': "An individual or organization, the Front, serves as a cover for an Illicit_activity or an Illicit_organization.  'The laundromat is a front for the Yakuza.'"}, {'frame': 'Cause_motion', 'tfidf': 1.239782452583313, 'lexical_unit': 'shove.v / roll.v / force.v', 'definition': 'An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

He turned to his laptop and entered www.google.com.
The familiar web search engine appeared.
He thought for a moment.
What to search for?
He entered "Claw" not knowing what was his first name.
The responses were too many.
Forget that, he thought, I'll be here forever.
Then he thought again.
He hesitated for a moment withdrawing his hands from the keyboard.
Why not?
He typed, "Mount Dora murders."
Another list of responses appeared.
Slowly, he glanced down the different options.
Jesse read, Ira Lefkoff finally convicted of murder after three years...
He selected this option and a new site appeared on the screen from the local Mount Dora Newspaper.
Jesse read on.
Ira Lefkoff, age 77, found guilty of six murders.
Victims frightened to death.
How does a 77-year-old man scare someone to death?
Ira Lefkoff, retired, moved from Chicago after working thirty-five-years as a candy sales representative for Hershey's.
The first murder took place in front of his home at the bus stop, the others in the same manner every six months.
Evidence inside the convicted murderer's house proved that Ira Lefkoff was obsessed with fright tactics.
Investigators found articles, movies and journal descriptions of how he committed the murders.
All six victims suffered from heart attacks.
Families and friends of the victims were satisfied with the jury's deliberation.
The convicted testified that he did not commit any of the accused crimes.
He repeatedly vocalized that he was framed.
Ira Lefkoff was found later that afternoon dead in his cell.
Autopsy report revealed that Ira Lefkoff suffered a heart attack and died from fear.
"Weird," whispered Jesse.
He looked around the room, feeling watched.
The boxes were still at the top of the stairs but by tomorrow morning they would be gone.
Not this time, Jesse thought, this time I'm going to catch you.
However, the truth was that he was hoping that nothing would happen.
The truth was that Jesse was hoping that tomorrow morning the boxes would still be there and that all this was nothing more than a mistake.
Jesse was feeling restless after spending too many hours stuck inside Alivan's Wizards and Witches Corner Store.
He peered out the window again hoping to see something or someone that would distract him, but it was still dark and quiet.
He glanced at his cell phone, nothing.
Jesse stretched and yawned with such intensity that he thought it would never end.
He pushed the keyboard aside, crossed his arms on the desk, and laid his head down.
Just ten minutes, he thought to himself.
Jesse was abruptly awakened when he heard something outside.
He apprehensively looked around the store.
The boxes were still in their place.
He heard it again, shuffling, struggling.
Jesse looked out the window.
Everything was still.
Even the laptop went into sleep mode.
Then he heard it again, it came from outside the front door.
Jesse froze.
He anxiously observed the door as the handle slowly turned.
It turned to the left and then to the right, then a slight push but the door was locked.
It must be Mr. Claw, thought Jesse.
I got him.
I'm going to be the one able to identify Mr. Claw.
I solved the mystery.
Jesse rose from his chair and slowly made his way to the front door.
Cautiously, he spread apart the window blind and took a quick look.
Jesse saw nothing.
Strange, he thought.
He reached down and gripped the door handle and with the other unlocked the bolted lock.
The hanging bell rang slowly, mysteriously.
Jesse slowly opened the door and found a man standing before him in the dark.
His heart was beating through his chest as he turned the porch lights on.
An elderly man with sunken eyes and dressed in striped prison clothes faced him.
He stepped forward awkwardly, reaching out zombie-like.
Jesse stepped back.
He moved deathlike towards Jesse.
Jesse could feel his heart beating in his ears.
He didn't know how to react.
The old man stood only inches from Jesse, and opened his mouth.
Stale breath rushed over Jesse's face.
The old man opened his mouth wider and wider.
Shrieks and howls filled the room as the mouth grew and grew.
Jesse tried to move but he was too scared.
The man's teeth, stained and rotted passed the top of Jesse's head.
Jesse shuddered.
The old man's mouth completely covered Jesse's head.
Jesse yelled and yelled and yelled.
Jesse fell from his chair and woke up, his heart still beating rapidly.
The answering machine followed crashing upon the hard wood floor.
It took him a few minutes to calm down and realize that he was experiencing a terrible nightmare.
Jesse quickly rose to his feet and looked around the room, and up the stairs.
The boxes were gone.
Chapter 7 Wednesday
Jesse locked the front door with his key, still perplexed that the boxes were missing.
It was unexplainable, and yet they were missing.
He searched the entire store for them unsuccessfully.
With nothing more to do, he decided to go home.
"Did you hear it?"
The tight grip on his shoulder startled Jesse making him jump.
"Did you hear it?"
The homeless man repeated as he drew uncomfortably close to Jesse's face.
Jesse backed away climbing down the steps.
The homeless man followed.
"Hear what?"
"That raving mad laughter!"
The homeless man covered his ears as his hands trembled.
"The same laughter I heard before all those people were murdered."
"You saw who killed them?"
"I found them dead!"
Jesse stepped further away.
"I would hear the laughter and come out."
The homeless man pointed to the dark alley.
"They would be dead.
I told the police that it wasn't Mr. Lefkoff.
He was too kind - - always giving me something to eat.
It was him, the stranger with the laugh always telling me insane stories to torture me."
"Who?"
Jesse drew closer.
"I don't know, but he knows that I know.
He knows!"
"Did you tell the police?"
"He said he would kill me...he knows that I know!
He knows that I know...he knows!"
The homeless man lunged forward barely missing Jesse and rushed across the street disappearing back into the dark alley.
Jesse tossed and turned in bed all night.
Every time he closed his eyes hoping to fall asleep, he would repeatedly envision the horrific dream.
It was enough to make anyone die of a heart attack.
He could still feel his heart throbbing in his head, and his hands cold and clammy.
The other option was to stay up all night and figure out how the boxes were moved.
It was impossible.
No one was able to get in or out of Alivan's Wizards and Witches Corner Store without passing in front of his counter.
Even if he had fallen asleep, he would have heard the door bells ring as the front door opened, and it was impossible for anyone to come in through the back door because not only was it locked, the amount of junk piled up against it would require effort and time to move.
Over and over, Jesse replayed the events of the evening in his head, and each time he failed to come up with one reasonable explanation for how the boxes disappeared.
He searched the entire store.
He even went as far as to try to enter Mr. Claw's office.
Although hesitant, he knocked on the office door, and when there was no response, he listened against the door for any sign of movement.
All was silent.
Determined, Jesse tried to open the door, but it was locked.
It was useless.
The morning sun was rising slowly, casting soft shadows across the floor and walls.
It was Wednesday, four days before Halloween, and three days before the annual Halloween festival.
It was going to be a busy day for sure.
So Jesse decided to make an early start of it.
Not that he was in a rush to return to work, but on the way he could stop by the Deli and speak to Cindy.
The Mount Dora Annual Halloween Festival was a very profitable fundraiser sponsored by local organizations to help raise money for needy causes.
Recently, it attracted tourists from the main city who enjoyed escaping the hustle and bustle for the weekend.
Alivan's Witches and Wizards Corner Store was in the perfect place at the perfect time to service everyone seeking last minute costumes for the event.
That was enough to cause Jesse to be stressed out.
He didn't need to add on top of his work pressure a secret agent wizard out to stop a mad wizard.
Jesse heard a low beep coming from his cell phone as he threw on a clean shirt.
He walked around his bed to his dresser where he plugged his cell phone last night to charge.
"Meet me for breakfast at the same place."
It was a text message from the wizard Beifar.
He's Okay, thought Jesse, somewhat relieved.
"You buying?"
Jesse responded.
***
