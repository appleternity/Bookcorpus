The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Residence', 'tfidf': 0.9845236539840698, 'lexical_unit': 'lodge.v / resident.n / occupant.n', 'definition': "This frame has to do with people (the Residents) residing in Locations, sometimes with a Co-resident.

The Body_part of the Victim which is most directly affected may also be mentioned in the place of the Victim.  In such cases, the Victim is often indicated as a genitive modifier of the Body_part, in which case the Victim FE is indicated on a second FE layer. '' 'Rod saw his father beating his mother.'  'In the end Wormtongue is fed up with being beaten so he cuts Saruman's throat to free himself.'  'A mother stabbed to death by her husband made a secret will stating that he must never be allowed to care for their son.'"}, {'frame': 'Change_position_on_a_scale', 'tfidf': 0.977573037147522, 'lexical_unit': 'shift.v / swing.v / reach.v', 'definition': 'This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item\'s position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise.

The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Come the rains the dirt would produce a nasty quagmire.
Chauncey looked on in horror.
He could see at a glance there was no decent fodder for Shastra.
If Shastra was here she must be very unwell and unhappy he thought.
'How could anyone do such harm to this once beautiful valley?'
Lac shook his head.
He had no experience with people like this, people who seemed to enjoy destroying nature's beauty.
Of course, Lac had never known bandits either.
No bandit would come near a village which boasted a fine magical academy.
He wondered just what kind of mind would allow for this depravity.
It was the first time in Lac's life that he was confronted with an enigma and yet he understood it wasn't as such an enigma.
Yes, it was out of place in his conception of the world but it was not out of place in the world.
Was it something inherent in some people?
Or maybe it was that something important was missing from how they thought or reasoned.
Lac heard Chauncey shudder and he turned to the unicorn.
Tears were starting to form at the corners of his large brown eyes.
'Lac, save my tears in the cup the farmers gave you.'
Lac hurriedly unslung his rucksack and pulled out the rough hewn ceramic cup.
Tears, large almost white tears, cascaded down the unicorns face.
Lac tried his best to collect the tears.
He filled the cup to the brim.
After a while Chauncey stopped weeping.
A number tears fell to the ground.
As the unicorn tears were absorbed shoots of green and tender grass grew.
Lac didn't notice this as he was looking at Chauncey.
He was concerned for his friend.
"Are you okay Chauncey?"
'I believe I will be.' "What should I do with this cup?"
'Put it aside for a moment and let us ponder a strategy.'
Lac dug out a little spot on the hillside and placed the cup in it.
He and the unicorn now returned to look over the ridge and contemplated.
It was obvious there would be no way to enter the area without being seen.
There was absolutely no cover.
"Maybe we should go down there at night?"
Chauncey remained silent.
What they were looking at was a poorly constructed, long clapboard structure which contained the kitchen and sleeping quarters of the bandits.
It was much wider than its width and nestled against the slope in the back of the valley.
It had two chimneys and both were emitting copious amounts of smoke.
On the far side of the valley there was a corral and a small barn for the horses.
An unhitched wagon was in front of the corral.
On the near side next to the house was a closed lean-to with a small fenced yard in front of it.
They were nearly a mile from the lean-to.
'She's there.'
Lac did not bother to ask if he was certain.
He knew Chauncey would not make a mistake.
'She senses me.
Her magic is getting stronger.'
Lac looked to the cleared area behind and above the ranch house.
"If there were boulders up there maybe we could cause an avalanche.' 'That is not a bad idea Lac.' "But there aren't any boulders."
Chauncey was quite for a spell then, 'still, your idea has merit.'
Lac sighed.
Merit?
Not without a whole pile of boulders.
"Where do you think they're keeping the girl?"
'I would have to say she is prisoner in the ranch house.'
Actually Lac had already surmised that.
The problem was how to get her out of the ranch house and away from the bandits.
"How many bandits do you think there are?"
'Five bandits arrived on horseback and one on that horse pulled thing...' "A wagon."
'Yes.
I perceive another two horses in the barn so that would be eight.' "We can't fight all eight of them."
Chauncey had long ago come to that realization.
"Chauncey could you...the problem is when we rescue Shastra the bandits will come out of the house."
'You could rescue Esme while I rescue my mate.' "If they're chasing you how would I and Esme escape?"
'Hmm.
I see the problem.' "Chauncey I think we're gonna have to split up.
Maybe I could rescue Shastra if she would consent for me to ride her and you could rescue Esme?"
'Lac that is not bad.
Shall we ponder together and refine your idea?'
They did so ponder as the afternoon grew late.
'We should attempt it just before it gets dark.' "But Chauncey are you sure?
What if...?"
'I have faith in you Lac.' "That's all well and good but it's you who'll be injured if you're wrong."
'At least Shastra will be rescued.'
There was no more time to argue.
They must be in position before it got too dark.
Entertaining some misgivings Lac rode atop Chauncey just below the ridge.
The plan they decided on was that Lac would take Shastra out of the lean-to and up into a swale between the end of the ridge which met the long slope above the ranch house.
Chauncey would position himself right behind the room where Esme was being held.
As Lac waited he was filled with anxiety: what if I cannot...but there are no boulders there...what if Chauncey gets the wrong room?...what if Chauncey is injured...or worse?
And there it was.
That voice again; attitude, attitude.
The refrain would not go away.
Lac was never as scared at this moment than at any time in his life.
***
The dragon awoke.
He awoke hungry and he awoke with a big smile.
He could sense much magic.
Much closer now.
It was time.
The magic meals were not far he knew if he could sense them so strongly.
A dragon's mind is not one given to introspection yet he wondered why there would be two such strong magicks near all of a sudden.
Since he had no answer he promptly forgot the question.
He rose in the dwarven made cavern.
He was impressive he knew and wished other dragons were around to be envious of him.
Dragons are very vain and narcissistic.
He looked about him and was very pleased with his lair.
He did a mental inventory.
Everything was fine.
He was one of the largest of his kind.
His kind of dragon was the kind which could breathe fire.
And his first stomach was ready for some serious combustion.
If dragons could laugh he would have.
Instead he worked his muscles to get ready for flight.
He expanded his chest and the fire grew within.
He let out a small stream out his nostrils for a test.
It'd been years after all.
But the dragon was satisfied.
He let out a large blast and the area which had once been the gate to the outside world melted.
He moved his bulk to the opening and looked out.
It wasn't dark yet.
His little brain considered that.
Being black and going up against two magicks, one a unicorn, made him think he should wait for nightfall.
He had no problem with that.
The dragon laid down on the edge of the portal.
He knew the reward for waiting would be well worth it.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Lac slipped off Chauncey's back carefully so not to spill the unicorn's tears.
Finding his way down the swale to the lean-to was not arduous given that only scraggly bushes unfit for even kindling dotted the hillside.
Of course, tree stumps littered the whole valley, the sides of the hills and the slope to the rear of the ranch house.
The only difficulty would be if one or more of the bandits left the ranch house and walked to the lean-to or even looked up the swale as Lac descended.
Or, happen to notice a large white unicorn carefully picking his way across the slope above the bandits' dwelling.
Yet, as Lac neared the lean-to he could smell the cook fires.
Or more precisely smell what was being cooked.
He realized it must be near the bandits' dinner time and breathed more easily.
Lac at first thought he'd go behind the lean-to and make his presence known.
But when he was still some twenty yards from the structure he heard in his head, 'who are you?'
Lac quickly looked to where Chauncey was working his way through the tree stumps on the slope.
He was not paying any attention to Lac.
Must be Shastra.
"You can hear me and are you Shastra?"
'Yes to both.
You are not that stealthy...for a human sneaking up to me.' "I've come to rescue you.
I'm Lac a friend of Chauncey."
'He is here...oh, I thought so but I was afraid to believe it.
It has been so long.
So very long.' "I'll be there in just a minute...hold on."
Lac moved with more confidence.
He understood that unicorns had greater hearing than humans and he assumed that the bandits were too interested in their coming supper for the little noise he made.
He reached the back of the lean-to and was shielded from any cursory look from the ranch house.
The lean-to was built poorly and he looked between boards nominally called a wall to locate Shastra.
He almost dropped Chauncey's tears.
He was silent and hoped he wouldn't cry.
He whispered, "what have they done to you?"
He really was only talking to himself.
'They have not treated me well though I suppose they have not really harmed me either.'
Lac saw the bandits had placed a large cone, what appeared to be made of iron, attached to the head of Shastra.
Her legs were hobbled.
The whiteness he had come to associate with unicorns was not present.
She was mottled and mangy.
