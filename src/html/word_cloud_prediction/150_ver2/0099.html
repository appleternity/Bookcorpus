There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'

This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Certainly one possible explanation for werewolves, and tales of magical transformations.
His grin broadened.
"Well, I told him the were-people of the Earth had a pact to help each other, and that you were in trouble already, for letting someone like him know we exist.
I told him you were were-mer, and that I--" She couldn't suppress the snort of laughter that came.
"Were...mer?
That's..."
She laughed.
"That's brilliant."
"Thank you.
I thought so....
Anyway, I told him I was a were-tiger" "A were-tiger?"
She couldn't help the grin that came.
The man certainly was inventive.
The grin evaporated when he shrugged and added, "I think he bought it....
We'll have to see what happens, and be careful."
"And his camera?"
"In the cabin.
It's a digital model.
I not only erased the pictures, I took new ones over them, then erased them, too, to be sure there's nothing he can recover.
I said you'd leave the camera at the front gate when you went to work."
"Umm...can I interrupt for just a second?"
Skip Daws stood on the deck of the Harpfish, drying his hair with a towel.
When he saw he had their attention he said, "When you're done talking do you think you might let me in on the big secret?
Like what the hell is going on with Ann and her..."
he glanced around, apparently checking for eavesdroppers, before saying, "Well, whatever that was that I saw?"
She turned to David, in question.
He gave a little shrug, as though to say, "It's up to you."
So she said, "Come have breakfast with us Skip, and I'll tell you about it."
Everyone else seemed to know, or at least find out about it, so what was one more?

Chapter 12
David took the boat out of the slip before they turned in for the night, to continue his drift data-gathering, and to ensure that neither Jones nor any other reporter could find them.
A quiet evening followed devoted to conversation on no particular subject.
She exchanged personal anecdotes, talked politics, and even argued religion without coming to blows.
He showed interest in virtually everything, and had a way of expressing things that seemed to anticipate, and answer her every question.
As teacher he must be an especially good one.
Unfortunately, his profession, other than the generic term, oceanographer, was a subject they had yet to cover.
She made a mental note to ask.
Breakfast was a silent affair.
And that continued, as they headed for the marina.
Tonight she would sleep at Carla's apartment.
As they approached the dock she leaned back against the pilothouse's front wall, enjoying the sunshine and reliving the events of the previous morning, with the reporter.
If only things wouldn't keep getting more and more complicated.
Jones was the first of many.
So, she now had to suspect anything and anyone out of the ordinary.
One of the prices of fame, it appeared, but getting used to it would take time.
David knocked on the pilothouse window to get her attention, then called, "I'll need you at the bow lines.
I'll get the stern."
They were the first words he'd spoken since "Good morning."
Her decision to leave disappointed him, obviously, but living on the boat wasn't a viable option, for several reasons, not the least of which was the effect he had on her.
Looked at in retrospect, last night, with conversation, wine, and coffee had been far too comfortable a way to spend an evening.
The engines rumbled at just above idle speed as they entered the marina and worked their way to their slip.
She stopped at the hatchway before going to the bow, to make ready to secure the lines.
"David?
I'm sorry I've made you unhappy."
"Not your fault," he called, waving the comment away.
"It's just that I've come to enjoy having you here.
I hadn't really known how lonely I was before you came on board.
I guess I was too busy, and too worried about running out of time to think about it.
It's nice to have someone to talk to, though."
Unfortunately, his back was to her so she couldn't see his face.
But taking his attention from maneuvering the boat this close to the slip would be foolish.
He waved her to the deck, saying, "Go.
We'll talk later."
As she walked to the bow the engines ran up the scale for a moment.
The boat came to a stop, then began to back into the slip.
His seamanship was impressive.
The old trawler wasn't terribly agile, but he threaded it between the pilings, compensating for wind and current, until the stern was inches from the dock, then stopped with a tiny burst of power.
She reached out with the gaff to snag the windward mooring line and pull it in, then hauled on the line till the boat was centered in the slip before she tied it off.
She secured the lee side, as well, before making her way to the stern, where David was finishing up.
"I wish I could stay.
I've enjoyed being here.
And I liked our talks, but..."
She shrugged.
So much unsaid.
So much she couldn't say.
"But it won't work with me not in port most of the time.
I know that, but it's..."
He finished securing the line and turned to face her, leaning against the stern trunk.
"I know.
I also know I'm acting like a kid, so I'm sorry.
I don't handle disappointment well, I suppose."
"Who does?"
He smiled at that.
He had such a sweet smile that it never failed to cheer.
"Who indeed?
But the past few months have been a bit out of character for me."
He waved an arm, encompassing the boat and the sea around it, saying, "I love the sea, but this kind of thing isn't exactly what I do for my life's work."
That brought up the subject she'd been planning to ask about, so she said, "What exactly do you do for your life's work?
I know you trained as a marine biologist, but that's all.
We've been so busy discussing my problems that you never really told me about yourself."
"Don't you have to work?"
She smiled.
"Yes, but as the star of the show I do have a few perks, so come have another cup of coffee and we can talk."
"Okay," he said, taking a sip of coffee.
"I graduated from Boston University, and went on to get my doctorate at M.I.T., which has a partnership with Woods Hole.
I took one trip there and fell in love.
I was teaching undergrads at M.I.T. when the job came up at WHOI, which I sort--" "WHOI?"
"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
Sorry.
It's in Falmouth Mass."
When she didn't react to that he added, "It's across the bay from Chappaquiddick, on Martha's Vineyard."
That clicked.
"Ahh...it's a school?"
"A bit of everything.
Woods Hole is he center of the universe for things oceanographic."
"Then you're a teacher?"
That had been her first guess.
"That, too, but my real interest is something that probably won't excite you."
"Try me."
"I'm interested in sensory mechanisms, physiology, and lately I've taken a sidetrack into holographic imaging."
That perked up her interest.
"Really.
That last sounds like something I would like to learn more about.
But that's for later.
Right now I want to know how you went from there to treasure hunting."
That rated a laugh.
"That's easy.
I wanted to be a treasure hunter long before I thought about biology.
Now it's a hobby.
I let it slide for the past few years, though, until Jennie was diagnosed.
It looked like a way to help, so...well, here I am."
He took her cup, along with his, and carried them to the sink, where he poured them out, saying, "And here you go.
I could talk all day.
But I have to get to work and so do you."
Apparently, he didn't want to talk, and she respected that by saying nothing, but as they got in the car, he said, "I'll tell you the rest tonight."
"Tonight?"
He grinned.
"It's unreasonable of you to expect me to do this cold-turkey, so to speak, so we're having dinner.
Okay?
You can bring Carla, if you want."
He headed for the deck, taking the suitcase that contained her clothing.
"Well..."
"Just call me when you're ready," he said over his shoulder.
"You can leave your stuff in the car's trunk.
That way I'll pick you up and deliver your things at the same time, and you don't have to worry about them during the day."
That made sense, so she thanked him and followed as he stepped onto the dock.
"Do you have a ride to Carla's place, or shall I pick you up at the park for dinner?"
Efficiency appeared to be his watchword today.
"Pick me up at Carla's place.
One of the maintenance men takes her up and back every day.
He said I could come, too."
His eyes met hers over the car roof, as he said, "Well, when you're ready, call, okay?
And I meant it about Carla being invited.
Trina, too."
"Umm....
Okay, I suppose.
I'll ask."
But she wouldn't.
She knew that, but wasn't sure why.
