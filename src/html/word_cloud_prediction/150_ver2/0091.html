The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Four of us jump into the car; it's off to town to buy more booze.
Bottle store finished, boot loaded, Andrew says, "why don't we go for a beer?"
I think that's a great idea, soon we're supping a few beers in The Gray's.
Leaving The Gray's, I drive back to the reception.
I'm definitely over the legal limit, I'm pissed.
The night carries on; people dance and get drunk, including my lovely wife.
Time to go; we've booked into a hotel in the centre for the night.
The honeymoon isn't going to be a passionate one, she's too pissed.
Leaving the hotel, I drop Sylvia back in Queens Park.
I need to drop the car back at the rental shop.
Looking at the clock hung on the wall in the rental office, I decide a cup of coffee at Haefelis would be a good idea.
I walk the two blocks to Haefelis, taking a table outside; I'm soon enjoying a cup of strong black coffee.
My head is a little sore today, too much drink last night.
I sit and watch the world go by, well Bulawayo anyway.
For some reason I think about my observations when I sit here.
There are a few ladies sat drinking, they are all wearing dresses or skirts.
They sit with their legs wide open, I've seen this a lot.
Not very ladylike.
I also see a man on the other side of the road, he's dancing.
Africans love to dance anywhere.
I'd finished my coffee a little while ago, run a few errands, now it's time for a beer.
Falling into a chair in The Gray's, I order a Zambezi, this is the hair of the dog.
I feel shit today, bit of a hangover from last night.
A white man asks if he can sit at my table.
I tell him to go ahead.
He took one beer; we talked for forty five minutes, maybe one hour.
He was an interesting man, he was a miner.
"What do you mine?"
I ask him.
"Gold" is his reply.
He told me he has a small mine; he makes a good living from what he does.
Beer finished he leaves.
He had only been gone a few minutes, when in walks Fred.
He keeps me company for another hour with his comments about the black people.
Six months have almost gone by again; my visa will run out soon.
I don't want to travel over the border; I'm going to try something different.
I'm at the immigration offices here in the city.
I ask if I can see the person in charge.
After a few minutes I'm taken out of the main public area.
I'm told to wait outside this office.
A man opens the door, inviting me in.
He's the top man; he's in charge of all immigration issues over this side of the country.
He asks me what he can do for me.
I explain that I've just got married to my Zimbabwean wife.
My visa is nearly over; I would like to spend more time with her.
No problem, we can give you another six months.
Shit this is too easy.
I notice a photo of Liverpool FC on his wall.
I ask him if he supports them.
He tells me that's his team.
"Everyone here in Bulawayo supports Liverpool.
The reason is Bruce Grobbelaar was goalkeeper of the top team here in Bulawayo, Highlanders" We got onto first name terms; I told him my name was Seb.
He in return told me he was Study.
We got on so well we arranged to go to football together the coming weekend.
Study became a good friend, useful too.
Whenever I needed a new visa, I would just go and see him.
We watched a good few games together at Barbour Fields Stadium.
One game I remember was Highlanders against Dynamos.
These games were tribal, not just sport.
Dynamos came from Harare, their supporter base was Shona.
Highlanders were from Bulawayo, their supporter base was Ndebele.
The stadium was full, so full I couldn't see the game.
I watched the police carrying slabs of beer to a place they were congregating.
One policeman walked around looking very menacing, he was carrying the biggest Knobkierrie I had ever seen.
Hit someone on the head with that and you will kill them.
We decided to leave the game early, Study dropping me off home.
On the evening news I watched a story about the game.
There was trouble at the end.
The footage showed a bank of people behind one goal.
The police are on the pitch, they fire tear gas into this crowd of several thousand supporters.
The supporters squeeze to both ends, leaving a big void in the middle.
They are fenced in, there's nowhere for them to go.
Some people died because of the police intervention.
The supporters were from Highlanders.
I also tried to watch another game between these two enemies.
It was the Independence Cup Final in Harare.
The problem here is the admission is free.
Too many people trying to get in.
I made my way up to the first tier; every stairway going into the stands was full with people.
Every now and then they would all run down, some falling and being trampled.
The police were at the top hitting them with sticks.
I tried another tier, same thing.
I left the stadium with out even seeing the pitch.
Reports later were saying, "6 People Die at Football Match".
I'm very glad I didn't stay.
I asked Sylvia if she would like to visit England.
It was the normal muted response, but it was yes.
A bit of work acquiring a visa, we were soon in a position to go to the UK for six months.
~~~~~
Chapter 22 Back in Africa
We had a good six months in England, I think Sylvia enjoyed it.
I managed to get a temporary job for the time we were there, the money was useful.
Now we're back here in Africa, the beautiful city of Bulawayo.
We had a room in Queens Park but neither of us liked it.
From there we moved into a flat on Twelfth Avenue, it wasn't long before we hit problems.
The person was subletting to us, the landlord found out and we were forced to move out.
Now we have found a shared house in the Suburbs.
The Suburbs is about one kilometre from the city centre, just past the parks.
The streets are lined with trees, the houses are very nice.
The place we're living in is a very huge house, there's a large garden.
We have one room, sharing the bathrooms and kitchen with six other people.
The property is a little run down, the gardens overgrown, but you can visualise what it must have been like.
The garden is full of trees and bushes, no grass, just dust or sand.
Today Sylvia tells me she's missed her period, I tell her to go and take a test.
She phones and makes an appointment at the clinic for tomorrow.
Now we have a mobile phone, I bought it here, a second-hand Nokia.
It's quite new technology here, but the Zimbabweans have taken to it with great enthusiasm.
They're never off the thing; you will see them sat in the bars playing with the keys, writing text messages, talking.
The other problem the mobile as created, is an assault on all of the phone booths in the street.
Now it's very difficult to find one that's not been vandalised.
They say the mobile people pay people to do this and then there are no other means of contact, except the mobile phone.
I'm not sure if it's true, but before the mobile came along the phone booths were in superb condition.
Sylvia's gone to the clinic today; I'm walking into the city for breakfast.
She will meet me at The Gray's for some lunch.
A short stroll past the parks, I reach the city centre.
Few more blocks walked and I'm taking a seat at Haefelis.
I order black coffee and croissant, which soon arrives.
I attack my breakfast; they do make a good cup of coffee here.
I watch the usual happenings, the odd madman walking by shouting and talking to himself.
The beautiful black girls pass, look and give a smile.
I'm joined by Steve.
"What are you doing here?"
I ask him.
He tells me he phoned me, Sylvia told him I was here.
She's carrying the phone, I don't like the things.
He just wants to have a chat.
Drinking our coffee I tell him how things are going on.
I tell him Sylvia's gone for a test, she might be pregnant.
Coffee finished, he needs to go back to work.
I have a few things I want to do before I meet Sylvia.
Arriving at The Gray's, I'm flabbergasted, Sylvia's already here.
I go over to her, I make the comment about African time, it falls on deaf ears.
We make an order for food, I want a sandwich, she wants chicken and chips.
I ask her about the test? it's positive, she's pregnant.
I'm happy; this will be my third child, for her, the first.
We take our lunch, making mental notes between us of the things we need to do.
Time passes, I have found a gynaecologist for Sylvia, he's an Australian.
We will use the government hospital, but not the doctors.
The day of arrival he will attend the birth.
Another new development is the house we're staying in is being sublet, we all have to leave.
I've heard that this place is up for sale; I will go and check it out.
The rains have provided instant lawns in the garden.
Where all of the dust was is now grass, it looks so different.
The borehole is dry, that's one of the jobs that would need to be sorted out if I purchased the house.
If you want to keep your garden all year round, you would need the borehole.
The house never happened, the owner who was selling lived in South Africa, he was a white Zimbabwean.
We made an appointment; he never bothered to turn up.
Weeks later the agent called me, the man wanted to see me about the house sale.
My chosen words to her were, "tell him to put it where the sun doesn't shine".
It was a shame really, what you were getting for PS25,000 was a lot of house.
