In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Plants', 'tfidf': 1.2845534086227417, 'lexical_unit': 'tree.n / weed.n', 'definition': 'The LUs in this frame refer to biological entities other than human beings and animals, which are labeled by the FE Plant.'}, {'frame': 'Sensation', 'tfidf': 1.280663013458252, 'lexical_unit': 'fragrance.n / aroma.n / taste.n', 'definition': "This frame contains nouns that refer to sensations in different modalities.

In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

"No." Thane said "Ah."
Nyx gave a short chuckle, forcing Hope to turn her face and meet her burning black gaze.
"This promises to get interesting."
Nyx turned to Thane saying "Let me know how things turn out."
She was gone.
Just as if she had never been standing there.
The only evidence that Hope had not been hallucinating was a sharp pain and blood from where Nyx' fingernail had pierced her skin, dripping down her cheek.
Thane walked to Hope, lifting his hand to wipe the blood from her face.
Before she could stop his hand from touching her, he grabbed her wrist, bringing her palm to his lips, kissing it softly.
It was sexual and yet completly chaste all at once.
He was shaking, Hope knew it was not from the cold.
"She terrifies you."
Hope said, looking at the cold, blank face he wore.
The fear was there in his eyes.
She was becoming a pretty good judge of what lay there.
"If you remembered her, she would terrify you too" he said into her open hand.
Hope lifted his face laying a gentle kiss on his soft lips.
"I have been wanting to do that for a while now."
she confessed.
Chapter 11
The fire had burned down to red coals by the time they returned to the camp.
Gaia was gone, leaving a small circle of ivy and forget-me-nots where she had been sitting.
Humphrey and Warren sat huddled together talking in low voices.
At the sound of footsteps, they were both on their feet with swords raised pointing out into the darkness.
"It is just us, War," Thane said  Hope wrapped her arms around her father, hugging him tightly.
"Dad, we need a plan."
"I know, sweetheart.
Humphrey and I were just trying to think what we might be able to do.
Zeus is powerful.
That's why he is King."
He released her, sitting back down rubbing his temples with the tips of his fingers.
The night winds played with her hair blowing it across her face.
Hope could smell flowers and green things.
She closed her eyes taking a deep calming breath.
Filling her lungs like she was taught as a young girl.
Mentally relaxing the muscles of her body.
"There has to be a way."
Hope said into the darkness.
"Medusa told us that Moros was behind the attacks from the satyr and minotaur.
What is the connection between Moros and Zeus?"
Humphrey pointed his cane at her, "I think you are on to something.
Moros was able to take a shadow form.
Possessing someone and controlling their actions like puppets."
"So Moros was able to possess Zeus," Hope said "How is that possible, he is Zeus for gods sake."
The irony of that was not lost on her.
If things had not been so serious she might have burst into giggles.
Thane paced around the fire like a caged panther.
"He is the king of the Gods, but he is not invincible.
Otherwise the Titans would have given up trying to conjure Earth centuries ago."
Warren groaned loudly, "Don't remind me of the Titans.
They're another pain in the ass for another day."
looking up at Thane, he added, "You and I need to remember our oath.
We are bound from harming Zeus in any way."
"Do either of them have some weakness?
Something we could exploit?"
Hope asked.
All three of the men looked at her.
A lump of fear started to form in her throat, making it hard to breath.
She suddenly knew how a deer felt caught by headlights on a dark night.
Chapter 12
"We need to speak with Zeus.
Find out if he really is possessed or else find out why he is trying to kill my daughter."
said Irene.
She stood on the other side of the dying fire next to Dora.
Warren walked over to embrace is wife.
"We are trying to find a way to do that without putting anyone at risk.
You know that Zeus can be volatile at the best of times, whether he is possessed by Moros or acting on his own won't be easy to learn."
Hope almost didn't hear Dora when she spoke, "Zeus was the old man at my party wasn't he?"
Humphrey dropped his head, sighing deeply.
"Yes."
he said.
"You called him 'sir'.
If he is the one trying to kill Hope, why didn't he do it at the party?"
"Because Zeus is still a good man."
The unfamiliar voice came out of the darkness.
The men had their weapons in hand in seconds.
It took a moment for Hope to remember her own sword hanging at her back.
Irene jumped in front of Warren and Thane, hands held up in the air, "Wait!"
After he had lowered his weapon, a woman stepped from the shadows.
Her long purple cloak had a large hood covering her face in shadow even as she stepped out of the dark.
Everyone but Dora and Hope dropped to one knee.
Thane reached up and pulled on her hand urging her to drop as well.
"Hope, meet Hera, Queen of the Gods."
Hera pulled the hood back from her face, waving off Thane.
"Let her be.
She owes me no alligience yet."
Hope recognized her from the party.
Hera had been wearing the purple dress and had made no effort to hide who she was with a fake name.
"My husband is still a good man.
He went to the party and gave the box to Dora hoping his guard would understand what was happening.
Moros can not keep control over him all of the time.
Zeus is too strong for that right now, but he is losing his hold more each day."
her voice broke at the end.
She had been holding on for so long.
It must have killed her inside a tiny bit each day watching her husband lose himself.
Hope reached out to her and Hera accepted the embrace.
"I am so sorry," Hope said.
"Please, sit down.
It must have been horrible for you to watch."
"Zeus is a stubborn man.
I believe that is the only reason Moros has not been able to overtake him."
she sat down on the ground her cloak floating to settle around her.
Feeling uncomfortable having her look up as she spoke, Hope sat down beside the Queen.
Everyone but Warren followed her lead.
He stayed standing, watching the dark.
"Does Moros know that you are aware of what is happening?
How did he get free?"
Humphrey asked leaning forward as he spoke the whites of his dark eyes showing by the dim light of the coals.
"I believe Moros is still trapped inside the Jar he was put in centuries ago.
After his last attempt to set the Titans free, Zeus moved the Jar to a place he felt was safest."
Hera said.
"His Throne."
Thane shook his head.
"I told him that was a bad idea.
We should have tossed it into Tarterus when we had the chance."
"Wait, what jar?
I don't understand?"
Hope asked looking back and forth between the faces around the fire.
Dora looked just as lost as Hope felt.
"I am going to take Dora for a walk."
Irene said rising to her feet staring hard at Humphrey.
"She needs the fresh air."
Humphrey rose to his feet with the aide of his cane, "Thank you, this has been hard on her.
I appreciate you watching out for her."
Irene's look softened, "You know I love you both," she said.
Taking Dora by the elbows, she helped her to her feet.
Hope watched them both fade into the night.
There was a look of profound sadness on every face there.
When Hope looked at Thane, he turned his face so she couldn't see his eyes.
Hera took both Hope's hands in hers drawing the younger womans attention back to her.
"Long ago you were someone else."
she started, "The Goddess Hope of the Pantheon.
Beautiful, powerful and a touch arrogant."
Humphrey made a sound deep in his throat.
"A touch?"
Hera glared at him silencing his commentary.
" A touch arrogant."
she repeated.
"Hope, I want to awaken your god-head.
Zeus needs you.
The Pantheon needs you.
If Moros succeeds in overtaking Zeus he will open the Gates of Tartarus allowing Chaos back into our world.
That must never happen."
the firm set of her jaw spoke volumes about how determined she was that Hope understand the importance of her words.
