Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

"Matter of fact, let's go up there and throw a monkey-wrench in his shit real fast."
"You crazy as hell, Rock.
Dusty gon' kill you if you stop him from bustin' a nut and he payin' for it."
"That dude ain't longwinded like that.
He probably finished already and only been up there five minutes," Rock said, laughing loudly.
They rode the elevator up to the third floor.
Dusty's grandmother had lived in the building since they were built over twenty years ago.
His mother died from a drug overdose when he was two years old, and his grandmother had been raising him ever since.
She was hardly ever home because she was a live-in home health aide for a wealthy family that lived on the upper westside of Manhattan, which gave Dusty free run of the house.
Rock stayed with Dusty because his mother was strung out on drugs.
She was a bonified dope fiend, and Rock never acknowledged her as his mother since he was a pre-teen and old enough to understand that she loved her high more than she loved him.
He called Dusty's grandmother "Momma".
She had taken him in because she was aware his mother didn't take care of him and she wanted to help out.
She loved both boys like they were her own, cared for them financially with what little she had, and gave them guidance whenever they needed or asked for it.
Rock opened the door and went straight to the back, while Lakim took a seat in the living room.
The house was well kept, considering two young boys stayed there.
Dusty came into the living room in his multi-colored boxers, then hugged Lakim and slapped him five.
"What up, La?
Yo, I thought you got hit up in that shootout!"
Dusty exclaimed.
"Nah, ain't shit happen to me," he replied with bravado.
"You know how these muhfuckas be stretching shit.
They was sayin' you got hit and was in the hospital.
They said Kendu caught one in the back and died on the way to the hospital.
Then they said Junior was shooting at the police and they cornered him and locked him up on attempted murder charges," Dusty reported.
"Wow!
Muhfuckas can tell some whoppers.
That shit sounds like it came straght out of a movie.
You know these dudes don't really be knowing shit.
Wasn't nobody even out there when that shit went down.
Kendu told me before the shit went down that everybody from the other side of the projects was down with it because they don't like Junior."
Lakim explained.
"Fuck dem crab-ass muhfuckas.
They mad 'cause Junior getting that paper in the hood, and they don't know how to embrace him.
So, they just go against him.
I heard them talkin' and shit, but I never fed into it because Junior mad cool with me.
He always look out for me when he sees me and he always hits me off wit' some ends when I ask him.
Them dudes just hatin' 'cause they don't know how to get no paper out here.
I did hear that Kendu flipped the script on you and shit.
What went down with that?"
Dusty asked.
"He came up to me and told me that Stump wanted to rob Junior and that he was down with that sucka shit.
Du was working for Junior, too, so I couldn't really figure out why he just flipped like that.
He told me to stay away from Junior because he didn't want me to get caught up in that shit, but I thought about it and told Junior what was going down before they aired him out.
Junior went and got right, then gave me some iron to hold shit down.
His cousin came through, and we set it off out there like Scarface.
I was bustin' at Stump and the whole shit."
Lakim added color to his story to make it more exciting.
"You was bustin' at Stump?"
Dusty asked, somewhat surprised.
"Hell yeah!
That muhfucka was trying to kill us.
I was trying to make him disappear for good!"
"I don't understand Kendu.
I mean, that was your man.
Why would he just flip like that?"
Dusty asked.
"Because he a closet smoker!"
Rock said, coming back into the living room.
"Joyce told me he was smokin' that shit, kid."
"Word?"
Dusty asked.
"That's my word.
She told me that shit a while ago.
She should know.
She smokes her damn self, and I guess a crackhead can recognize another crackhead by how they act," Rock assumed.
"Do you think he's really smokin'?"
Dusty asked Lakim.
"I don't know and I can't really say.
Just like Joyce can't really say unless she saw him smoking that shit.
You know what I mean?
All I know is that he was actin' mad funny about givin' me the work and money all of a sudden.
But you know something?
None of that shit really matters because he not gon' come 'round here no more no way.
Let me tell y'all what I came here for.
You still got a broad back there, Dusty?"
Lakim asked, peeking down the hallway.
"Yep, and I just got some brain for free," Rock said, laughing.
"You got head for free from her?
That bitch ain't gettin' nothin' else out of me with her raggedy ass."
Dusty was upset.
Lakim cut to the chase.
"Look, boys, I'm ready to put y'all on if y'all ready to start working."
"Hell yeah!"
they both said in unison.
"Let me tell you how it's going down.
Y'all gon' to work in shifts.
That way somebody will always be out there with some work twenty-four seven.
I want all the heads to know that our operation doesn't close.
Whatever time y'all choose you gon' have to stick to it.
No excuses.
My operation has to run like a real business.
Any competition is gonna be knocked out because the shit I got is top quality, and I'm putting more weight on the bottles, so the heads are going to be getting more bang for their buck.
So what y'all think?"
"I'm down.
I'm gonna stick to whatever schedule you give me, bruh," Dusty replied quickly.
"Ditto," Rock agreed.
"A'ight, cool.
I'm gon' set y'all up tomorrow.
I'm gonna take the morning, and y'all can split between the night," Lakim said.
"I'm gon' hit y'all with your packs now.
You take twenty off every hundred you sell.
Right now, it's gon' be a little slow, but once the heads know we back out here, it'll start clicking like I had it before."
Lakim offered them less than the twenty-five off every hundred Junior told him to give them.
His greed for money even had him taking a shift, when all Junior wanted was for him to distribute the work and pick up the money.
"Let me tell that bitch to get outta here," Dusty said to Lakim.
"You want to get some face, too, before I send this slut home?"
"Nah, man, I just want to take care of this shit, so I can go home and bag up the rest of the work I got," Lakim informed him.
"A'ight, man.
She got a fat ass, though."
Dusty tried to coerce Lakim.
"I ain't gonna lie, La.
For an older broad, she real nice.
You can't even tell she smoke that shit.
I woulda hit it, but I didn't have no rubber," Rock chimed in, trying to help convince Lakim.
The Puerto Rican woman was on the bed putting on her bra when Dusty entered the room.
"I thought you were finished.
I'm going back upstairs.
Who else is out there?"
she asked suspiciously.
"Only my man and Rock.
Why you suck his dick for free and you make me pay?"
Dusty asked her.
"He lie and tell me he gonna pay me, but he just leave the room after I finish and he no come back," Lizzette told Dusty.
"Well, you shouldn't have did shit without asking me first," Dusty said, upset Rock got served for free.
"I'm sorry.
I think since he your friend he no lie.
I don't like to do all the time.
I only do when I need money to get high.
You understand, yes?"
Lizzette said.
"Yeah and no.
You shouldn't be using that shit no way, as fine as you are.
If you wasn't on that shit, I would make you my girl and take care of you.
I'm about to get put on, so if you straighten yourself up, maybe that can happen.
But, that means you can't be sucking dick and giving up that good pussy for money or crack."
Lizzette's mind went into overdrive when Dusty said he was going to be working for his man.
Her habit was getting worse, and it was becoming difficult for her to hide the effects of the drug.
She was losing weight and her skin was turning pale.
Since Dusty lived in the same building, it would be convenient for her to cop the beige rocks and keep her habit a secret.
Yes, this would camouflage her addiction, and no one would really know what she was doing.
"I understand what you say, Dusty, but you no understand me.
I no do this all the time.
I just do when I need money.
I no want everybody to think that I will do all the time, you understand?"
Lizzette lied in her worst English.
"A'ight, fuck it," Dusty said, giving up.
"As long as I can still see you when I need to, I don't care.
I was just trying to look out for you.
I gotta take care of some business, so you have to leave.
