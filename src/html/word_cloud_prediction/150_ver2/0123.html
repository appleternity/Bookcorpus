Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

"That's right.
How many head you got for me?"
"Last we checked, a hundred thirty, but you should count them."
"Oh, we will."
Smith turned to the man next to him.
"Take the men and get started.
Signal when you're done so we can finish up and send these men on their way."
"Sure thing, boss."
"Deft, you go with them," Lon ordered, not trusting any of his other men to keep a close watch on Smith's people.
"You have any trouble getting them here?"
Smith watched as the men rode toward the front of the herd.
"None.
Didn't expect any.
'Cept it almost seemed too easy."
Smith cocked his head at Lon, his brows knitting together.
"No men were posted, keeping watch on the herd?"
Lon shook his head.
"One of the ranchers was getting married.
Didn't leave a single person with the herd while they celebrated.
Like I said, the job went almost too well.
A man could get drawn into believing it would always be this simple."
"Easier than robbing banks?"
Smith asked, his hand moving to the butt of his gun.
Lon's gaze narrowed on the man.
"What do you mean?"
he ground out, his face a mask as a hand inched toward the revolver on his hip.
"Don't get me wrong.
I don't care how a man makes his living, as long as he deals fairly with me."
He leaned over and spat on the ground.
"But don't get to thinking I don't check on who I'm doing business with.
No one's business stays private for long."
Lon's jaw tightened, but he held his tongue.
Reining his horse to get a better look at the herd, he saw Deft raise a hand at the same time as Smith's man.
"Appears we're good on a number."
"A hundred thirty head."
Smith reached into his pocket, pulling bills from a pouch.
Counting out the agreed upon amount so Lon could watch, he handed the money over.
"Pleasure doing business with you."
Taking the money, Lon slid it in a pocket.
"I'll contact you if another opportunity comes along."
"Make sure you do."
Lon rode straight toward Deft and his other men.
"Let's get out of here."
He had no reason to suspect Smith would try to come after them, but he didn't want to take the chance.
The sooner they put distance between them, the better he'd feel.
"You mean we ain't goin' into Sacramento to celebrate, boss?"
One of the older members of his gang rode up beside him, looking tired and haggard.
"Not this time.
We need to get away while we've got plenty of daylight ahead of us.
Besides, there's still a chance those ranchers will try to track us and I don't want to run into them."
Lon didn't explain his actions to too many.
Deft and this man were two of them.
"Guess I'll just save my celebrating for Crocker."
Reining around, he rejoined the rest of the men, passing along the news.
"It's a lot longer, but I'm thinking we ought to take the northeastern trail, Lon.
If the ranchers come after us, they'll probably be west of here."
He sent Deft a wry grin.
"You still got those badges we used after killing the sheriff and deputies from River City?"
"In my saddlebag."
"Pass them out to the same men who rode with us to Oregon.
We'll take the western trail to Crocker and send the others on the eastern trail.
No reason all of us should waste a couple extra days on the trail.
Tell them I'm being careful by splitting into two groups.
As always, we'll split the take when we get to the cabin."
Deft twisted in the saddle and reached into his saddlebag, pulling out a leather pouch.
"Here you are, Sheriff Walker."
Pinning it to his shirt, Lon laughed at how easy it was to be a lawman of convenience.

Chapter Twenty Colin, Blaine, Quinn, Brodie, Caleb, and a few cowhands rode out within an hour of learning about the missing cattle.
Following the tracks from the herd, they traveled several hours before Caleb noticed someone following them and moved off the trail.
Holding up, he waited until the rider got closer.
Muttering a curse, he moved back onto the trail.
"What the hell are you doing out here, Heather?"
The set of his jaw and hard voice made it clear how he felt about her disobeying her Uncle Ewan's orders not to ride out with the men.
Jutting her chin toward him, she started to ride past until he blocked her path.
Letting out a disgusted breath, her face turning the deep pink hue Caleb had come to expect when she was angry, Heather glared at him.
"I have every right to be here.
In fact, I have more right than you.
I'm a MacLaren and they're my cattle, too."
"Is that what this is about?
Your pride got hurt because I'm part of the search and you aren't?"
The thought she'd endangered herself by riding out alone angered him.
That she'd done it out of spite caused his blood to boil.
"Of course not," she spat out.
"And I don't have to explain myself to you."
"But you do have to explain yourself to us."
Heather winced at the hard tone of Quinn's voice.
So engrossed in their argument, neither she nor Caleb had seen Quinn and Colin ride up.
"You were told not to follow us for a good reason.
They needed you to help at the ranch.
What were you thinking?"
A muscle in Quinn's jaw quivered, betraying his deep frustration.
"Well?"
She glanced at Caleb and Colin, then moved her gaze to her brother, her eyes sparking in indignation.
"I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
All three of you know I can ride, shoot, and handle myself as well as any man.
I--" "Stop right now," Quinn roared.
"Your abilities had nothing to do with the decision our uncles made and you know it.
They needed you at the ranch.
What if the rustlers return, threaten the family?
Or worse, Coffman and his gang ride back to Conviction?"
He took a breath, trying to control his rage.
"Do you ever think of anyone but yourself, Heather?"
Quinn turned toward Colin.
"What do you want to do?"
Colin sent her a brutal stare, not shifting his gaze as he spoke "We can't send her back now.
Those clouds are threatening and it'll be dark soon."
"Fine.
She'll ride with Caleb."
"What?
No.
You're not going to saddle me with your family's problem.
Someone else can keep watch on her.
I want nothing to do with a woman with a lousy attitude and overblown belief in herself."
Caleb didn't wait for a response, reining his horse around to catch up with the rest of the men.
"I wouldn't ride anywhere near you, Caleb Stewart--even if you were the last man on earth," Heather shouted after him, her face turning the shade of a ripe tomato.
Quinn covered his mouth to control his laughter as Colin looked away so she wouldn't see his grin.
"You'll ride with Blaine, and don't even consider arguing with me," Colin added when she started to open her mouth.
"There are reasons we pair up, but I don't have time to explain it to you.
Do you understand me?"
As the oldest male MacLaren cousin, Colin's orders were followed without question when their uncles weren't around.
She nodded, irritation crossing her face at his condescending tone.
"We better join the others so we can cover as much ground as we can before the storm hits."
Quinn moved up beside Heather.
"Do what you're told without hesitation or I'll treat you as I would any other brat."
Colin hunkered down in the saddle, his duster doing little to protect him from the pounding storm.
It had started without warning minutes before, giving them scant time to pull on their trail coats and look for shelter.
"Up ahead."
Blaine pointed to a rock outcropping.
It would be a tight fit for everyone, but better than no shelter at all.
He looked at Heather, who hadn't left his side since joining them.
At least she had the good sense to bring her own duster.
They'd always gotten along well.
He respected how much she wanted to be her own person, although he didn't condone her habit of ignoring direct orders from the uncles or Colin.
She let her fierce independence and quick temper get the better of her most of the time.
If she didn't learn to control it, she'd eventually put herself, or others, in danger.
"You two go ahead and check it out.
I'll let the others know."
Colin reined Chieftain around, motioning the men toward the shelter.
"Quinn, make sure we aren't missing anyone, then have some of the men gather as much dry wood as they can."
Somehow, they found enough to keep a fire going.
They'd stripped the gear from their horses, placing the animals within sight outside the shelter.
Bigger than what they'd thought, it held all of them and their gear.
If the wind didn't shift too much, they'd stay protected until the storm passed.
Slouching near the back wall next to Blaine, Heather dug into her saddlebag, pulling out some jerky and offering him a piece.
"Thanks."
The others barely acknowledged her, feeling the tension between Colin, Quinn, and her.
No one ignored her more than Caleb, which bothered her more than a little.
Heather didn't understand what about him set her off, but she refused to let herself dwell on it.
"It's a shame these rustlers had to interrupt Colin and Sarah's honeymoon."
