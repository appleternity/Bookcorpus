Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves .

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

"Esteban and me too?"
questioned Ms. Potranco.
Ymelda nodded.
"Violeta and Arturo need to be alone at the moment."
Chapter 31
Violeta slumped down on the sofa in a stupor as she waited for Arturo to calm down.
Thankfully, he had stopped his frantic violence and was now frenziedly pacing the floor.
Finally, he took the seat next to Violeta.
They stared at one another for a few moments before either of them spoke.
"Arturo--" Violeta started to say.
"Give me some space," Arturo murmured.
"Can you leave for a while?"
She nodded with desolation.
How could she not give him what he wanted when she had been so unjust to him?
Besides, she also felt she needed some space away from him to put all the tragic business together without her enormous feelings of remorse swallowing her up.
Stepping out of the home, she knew where she needed to go.
She hadn't mastered very many ghost tricks since she had spent the time being furious with Arturo, so she still had to walk where she wanted to go instead of just appear there.
She hadn't been outside since the day she and Arturo had walked to the Zepeda house.
The colors and fragrances of summer were so vibrant.
When she had been alive her senses were nowhere near as sensitive.
It felt strange to see people she knew outside and not be able to stop and speak to them.
Of course, they couldn't see her.
Arriving at her destination, she floated through the walls of the house.
That was one ghostly trick she had mastered.
Rubi sat on a bed in her bedroom next to a crib.
Violeta went to the crib and found the beautiful baby boy fast asleep.
This little child had brought so many problems to her, but she in no way blamed him.
He was an innocent.
Rubi, on the other hand ...
Violeta turned to glare at her.
She appeared so blameless--unlike the guilty ogre Violeta saw her as-- while she read a romance book.
It burned Violeta to the core to think that Rubi was probably imagining herself with Arturo in the book!
Did she have any remorse for what had occurred?
Did she spend entire nights awake thinking about it?
Her lies and Senor Sandoval's silence had brought Violeta and Arturo to their deaths!
Of course, Rubi had never outright said that the baby had been Arturo's, but she had implied it.
The insinuation had been enough for the chain of events to explode!
Suddenly, Rubi's eyes grew misty as her eyes stayed on the pages of the book.
She set it down on her nightstand, putting a book marker in place.
Sighing heavily, she started to mutter something.
At first Violeta couldn't understand what she was saying, but then it became clear.
"Oh my Arturo, why did you have to die?"
Rubi mumbled over and over again.
Violeta's blood boiled further.
She wished she could be alive to slap the woman.
It was obvious that Rubi wasn't taking any responsibility.
Not any!
A harsh knock from the front door suddenly reverberated through the house.
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
Rubi eyed the crib and shot up from the bed.
Rushing to the door, she swung it wide open.
With curiosity, Violeta stood behind Rubi.
"What the hell are you doing?"
she told the man on the other side of the door.
"You'll wake the baby!"
"We've got to talk," snapped Senor Sandoval.
"What about?"
"We can't go on like this," he grumbled.
"The truth needs to come out!"
Rubi's eyes grew wide.
"Shhh!
Shut up!"
she demanded in a gruff whisper.
"Don't talk so loud.
Someone might hear you."
"The truth about my child--" "Get in my house before a nosy neighbor overhears," Rubi demanded, leading him inside while promptly closing the door after him.
"Anibal, have you gone insane?!"
Rubi blurted in a harsh whisper.
She didn't want to awaken the baby.
"I'm tired of everyone thinking I'm the baby's grandfather."
"It has to be like that," Rubi explained.
"There's no turning back now."
"I can't let the baby grow up thinking I'm his abuelo.
He has to know that I'm his father and not Arturo."
"Anibal, be reasonable," Rubi pleaded.
"We'd be crucified if people know the truth."
Senor Sandoval placed his agonized face in his hands.
"I don't care anymore."
""The truth can never come out."
"Actually, the truth already came out," he burst.
"What?!"
"It's out of the bag."
Rubi eyed him with horror.
"What do you mean?!"
Senor Sandoval sighed with misery.
"I couldn't take the guilt anymore so I told the Zepedas the truth."
"The Zepedas?"
"Yes, and--" "I'm sure they won't say anything about it," rushed Rubi, relieved.
"Those witches--" "They're not witches," Senor Sandoval shot back.
"They're shamans."
"Whatever.
Those two are discreet.
This whole village would explode if they told all the secrets they knew."
"They're not the only ones that know," Senor Sandoval informed.
"Others were there when I made my confession."
"What have you done to us, Anibal?!"
"Don't you want to be done with this farce?"
Rubi glared at him.
"I don't want to be crucified!"
"Maybe we deserve it."
"We made a mistake--we don't deserve to be crucified for it."
"It was a horrible mistake!"
he shot back.
"Yes, but what is done is done," Rubi declared.
"Who are we hurting?
Violeta and Arturo are dead."
She choked up when she said Arturo.
"Don't you feel guilty?"
"Look, Anibal, I loved your son with all of my heart.
I fought for him.
What's wrong with that?"
Senor Sandoval glared at her incredulously.
"My son is dead because of us."
"That's a lie!"
"Stop fooling yourself, Rubi."
"We don't know exactly what happened with the accident," Rubi declared wryly.
Senor Sandoval sighed deeply.
"Keep telling yourself you're not at fault--maybe someday you'll believe your own lie."
"Anibal--" "I'm glad I confessed."
"Who else was there when you made your confession?"
Rubi questioned, worried.
"Ms.
Potranco, the new renter of Arturo's home, her ex-husband and--" Rubi sighed with relief.
"That's great news!
Those people are just passing by and probably won't say anything."
"It's not them I'm worried about."
"What?"
"There were two more in the room."
Rubi's eyebrows knit together in concern.
"Who were they?"
"The ghosts of Arturo and Violeta."
Chapter 32
"What?!
Rubi burst incredulously.
"My son and the love of his life are back," Senor Sandoval simply said.
"Anibal, you've really gone completely insane.
TOTALLY BONKERS!"
Senor Sandoval shook his head.
"I'm not crazy.
Ask the Zepedas."
"I don't go anywhere near those witches!"
Rubi burst, still whispering harshly for the sake of her baby.
"You shouldn't either!"
"Those shamans spoke to Arturo for me."
"You're so gullible," she snapped.
"How much did they charge you?"
"Nothing."
Rubi sighed.
