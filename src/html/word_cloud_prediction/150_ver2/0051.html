Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI.

INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

For living entities, this may entail a proliferation of instances of the entity, or of desirable properties associated with the (single) entity. For non-living entities (economies, political locales, academic topics, etc.), this entails a proliferation of instances, or of activities that lead to instances, or any attribute that would prevent the entity from disappearing. This state is conceived of as temporary, or at least contingent on a number of changeable factors. Words expressing the opposite state, i.e., a lack of such positive activity, are also in this frame.  'In the 1920s the peach industry flourished in Upson County.'

Limping, I let him lead me to their cruiser.
I could've run if I'd wanted to, and I'm pretty sure I could've had a chance if it weren't for the dress and the heels.
On the way to the station, I vaguely remember blabbing on about teen crime and asking how many years do teen criminals spend in juvie.
But they didn't say much.
They didn't drive me to the station like I expected for taking off with the limo.
They brought me home.
Chapter 32
As I stood in front of my door, it wasn't pitch black anymore, but it wasn't exactly morning, just this strange kind of lightness.
Hemingway lay by my feet, faithful until the end, not heading inside or scratching at the door until I was ready to go inside.
The cops remained at the curbside, waiting for me to make my entrance and tell my parents I was off to the clink again.
At least they were giving me that.
I laid a hand flat against the wood.
On the other side, in my living room, was my family.
Dad, Mom, and Carter.
Uncle Rudie, Aunt Lulu, and probably Jules.
I cracked open the door and slipped inside.
My family sat with their backs to me, huddled on the couch.
Aunt Lulu rubbed Mom's back in a gesture of caring I'd never seen.
Jules was in a hushed conversation with my dad, and Carter strummed on his guitar.
Tears rushed to my eyes because I was home with my family, imperfect and everything.
"Will you stop that darn playing," Dad said.
Mom gasped and fanned herself.
Aunt Lulu bristled like a dog shaking off rain water.
Jules snorted.
I couldn't help but giggle while wiping away the tears.
Mom was the first one to see me.
Her mouth dropped open and she squeezed Dad's hand.
Then, one by one, they all realized I was there.
It only took about two seconds of shock and awkward silence for them to all move toward me at once.
"I'm sorry!"
I put up my hands like a shield.
"Please don't--" Any of my words were muffled by every person in my family trying to hug me at once.
It was like I had scored the final touchdown in the homecoming game, and they couldn't get enough of me.
During that hugfest, someone stepped on my toes, I swear my dress ripped, Uncle Rudie passed gas, and I heard several swears and accompanying gasps.
A strange feeling bubbled up inside.
That feeling swelled, choking me on the inside, and I couldn't hold back the rush of tears flooding my eyes.
My breaths came out like a shotgun and I started hiccupping.
"She's having a panic attack!"
Mom yelled, and everyone slowly backed off.
I stood there a bawling, hiccupping mess.
"I'm sorry for everything this past year.
Mom, I'm sorry I always get so dramatic on you, going on and on about stuff.
I'm sorry I always disappoint and fail because I know how much you care--I mean really care--and I can't always live up to that. But...
I'm me, and along with that come my nervous rambling and my impulsive decisions.
I'm sorry I'm not who you want me to be, and I'm sure it's too late..."
Dad spoke.
"I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say that you don't disappoint us, and we don't want you to be anyone but you."
The tears kept coming.
"But you sent me to the Program, and you made me go to that support group, which by the way didn't work well, and you kept wanting me to be someone I'm not.
I've tried, and I've had the worst year of my life.
And senior year is supposed to be your best year, the pinnacle of your life, when you should get the guy of your dreams and have the perfect prom date and wear pink dresses."
I crumpled over.
Mom led me over to the couch, her hand softly stroking mine.
"We did not send you to the Adventure Program because you disappointed us or because we didn't love you, but after last spring, when the cops and the school got involved, we had to show them we were taking proactive steps.
I thought you knew that."
"Stop!"
Jules cried.
Everyone looked up because Jules is always the model of social perfection.
Aunt Lulu twisted her hands and bit her lip.
Jules stood, trembling.
"I can't take it any longer.
You all have to know."
She rushed to me and dropped in front of me.
"I'm so sorry.
I never...never...never should have let it get this far.
I should've spoken up last summer, but I was too scared."
I wiped my tears.
"You don't have to do this."
But something inside me continued to swell as I saw the complete and utter brokenness on my cousin's face.
"Yes, I do."
She took my hands in hers.
"Cassidy, you are one of the bravest people I know.
You know what you want and you go after it.
You are you, and I love you for that.
I pander to the trends and the popular crowd where you're brave enough to swim against the tide."
"I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not."
"It is.
And it's time everyone knows it too."
She faced our family.
"It wasn't just Cassidy last spring who set up all the smoke machines at prom."
She grabbed me in a big hug and whispered, "I am so sorry."
Then she faced the family again.
"It was me, too."
Something stabbed at my insides.
This wasn't completely her fault.
I didn't stick up for myself.
I let someone else dictate my happiness.
"Jules?"
Aunt Lulu trilled.
"What are you trying to say?"
"Mom, I'm not perfect, and I can't be perfect.
It was my idea to prank the senior prom, and like a coward I let Cassidy take all the blame.
And I'm so sorry."
Everyone's face turned a tiny bit paler, but the truth bombs weren't done yet.
"No, it's not Jules's fault," I said.
Everyone looked at Jules and then at me.
"Well, is it or is it not true?"
Dad asked.
"Well, it's true but I don't blame Jules anymore.
I should've stuck up for myself.
I should've told everyone what happened instead of accepting all the blame.
That's my fault."
I finally realized that if I was stuck wearing a poofy yellow dress with a ginormous flower on the side, then it was my fault.
It wasn't Aunt Lulu's.
I could've insisted on trying that perfect pale pink shimmery spaghetti strap dress.
I see that now.
If I got stuck at the Program or in a support group with Zeke, even though his crooked teeth and his smile and the way he cares about me--or used to--grew on me every day, then it was my fault.
Mom clapped her hands, calling everyone to attention.
"There is a matter we need to discuss.
Everyone please take a seat."
We did.
I hung my head.
This had to do with the Porsche.
It had to.
Except I didn't think everyone--or the police--would be so forgiving about grand auto theft.
"We have to clear up a few misunderstandings.
First, Cassidy, dear.
Where have you been all night?"
"Well, after prom, I went to Aunt Lulu's house and waited in the backyard in the swing...and then I fell asleep.
Hemingway found me."
At the sound of his name he trotted over and lay at my feet.
"You didn't think to call?
We've been worried sick all night after Jules told us about your little melt down at prom.
You're not in trouble, but in the future, you need to let us know where you are.
Understood?"
"Understood."
Mom straightened her back and a no-nonsense attitude came over her.
Inside, I was secretly cheering her on even if she was about to send me to the Adventure Program again.
"And now, what is this nonsense about senior year being the pinnacle of your life and the year you find the perfect guy and have the perfect prom?"
"Well..."
I looked to Carter and Jules for support, but they just shrugged.
"After that it's all downhill, ya know?"
Aunt Lulu ruffled her body like she was a giant flamingo about to take flight.
Then she snorted in a full-out piggy noise, so unlike Aunt Lulu that I almost giggled.
"Cassidy, you've got to understand--" "I'll take care of this, Lucille, if you don't mind."
Mom looked back at me.
Aunt Lulu sat back down a bit miffed, but listening.
"High school is one of the hardest times of your life as you struggle with who you are and who you want to be.
Never mind the added pressure of popularity, grades, and college to think about."
Then she looked and incorporated Carter and Jules.
"Your whole life is in front of you, and what kind of date you get for prom doesn't dictate how the rest of your life will go.
Got it?"
We nodded.
I think finally, we'd run out of words and apologies and truth telling.
"I've been working on this new song."
Carter reached for his guitar.
"No!"
we all said.
Dad stood.
"I think it's time for tea and coffee and maybe some toast with jam and butter."
