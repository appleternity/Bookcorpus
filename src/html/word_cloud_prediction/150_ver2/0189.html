This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Identity persists across time and remains constant for an Instance despite arbitrary changes in other attributes of the Instance.  Establishing Identity answers the question "which".  \'I still have questions about her identity .\' \'Which dinner did you choose ?\'  Identity is not the same as appearance or name (if the Instance even has such), although these attributes of the Instance may be useful in establishing Identity.  Identity can be established knowing the totality of the history of an Instance; however, this is impractical and usually proxies like name and appearance are used.  For the Identity of humans, history sufficient to establish Identity can usually be satisfactorily established by documents associated with the person, often with information like appearance and name, though use of such documents contributes to the problem of multiple identities, only one of which is considered legitimate or "true" in a given context.  Just as we would consider gun in "fake gun" to contain a reference to the normal concept of Weapon, we consider identity in "multiple identities" to belong to this frame, even if only one of the identities is legitimate.  Multiple identities can also exist when each is primarily associated with a fragment or aspect of the history and attributes of an entity, and the "true" identity might be very much debatable; in most such cases, there are different names associated with the different identities, as in the case of stage names or Ellis-Island names, but sometimes, the different "identities" go under the same name (e.g., some members of secret societies). While these may be considered different identities, they refer to the same person. \'\' This frame is intended to cover cases where an entity is mentioned, but the category it fits is what is actually meant:  \'We need to determine the identity of the metal used in the picture frame .\'  In this case, it is not individual identity of the physical hunk of metal that is intended to be in question, but rather the category that the hunk of metal fits into; i.e., the specific element or elemental composition of the metal is what is in question.  Such sentences should be understood as determining which Instance of the supercategory is intended.  \'\' This frame is not intended to cover related, and often more common, uses of the word "identity" such as "sexual identity", "national identity", or "brand identity", which do not refer to a unique identity of an Instance, or even the identity of a supercategory of the Instance, but rather refer to the specific properties of an Instance that are considered very important for how the Instance operates in aggregate.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

But as you say, there are so many murders."
"I think you'll recognize Ivan's work, Jim."
After hanging up, Kirby went for a walk, wandering far from her apartment and finally into Central Park.
There were joggers, bicyclers, people walking dogs and tossing Frisbees.
They seemed happy with their lives and it came to her that she too could be happy again.
Simply forget Flight 777, forget the other two survivors, go back to Stan and tell him the whole thing was history.
She could still take off a couple of weeks.
Go to Europe, or the islands, any islands.
The thought of freedom made her feel better.
She hurried back to her apartment and punched in the number for Arthur Martin once more and once more heard the voice of his secretary.
"This is Kirby Lotto.
I called before, earlier today."
"You upset Mr. Martin," an icy voice replied.
"He doesn't want to talk to you."
"That's fine," Kirby shot back.
"In fact I don't want to talk to him, but I feel it's my duty to make the effort."
"Well, I'm not putting you through this time," the secretary said stubbornly.
"I'm glad of that.
I merely want to go on record that I tried to give him certain information about his grandson."
Then she repeated her name and told the secretary her phone number.
"If this Martin has a change of heart, I will talk to him.
But I'm not eager for the opportunity."
Then with some satisfaction, she slammed down the receiver.
But the matter was too grim for gloating.
It came to her that the gate attendant in St. Louis could verify her story.
He might be reluctant to because he had broken a strict rule, but serious issues were at stake.
Kirby talked to fully half a dozen airline employees before she learned the man's identity from another attendant.
"Jim was upset something awful by that crash.
You'd have thought it was his fault," the woman said.
"Is he on duty today?"
"No.
He's gone.
I mean, on leave.
You see the media got after him.
They wanted a firsthand account from the last person to see the passengers and crew on that doomed airplane.
That's what they called it a 'doomed airplane.'
Heavy stuff.
Anyway, they gave him fits and he asked for time off and got it.
Jim's a real gentleman."
"Is he at home?
Does he have a family?"
"Lives with his mother, just her and a couple of dogs.
They got sort of a little farm out towards St. Charles.
Not a real farm, but four or five acres.
He brings me produce sometimes, you know, in season."
"Yes, I like produce.
Fresh stuff."
"That's it," the woman said.
"Do you have her name?"
"Sure.
I've been out there more than once.
I've got the phone number.
His mother's name is Betty Lou Henderson.
She's a fine woman.
Loves dogs."
The Henderson phone rang almost a dozen times and Kirby was about to hang up when a breathless woman answered.
"I was out back.
Who's this?"
Kirby identified herself and explained her business.
"Jim's gone," Mrs. Henderson said.
"The press people were after him like a pack of wildcats.
There was two out here this morning, before I had breakfast.
You should've seen them run back to their van when I set the dogs on them.
You know them dogs are just big playful kids, but strangers don't know that.
They're a blessing."
"I can imagine.
Just where did Jim go?"
"Off to visit his father.
He's been promisin' to do that for five years.
This seemed the perfect time.
You know he gets to fly cut rate.
Almost anywhere in the world.
Can you imagine?"
"It must be wonderful.
Where is his father?"
"Mr. Henderson.
We're still married, you know.
Divorce wasn't part of our marriage contract.
We never were the flighty kind."
"But he's not in the home," Kirby said.
"Not your home."
"Oh, Lord no.
He's in Malaysia.
He's a lumberman.
Forester really.
Has a degree and all.
Hardwood."
"He works for a company?"
"Oh, yes.
Couldn't work alone over there.
Although they say those Malays are good people.
Honest people and hard workers.
Of course you have to treat them right.
Mr.
Henderson has always known how to deal with people.
He's been over there for fifteen years now."
"Do you have a phone number in Malaysia, Mrs. Henderson?"
"Please, just call me Betty Lou.
Everyone else does."
"Is there a phone, Betty Lou?"
"There's an office in Kuala Lumpur.
That's the capitol, you know.
The two or three times I've tried to call, I've never been able to get through to Mr. Henderson.
He's always someplace between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.
You can leave a message, but sometimes it's a week, two weeks before it's delivered.
They're in the bush.
That's what they call it, back in the bush."
"Well, how would Jim find him?"
"He called and left a message.
Then he flew to Singapore.
There's a train that runs up to Kuala Lumpur, stations all the way.
He'll call again from Singapore, and then Mr. Henderson will meet him somewhere on that train line.
That's been the plan for years, but this is the first time Jim's made it.
You know there's not much to do over there."
"But the climate's good," Kirby said, feeling she had been aced again by some unseen hand.
"You know that's a fact, Miss...
What did you say your name was?"
"Kirby.
Kirby Lotto."
After the call to Betty Lou, she toyed with the idea of mixing herself a drink.
Instead she changed clothes and went out to a movie.
After that she had dinner alone.
During the cab ride back to her apartment she wondered how to approach Stan Mayfield.
Should she recant?
Say she was not on the flight?
No.
It would be best simply to tell him she was willing to forget the entire episode, to speak of it no more.
But there was the matter of the letters.
They would probably be ignored.
Cranks were a dime a dozen.
Kirby took a long, hot shower before climbing into cotton pajamas and piling into bed.
She slept well during the early hours of the night, but came awake, suddenly frightened, just before dawn.
For a long while she stared at the darkened ceiling, reliving the crash of Flight 777.
She realized there would be nightmares, but hopefully, gradually, they would fade.
Sleep came again just as dawn came to Manhattan Island.
The phone jarred her awake at seven.
Surprisingly, a man's voice she had heard before announced that it was Arthur Martin.
"I'm calling from home, Miss Lotto.
I've talked to my wife about this and we've had a bad night.
I'd like to hear your story."
"It's a fine time to be calling.
I'm still in bed."
"I've agreed to talk to you, Miss Lotto.
That's quite a concession."
"It's no concession, Mr. Martin.
I've got actual information about your grandson.
I think he's still alive.
Now I've gone out of my way to bring you that information and you treat me like a piece of shit.
I'm sick to death of it."
"Maybe I have been rude," he conceded.
