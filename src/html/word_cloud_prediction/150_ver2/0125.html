This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

I walked up the steps, house key in hand.
We entered my apartment.
I hadn't been home since earlier this morning after having sex with Agent Keaton.
The place looked lonely and dark.
I reached for the light switch.
Nothing.
"That's odd.
I could've sworn I paid the light bill last week,"   "He was here alright that's the only logical explanation there is.
He was probably hoping you'd be coming home late by yourself.
Completely vulnerable."
I listened as Graham spoke of the terrible misfortune I was sure to have stepped into if not for that disturbing email.
I hugged myself and thanked God for protecting me.
Suddenly, there was a rustle.
Someone was still inside.
Graham heard it too and raised his Glock.
I had mines drawn as well.
My heart was pounding against my chest as I walked further inside my apartment.
If the killer was still here, he had a small advantage over us; he could be hiding in a small alcove somewhere.
I forced myself to think of happier thoughts but it wasn't working that well.
Urgent footsteps rushed past us.
We let off a few rounds at the attended target but we didn't have luck on our side in the dark.
The front door flew open and a tall figure moved swiftly out into the night.
Graham and I rushed over to try to get a shot off while the intruder ran through Christopher Park.
However, by the time we got into position he'd vanished almost into thin air.
Like a phantom
CHAPTER 52
He'd gotten away.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE audacity this killer had.
Graham and I had been in the same room as the Coed Killer!
I had dispatcher put out a BOLO on him.
I gave her a very vague description of him: tall, fair skinned a noticeable limp.
I hadn't been able to see more of him because of the darkness of my apartment.
Graham had demanded that Commissioner Wilson place a security detail around my place.
It didn't go over well with the Commissioner but he got Wilson to grant to security detail.
"You mean to tell me you woke me up in the middle of the night for a security detail?"
I overheard Commissioner Wilson yelling at Graham.
The Commissioner was pissed.
"Sir, with all due respect, but I fear that this killer isn't going to stop coming after Sergeant Luckett until he kills her.
I'm just asking that you put two patrolmen stationary for her sake."
I heard Graham respond.
I was watching his facial expression.
I could tell that Commissioner Wilson was succumbing to the fact that my life was in danger.
Finally, I seen Graham close his phone and sigh heavily.
He walked over to me.
"Well?"
I prompted.
I was eager to hear what Commissioner Wilson had to say.
"He doesn't like the whole thing one bit, says we don't have the budget to spare two officers.
But he okayed it anyway.
He's making some calls now and expects someone to be outside your house in about fifteen minutes."
Graham looked completely defeated.
I could see this killer was taking a toll on him too.
"You're not staying here until they arrive, are you?"
I wanted to know.
After the unexpected events of the night before with Agent Keaton, I didn't trust myself alone with another law enforcement officer.
"Yes," he said.
"I'm staying here until one of them shows up,"  "Really, David you don't have to I'll be fine.
Trust me."
"I have no problem staying Sagittarius and besides Carla hates it when I come home late, it wakes her up."
"How do you know she isn't already awake right now?
Maybe waiting for some sex?
Who knows," I was trying to get him to go home, even to his car.
Anywhere except for my place.
I understood how much Graham loved Carla.
I didn't want to jeopardize their relationship over unwanted sparks flying between us.
"I tell you what; I'll stay in a squad car across the street.
How's that?"
he suggested.
"Perfect,"  Soon after I'd gotten rid of Graham's company I went back inside and tried to concentrate on why I was being targeted by the Coed Killer.
Who was he really?
Did I know him?
Did I do something to piss him off?
Those questions kept circulating inside my head until I finally drifted off into a deep sleep.
The following morning I'd woken up drenched completely in sweat.
Did I have yet another dream about the Coed Killer?
I didn't know for sure but I knew I wasn't drenched in sweat because I was hot; it was forty something degrees outside.
I padded to the bathroom for a quick shower before work.
I left Graham a voice mail to let him know that I wasn't going to be in until lunchtime.
After my shower, I dressed moderately, grabbed my keys and headed downtown to visit my former confidante, Michelle Lewis.
I wanted to see if she'd reconsider and tell me where I could find her brother.
Traffic was backed up at nine that morning, early commuters trying to beat the morning rush hour.
The traffic was inching forward one inch at a time.
However, after ten minutes I was able to take a detour and arrived at the Metro Correctional Facility about a quarter after.
There was a different Officer standing sentry.
Her name was Officer Kevlar according to her lapels.
She was looking rather chirpy might I add to be spending her time guarding the city's jail.
"Good morning Officer," I said as she waved me through the metal detector.
"I'm here to visit Michelle Lewis," She gave me a distraught look like I'd spit in her face.
"That one," she said, shaking her head.
"She's in the 'hole'.
Bitch tried to attack one of the guards the other night.
Nearly cut his eye out with some makeshift shiv."
"Really?
So I take it she can't have visitation albeit she's under investigation?"
"Negative.
But if you'd like you can visit someone else."
She was grinning hard.
CHAPTER 53
"NO THANKS," I TURNED and walked away.
I had to get in there and speak with her.
I needed to see if she'll tell me where her brother is hiding out.
I pulled out my phone to check and see if there were any messages for me.
Nothing.
I punched the "Three" button on my speed dial and waited for Agent Keaton to answer.
After he didn't answer the first time, I called again.
"You must have nothing better to do than to blow my phone up, Sergeant.
What's up?
I'm a little on the busy side right now."
Keaton spoke firmly into the receiver.
I flashed on how firmly he had spoken to me the night we'd made love.
He definitely enjoyed being in control.
"I want to know why Michelle can't have visitation while in the segregation.
She could tell us where her brother's hiding."
"Sagittarius, if she was going to be forthwith about her brother's whereabouts don't you think she would've the last time you talked with her?"
"Okay but the point of the matter is this; we need to catch this killer before he continues to rack up the body count all over New York.
It's a strong possibility that Chester Lewis is our guy.
Even you agreed about that."
"I also agreed that this is a federal investigation and that your role in the matter is nothing more than a consultant.
In addition, the only reason for that is that you have a knack for details.
Look I'm not trying to give you the boot but it's best if you're on the sideline.
The killer is already targeting you don't you get it?"
I hung up.
I didn't have time to listen to him rant about a bunch of bullshit.
Men and their egos.
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have a case to begin with.
The Feds could be assholes about this kind of thing it's ridiculous.
I walked quickly to my Jeep a little paranoid that I had someone call out my name before committing suicide.
I climbed in behind the wheel and headed to the station.
The whole way there, I kept thinking of a way to bypass the jailhouse visitation rules.
I was closing my car's door when my cell phone rang.
I answered more annoyed than ever.
"Look asshole if you're going to sideline--"  "Sagittarius Joanne Luckett.
That is no way to answer your phone young lady.
That filthy mouth deserves a good cleansing."
There wasn't anyone within a 100-mile radius that knew my full name.
I didn't expect to be hearing from my Aunt Josephine.
She lived close by, in Chelsea.
But we hadn't spoken since I decided to become a homicide cop instead of some girly nurse for Brooklyn Memorial Hospital.
She strongly believed that being a cop was a man's job.
I disagreed completely.
Now that my sister had been murdered, she wanted to talk.
Great timing, Aunt Josephine.
"Aunt Josephine?"
"Who else were you expecting?
The Tooth Fairy?"
Her sarcasm was laced by her thick Northern accent.
"Always the sarcastic one, Aunt Jo?"
"And you're always the potty mouth," "So what blessings are you bring me on this cold October morning?"
I gave her a little bit of my sarcasm I'd picked up from her as a child.
"Unless you're really getting married like the Catholic girl that you are, none.
