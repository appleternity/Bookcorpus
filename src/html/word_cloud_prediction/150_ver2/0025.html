In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

But I had to get back to my carpetbag!
I wasn't worried about my animals; the soldiers had already passed them.
But if they found the carpetbag I was done for.
My hands caught spider webs as I dug my way through the trees.
The leaves crackled loudly.
Nervous, I stopped.
I couldn't make a scene.
I didn't want them to know I was coming back, that I had left something.
They would most certainly hold me captive and find the carpetbag.
They would find the spotters, and my sword and scabbard that were packed into the bag.
Then they would most certainly know who I was.
A bee buzzed past my ear.
It left a trail of thoughts for my mind to catch, thoughts of hurrying so I could get the bag and be on my way to the waters.
Thinking about my wound caused it to start pounding.
I brushed my hand over it to feel how it fared, clenching my teeth in anguish.
It was doing no better.
Finally I spotted the place where I had left my bag.
It was about sixty feet from where I stood.
The soldiers were even closer.
One soldier started nearing the carpetbag's hiding spot!
"Hey, sir, look!"
My stomach tossed itself over, leaving my face green as he pulled it out of the leaves.
Waves of doom washed over me.
"Must be the girl's.
Stick it on the back of my horse," the commander replied.
"Can't I see what's inside it?"
he begged.
I shook my head back and forth, violently, until it ached with all the powers of darkness.
"No!
We don't have time, you dimwit.
Now do as I say!"
He kicked at his horse impatiently.
So they had the bag, but had not yet looked inside.
Fate was working neither my way nor their way.
I held my breath and followed the pack which was headed in the opposite direction of the waters, of course.
Fast, too.
It did not take long for my feet to start aching.
Huffing and puffing, I jogged after them in the woods as quietly as I could.
The soles on my boots started flapping, and rubbish started filling my shoes.
I could feel blisters forming, but I could not stop to mourn.
I had to get my carpetbag.
If they found out it was me, it could endanger all of Tentaleigh!
I could be held for ransom or something worse.
But my head was too drained to think of anything worse.
I just knew that I had to get it back.
A root stuck itself out rudely right in front of me, knocking me to the ground.
My ankle twisted all the way around, but I didn't hear it snap.
But it hurt like it had.
For a second I thought I saw my life flashing before my eyes, but then I realized it was just helpless tears streaming down liberally.
And it was just a sprained ankle.
Thoughts of dread and anguish tried to push away the pain with little success.
I looked at my ankle, trapped under the root, and twisted all the way around.
It was swelling noticeably, and the circulation was sure to be cut off if I didn't get it out from under the root.
If I tugged, I would scream from torment.
But if I didn't, I wasn't sure what would happen.
I was on my own.
I had to make my own life or limb-saving decisions.
My ankle was already the size of an orange.
I winced every time I looked at it.
But nonetheless, I had to look at it as I pulled the root from the ground to free my ankle.
Remembering that I was on a mission, I looked up to see how far the soldiers had gotten.
They were grapes in the distance.
Why was I thinking about food?
"No!
We are late already."
I heard them shouting in the distance.
"We have a whole day to make up.
We won't stop.
Not tonight!"
My heart fell to my feet.
I would have to run to catch up!
My ankle throbbed as I forced it to move.
I tried walking on one foot, but I nearly fell over.
I grabbed a vine to keep my balance, and regrettably it was full of thorns.
My hand slid down, still with a firm grip on it.
The pain tingled in my hand.
I stumbled as fast as I could, rushing one leg and letting the other go as sluggish as it pleased.
My good leg caught under a vine that rested snugly in the ground and tripped.
Not wanting to twist the other ankle, I slammed my bad leg down to keep myself from falling.
A surge of unbearable pain shot up my leg and knocked me to the ground.
I put my fingers in my mouth and bit as hard as I could.
My head started throbbing, and my stomach whipped around in circles inside my body.
Distant voices started up, but I could barely make them out.
Everything started fading.
"Fine! ?double time in the morning.
Tomorrow then? fast? now go?"
And I drifted into an agonizing swoon.
Chapter 10
When I woke up, I had forgotten all about everything.
Until I moved.
"Ouch!"
I shrieked.
I shot up and looked around.
Wiping sweaty hair from my face, I looked at my ankle.
It hadn't gotten any bigger, but it hadn't gotten any smaller.
I gently rubbed my finger over the black and blueness.
Then I remembered the carpet bag, and the soldiers!
They were bound to be more than miles away.
I forced myself to stand up.
Another blast of pain ran up my leg.
I grabbed the nearest tree branch and pulled myself up.
Then, with a surprised gasp of relief I dropped myself again.
The soldiers were camped right in front of me!
Silently I plummeted to the ground and started to arrange a strategy.
It was still dark, and they were snoring loudly.
If I could crawl over the sleeping men, I could get to the horse on which my carpetbag had been kidnapped from its resting place in the leaves.
I stood up again and tried to steady my shaking legs.
The quivering wasn't from nervousness, it was from pain.
I just bit my lip and tried to ignore it.
On one foot I climbed from my hiding spot.
The leaves crackled.
I hushed them and tried to be gentler.
Now out of the woods, I hunched over a bit.
They were snoring very loudly.
I sucked in my breath and stepped over a sleeping soldier.
He didn't move, but I found it was easier to keep my balance if I was upright.
Anyway, they were all asleep.
They weren't going to see me.
One man after another I crept over.
I had one leg over a man, striding over him.
He let out a few words, and I was ready to run.
But he was just talking in his sleep.
I was about to lift my leg to crawl over him the rest of the way, when he shot a hand up in the air.
His fingers clamped and unclamped, searching for something.
I scooted from his suspended hand and lifted my leg.
Then he moved his arm, and grabbed my ankle.
My marred ankle.
He squeezed my ankle, which was swollen and full of fluid.
My eye balls threatened to pop from their sockets.
I held my throat and screamed with my mouth closed, resolving that out of all the pain I had endured so far this was the worst.
My pounding head was screaming, "Let it go you daft combatant!!"
I started getting woozy and swayed.
Finally he let go, and I caught myself on the ground with one hand and one leg.
Bit by bit I eased myself up to an upright position.
Inches away from the horse that had my bag in cache, I bounced on one foot.
I almost fell over, catching myself on the horse.
"It's okay girl," I whispered.
I was worried about the horse waking someone up.
But it was I who ended up doing the waking.
"Hey!"
A sleepy groan startled me, thrusting a nervous feeling into my stomach.
I spun around, and saw the commander pulling on his pants and pointing at me.
"You?"
My eyes darted anxiously from the commander to the horse.
Commander to horse.
The horse.
With all the strength I had in my good foot I pulled myself onto the horse.
"Yah!"
I kicked the horse, with both feet.
And oh, did it hurt.
