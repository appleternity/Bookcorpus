The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.         The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.       The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.       Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.       Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance to other potential Audience members.

'' In the frequent case where the Booker is the same as the Client, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Client on the second.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

"You could be wrong," Toshiro pointed out wanting to get the last word in.
Those light brown eyes stared at him with challenge.
Jason wanted to reach out and smooth out the small frown lines creasing Toshiro's forehead.
Instead of keeping up their silly argument, he chose another tactic.
"Do you always get this cranky when you're out fishing?"
Toshiro leaned back in his seat, and crossed his arms against his chest.
"I don't fish."
Well, that wasn't a yes or no.
Did that mean that Toshiro had fished before?
Toshiro's past intrigued him.
Jason wanted to know what had put that troubled look in Toshiro's eyes.
"What do you do for fun?"
"For fun?"
Toshiro repeated as though it was a trick question.
"I like fishing for fun.
I have a loft over the shop in town.
Some days I close the shop early, so that I can watch football on the flat screen in my living room or Sean and I go play pool at the local pub."
Jason smiled at Toshiro.
"What do you like doing?"
Toshiro's gaze slid away from him and instead roamed their surroundings.
They'd stopped the boat in the middle of the lake.
Jason liked the endless feeling he got sitting in this particular spot.
Surrounded by trees, the water an endless sheet on all sides, it humbled a man to be so small in the vast beautiful setting.
Watching Toshiro take in the scene quickly became his most favorite thing to do just then.
Toshiro dropped his gaze to his lap and stared at a spot on his black jeans.
When he spoke, painful nostalgia tinged his tone.
"I--uh--I used to have a bicycle when I was around eight.
I would ride it to all kinds of places.
I loved the feel of the wind on my face."
Toshiro smiled ruefully.
"I haven't ridden a bike since then."
"Why?"
Toshiro shrugged and shook his head.
"Lots of things changed, no time to run around acting like a carefree child."
Jason put his beer in the cooler on the floor of the boat and sat up in his seat.
"You can always ride again.
I'm sure there are a couple of bikes in the garage."
Toshiro lifted his head to meet his gaze.
"Are you always this positive?"
"No."  Jason took Toshiro's right hand in his.
"I'm only this way around you."
"You don't say?"
"Can't help it, you have this tragic air about you.
You make me want to dispel it."
"Jason...."
Jason moved to the edge of his seat, so that he could close the distance between him and Toshiro.
Their gazes held, Toshiro's full of uncertainty.
Jason grabbed on to Toshiro's open jacket and pulled him closer.
He bent his head to take Toshiro's lips in a warm soft kiss.
He lingered when Toshiro leaned into him.
Tasting Toshiro's full bottom lip, his tongue tracing, teasing, he kissed Toshiro again, this time Toshiro responded, kissing him back.
Jason pulled back slightly, and met dazed light brown eyes.
Relief flooded him when Toshiro didn't protest, or push him away.
Instead, that honeyed gaze he was starting to love fell on his lips.
He read longing on Toshiro's face, that knowledge heated his blood.
It was good to know he wasn't the only one caught in this attraction.
"I've wanted to kiss you since that day in the hospital when you told me you weren't good for me."
Cupping Toshiro's face between his palms, he kissed him again.
"I wanted to kiss you and tell you I didn't care."
Toshiro closed his eyes.
"You should care, Jason."
"Why?"
"Because."
Toshiro opened his eyes and tried to move away.
Jason wouldn't allow it, so he dropped his gaze.
"I wasn't kidding when I told you I wasn't good for you."
Jason kissed him again: a frenzied, needy kiss that had them both breathing hard.
When he broke off, he pulled Toshiro into his arms.
Putting them both in an awkward position on the boat, but he didn't care.
"Let's make a deal," he said against Toshiro's ear.
He closed his eyes when Toshiro's arms slowly moved around him and tightened.
"What kind of deal?"
Toshiro asked, his voice muffled by Jason's windbreaker.
"For as long as you're here with me, you'll stop putting yourself down."
Jason rubbed Toshiro's back over his leather jacket.
"Whether you're good, or bad, it doesn't matter to me."
"What happens when I leave?"
Jason sighed.
"Don't think about leaving either."
Toshiro chuckled.
"Are we planning an imaginary world here?"
"Maybe," Jason said wishfully.
"I want to hold you like this for as long as I can.
So, just say yes to what I say and go along with it.
Deal?"
*** Eyes closed, his face buried in the curve of Jason's neck, Toshiro took in a deep breath, filling his lungs with Jason's enticing scent.
His heart squeezed tight, so tight, it was painful.
"Toshi?"
Jason prompted in his ear.
Toshiro opened his eyes and made a promise he was sure he shouldn't keep.
"Deal," he said.
Jason held him tighter.
He melted against Jason's warmth letting it soothe his tattered soul.
He was disappointed when Jason let him go.
Toshiro didn't understand how it was possible for a man to be so warm, so giving and comforting.
Their conversation lightened, Jason told him stories of growing up in Penn Yan.
His face lighting up as he talked about his mother who now lived with her new husband.
"I thought I'd hate seeing her get married, but watching her with him makes me smile," Jason said.
"They're so in love.
I get jealous that she found someone to be with her as she ages."
Toshiro couldn't help but wonder about his own mother.
Did she think about him?
He'd heard rumors that she was tough and ruthless in business.
Did she love his father?
"What about you, Toshi?"
Jason asked him.
"What were your parents like?
Did you get to meet them before they died?"
Toshiro wiped a hand down his face.
"I--uh--I don't like talking about it."
"It's good to talk about your parents, Toshi," Jason insisted.
"You'll keep their memory alive that way."
"I was too young to remember much," Toshiro said unable to keep out the bitterness.
"I don't have a single memory.
Can we please change this subject?"
"Toshiro," Jason started.
Toshiro grabbed his fishing rod and pulled it out of the water.
"Can we go back now?
I'm getting cold out here."
Toshiro ignored Jason's concerned gaze, trying to push back the anger that swelled each time he thought about his family.
He didn't want to talk or think about his parents.
He wasn't worthy of being a Natake.
That family was full of upstanding members of society, he'd seen the Natakes run projects to help the poor, and abused.
He, on the other hand, had spent most of his life reducing good people to the state of abused, or worse.
How could his father ever look at him and be proud?
How could Jason if he were to find out the truth about him?
"I've said something to upset you," Jason said touching his left arm.
"I'm sorry."
"Don't apologize," Toshiro said.
"I'm-- He broke off and met Jason's concerned gaze.
"I'm not used to sharing.
You have to give me time."
Jason smiled, the sight of it disarming him.
"I don't mind, Toshi.
Since we didn't catch any fish, should we get back to the dock and find out what we'll have for dinner?"
"That sounds good," he agreed as Jason got his fishing rod back into the boat.
"Maybe we should bring fishing nets next time," Jason teased as he started the motor.
Toshiro shuddered.
"No way, who would prepare and cook all that fish?"
"You," Jason said with a grin.
"Hells no," Toshi laughed.
"I'd definitely leave it to you, mister."
*** That evening, Toshiro was in the common bathroom after a shower, his concentration centered on the healing wound on his right arm when Jason knocked on the door.
"Are you decent?"
"Yeah," Toshiro said as he taped a bandage over the healing bullet wound on his arm.
He was looking forward to removing Agent Baron's stitches.
"How did you get that?"
Jason asked in shock behind him.
Toshiro met Jason's gaze through the mirror.
"It's just a scratch."
