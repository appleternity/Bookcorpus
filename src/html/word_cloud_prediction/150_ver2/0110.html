LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'  'My life instantly changed from an empty life, to a life full of joy and purpose.'  'As you can see, the word WALK changed from red to green rather than have a separate lens for each colour.'  'My feet turned to stone.'  'The promise will turn to ashes if progress is not made.'  'The price  changed from $1.26 to $1.27 per pint. DNI'  'At least one relative instruction has changed in size from short to long.'  In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

"We might just..."
"WHAT?!?"
screams a male voice.
Holy crap, Zoe thought, I think it just hit the fan.
She hears muffled voices, and then, the booming voice again.
"I can't believe this!"
*** "WHAT?!?"
Tristian screams at them, "I can't believe what I am hearing, have you lost your minds completely?"
he puts his hands behind his head, lacing his fingers together and just leans back and stares at the ceiling, not believing anything he's hearing, this can't be happening to him.
He will go down in history as the royal that royally screws up the village.
"It's not as bad as you think, I swear."
Finlan is trying but just not helping at all, he's just as jumpy as Brigid, who is pacing back and forth in front of Tristian, his wings fidgeting as much as he is.
"I can't believe this."
It is all Tristian can manage to growl at them, rubbing his eyes with his thumb and middle finger.
He props his elbows on his desk and stares at them.
This is turning out to be one hell of a day, and with little sleep on top of it.
Brigid stops pacing and takes a deep breath, "we brought her here, and she's in the den across the hall, waiting to meet you."
Around his desk and out the door Tristian goes, the other two right on his heels, and into the other room.
He's trying to prepare himself for what he's going to see when he walks into the den; his mind goes in a million different directions at once.
He just keeps repeating to himself; please don't let it be her.
*** Zoe moves closer to Fionna for support and the door burst open.
In comes the most gorgeous man that Zoe has ever seen.
Hanging to his shoulders and slightly windblown is fabulous golden hair.
He stands slightly taller than the others with broad shoulders and a very sculptured chest with lean abs that are visible beneath the taunt dark green shirt.
His shorts show off the tan, lean, muscular legs.
She just stands there gaping at him, as he stands and glares at her, for what seems like an eternity.
Just breathe, Zoe thought, just breathe.
"I can't believe this."
He just keeps repeating as he starts pacing back and forth, his wings humming and his eyes never leaving Zoe.
There she stands, the auburn hair human, the most captivating woman Tristian has ever seen, with the wings of a pixie shimmering in the light coming from the window, making her hair sparkle.
From where he was sitting in the tree that night, he knew her eyes were pretty, but up close, they seem to take his breath away.
All he can do is pace the room, back and forth, before her.
"I can't believe this," he grumbles as he stares into those beautiful green eyes.
Fin stays close to the door but Brigid steps closer to get his attention.
"Tristian, this is Zoe," he nods toward her.
She curtsies slightly, not knowing what else to do under that stare.
It is coming from the deepest blue eyes she has ever seen.
They mesmerize her.
Their intensity is hypnotic as he stands and takes her in. "Nice to meet you," is all she can manage to squeak out with another small curtsy.
Tristian stops pacing long enough to blink a few times and walk back out the door.
Brigid and Fin close on his heels.
"Well that went well," Zoe croaks when the door closes behind them.
She and Fionna sit in the room for the next couple of hours as they listen to the muffled voices of the men.
Zoe helps herself to the cart of goodies since it is after lunch and no one has come to check on them.
She's beginning to believe they have forgotten them.
"What do you think is happening?"
she asks Fionna, while mindlessly nibbling on a pastry.
"Do you think we are in some kind of trouble?"
"No, I can't imagine why we should be, but this has never happened before.
Never in our known history have there been humans knowing that we were real, much less turning into one of us.
Now, I'm not sure what is going to happen."
Fionna said looking more worried than she tries to act.
"I am sure that it will be okay though, once we figure everything out."
"But if we are not supposed to know that you exist, where does that leave me?"
Zoe worries, putting the plate down and going to sit at the window.
She can see the sun, streaming down into the garden and sending shimmering reflections into the climbing vines from the small pools, giving an almost heavenly glow about the pathways.
"One thing at a time, we can cross that bridge when we get there."
Fionna sighs, she starts pacing, Zoe is too apprehensive to pace, she just sits by the window and mindlessly moves her new wings.
It seems to be getting easier the more she works at it.
At least she's not moving her shoulders as much anymore.
Still, she thinks the shimmer is cool; she has to give props to that.
CHAPTER SEVEN
As the guys enter Tristian's office, Brigid and Finlan sit in the chairs in front of his desk.
Once Tristian is calm, and sits, Brigid tells him the whole story, from how they visit the camp the first night, all the way to when they brought Zoe here.
"Tristian, I'm sorry, I have no idea what happened, we couldn't leave her there that way.
All we could do was get her here, keep her safe and wait for you."
Brigid said as he tries to calm himself down.
"I know Brigid, I'm sorry for losing it back there; I would have done the same thing.
It is just that I am not sure what to do now; they will be looking for her.
It's a huge risk to us."
He gets up again and starts pacing around the room, at this rate he will wear out his floor in no time.
The forest will be full of humans and tracking dogs, how can they keep the village safe with all of that going on.
"We kind of already took care of that," Finlan admits to him, "we have them thinking she's gone from the area for awhile and will be back soon."
Tristian turns his eyes on Finlan, opens his mouth to say something when Brigid speaks up.
"Look Tristian, I don't know the answers right now, but one thing I do know, she's very nervous and scared.
She's away from her friends and has been thrown into a world that, to her, was only make-believe just a couple of days ago.
Be careful please?"
Tristian looks back over to Brigid as he speaks, when he finishes, Tristian stops pacing and looks back and forth between the two of them, raises his eyebrows and says, "Follow me."
*** The door opens and the men come back into the room.
As Tristian walks in, he's still holding himself rigid, but no longer glaring at Zoe.
He comes up to her and holds out his hand.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to be so abrupt earlier.
I am Tristian, welcome to Devonshire."
She takes his hand, his warmth creeps up her arm as he bows, he never takes his eyes from hers; she has to give herself a mental shake.
"That's okay; I am a bit startled by the whole thing myself."
Zoe gives him a small smile.
His presence is very thrilling and he seems to fill the entire room with it.
"We have been going over what happened the night you changed.
Brigid and I will try to see if we can come up with some kind of reason.
Something in the story has to tell us what happened."
Tristian said, he's pacing again and more thinking to himself than actually talking to Zoe.
He's glancing around at everyone but looking at no one in particular.
"I'm sorry but I only have sketchy dreams from that night.
I feel like I will not be much help."
Zoe apologizes, walking across the room; she sits on the edge of the sofa next to Fionna, keeping her close for moral support.
"Well, can you tell me about the day then?
Maybe something in what you were doing can help up out.
Sometimes it takes a fresh look at things before something just jumps out at you."
Tristian stops pacing, he's just standing in front of Zoe, gazing down at her with those intense blue eyes.
He finally sits down on the sofa just across from her.
She spends the next couple of hours recapping the things leading up to the time of the change.
The time at breakfast, the hike to the waterfall and the lazy time in the creek just relaxing, she's even recapping the jokes and snuggling at the campfire.
Nothing seems to stand out as unusual.
She feels as if she left something out, but doesn't know what it can be.
The retelling of the whole day is bringing back her melancholy and making it harder to try to hide the sadness the others can obviously hear in her voice.
"It looks like we aren't going to get anywhere with this at the moment.
Why don't we call it a day?"
Tristian gives up for the day, he stands up and stretches his arms over his head, giving Zoe a real glimpse of his abs.
"Let's get something to eat and enjoy what's left of the sun."
Reaching out, taking Zoe by the hand, and lacing his fingers with hers, he leads them to the patio out back where they are placing a late lunch for them on the picnic tables.
Trellises, with climbing passionflowers weaving around in blue and purple, line the table area.
Tristian invites Zoe to take a walk around the grounds with him when they finish.
He's still holding her hand as they stroll through the pathways.
They start out admiring the reflection pools in the front.
Zoe is telling him about the ones in the courtyard where she works.
"The ones where I work are not as clear as these here; people tend to throw more than coins in them.
It is disgusting to see what they do to them.
I guess some of us humans are just not as appreciative of things as others."
She explains as they look into the pool.
"When you haven't been around nature like this, I guess you really don't know what you are missing," Zoe sits on the edge and reaches down to run her fingers through the water, making ripples flow across the smooth pool, blurring their reflection.
She looks up at Tristian, he's standing there propping his foot up on the edge of the pool, looking thoughtfully at her, "I guess I haven't stopped to think about how all of this is affecting you.
Seems like we are so caught up in what it might mean for us that we haven't really looked at it from your side."
He reaches to push a strand of hair from her face but stops.
Dropping his hand and putting his elbow on his knee, "Tell me, how are you coping?"
he raises back up and puts his hands in his back pockets to keep from reaching for her again.
"I'm not sure, to be honest.
I mean, everything seems so normal looking most of the time.
If it weren't for the wings, I might think I am in an Amish village or something."
Sighing, Zoe starts looking back into the pool and keeps talking, needing to make some kind of sense of her feelings, "When I woke up, I was terrified, thought I is losing my mind, or at least stuck in one of those weird dreams that you only read about in horror stories.
But now, after spending some time here with everyone and seeing everything, it hasn't been that bad.
I mean, I really miss my friends, but as long as they are okay, I can handle it.
How bad can it be, right?"
when she turns back to look at him he's still just standing there looking at her, like he really wants to say something but just can't find the words, the depth of his eyes drawing her into them.
***   Its dinnertime and they are all back at Fionna's house.
Tristian decides to stay and eat with them, to see if anything else comes to mind.
It is weird for Zoe, sitting with an actual Prince, what will her friends think of her now.
"Seems like we have come up with nothing new, why don't we go down to the camp?
Maybe something will come to us while we are there."
Tristian is talking more to the guys than anything.
"Please, can I come with you?
I really need to see them.
I need to know that they are okay."
Zoe begs, grabbing Tristian by the arm with both hands.
She has to get him to let her go, this is her chance to see how Garrett is taking the story that they gave him, her chance to see him again in who knows how long.
Finlan speaks up, "I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
We are going to go through the camp and see if we can spot anything out of the ordinary and..."
Zoe cuts him off in his train of thought, turning her glare toward him, "but how are you going to know if something is out of place?
Out of the ordinary?
It is my stuff; I should be able to go with you.
I know what we brought and what shouldn't be there, you don't."
