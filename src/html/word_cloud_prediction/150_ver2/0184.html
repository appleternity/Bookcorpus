In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent.

Publication normally involves a number of other events, such as editing and advertising of the Work, and mass production and sales of a represenation of the Work; thus in the most elaborated version of publication, there are a number of other potential roles, such as editor, publicist/advertizer, distributor, printer, etc., but none of these show up as separate, syntactically distinguished roles for the LUs in this frame.

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Behind_the_scenes', 'tfidf': 2.3211234668821845, 'lexical_unit': 'director.n / produce.v / cast.v', 'definition': "Artists work at various tasks that further the completion of a film, play, television show, or other similar Production.

This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.         The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.       The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.       Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.       Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance to other potential Audience members.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

said Dr Ramus, mirroring the Professor's performance with a squirrel retrieved from the final box.
"Do you mean to tell me she was not even your girlfriend?"
Dispensing with the cravat, the Professor took out a knife, dangled it by its handle against his groin, and began licking his lips and pouting at Dr Ramus.
"We hadn't reached that stage," he said, struggling to mask the anger in his voice as he gently twisted his wrist and turned the knife skyward as if it were a glorious erection brought on by the sight of his nemesis employing his furry towel to dry his nethers.
"You had not reached that stage?"
said Dr Ramus with an astonished--and somewhat sarcastic--air, as he sidestepped the spinning blade and dangled the squirrel from his crotch in readiness to once again mirror the Professor's previous actions.
But then he paused--his squirrel remaining flaccid.
"If you had not reached that stage, then I hardly stole her away from you did I?
Did you even know this woman?"
Almost immediately, the Professor's voice became as unexpectedly soft as his body had become unexpectedly limp.
"I was getting to know her..."
"Ugh," said Officer Penny, rolling up her eyes and groaning as she glanced between her two female companions.
"I think he's about to go into one."
"She was working as a receptionist in my family's company," said the Professor, aimlessly wandering over to his easel in order that he could reload his knife harness--like he was now on some kind of autopilot--his eyes as sad as they were distant.
"Here we go," said Officer Penny.
"I used to see her every day when I arrived at work.
She used to call me the Professor...
On account of my job."
"That explains the stupid name," said Karen, her voice kept so low that only the two females stood beside her could possibly hear.
"Duh," said Officer Penny, louder than Karen, but still only enough for her and Ginette to notice.
"That's why I chose 'the Professor' as the name I'm using now," said the Professor, oblivious to the fact that Karen or Officer Penny had even so much as opened their mouths, let alone spoken out of them.
"I'd always talk to her, and I think she liked me, but it was never easy.
She was always so preoccupied."
"Aw," said Karen, compassionately but with her voice still at a whisper, "wonder what she was so preoccupied with?"
"My father allowed her a small TV behind the desk.
She was always distracted by that.
Always watching the same kind of show."
"Wonder what kind?"
said Ginette, maintaining the low volume instigated by Karen.
"Those damned cooking shows that are on every hour of the day," said the Professor, gritting his teeth slightly, but so lost in his own thoughts, he now seemed completely unaware that anyone else was even anywhere near him.
"That explains why he killed the chefs," said Karen as quietly as before.
"But, even though it used to get to me, and had started affecting my work because I used to think about it so much, it's not like I could hold it against the chefs who presented the shows.
Not like I wanted to kill them or anything."
"Oh," said Karen, almost inaudibly as she tipped her scrunched face to one side.
"In fact, I used to try and joke about it.
Used to say to her: 'Well, better go now.
While you're sat there watching whoever it is today, cooking with whatever ingredients it is that anyone can go get from the supermarket, I'll be in my lab, cooking with the building blocks of life, and not so many people can do that'.
But, looking back, I'm not sure she ever really got it."
"She probably did," said Officer Penny quietly to Karen and Ginette, "it was just a shit joke."
"Maybe, it just wasn't a very good joke," said the Professor, looking even more solemn than before, "but then, one day, I said it and she just went crazy."
"So would I if I kept hearing it," said Penny to the other two.
"She said she was watching someone called James Frankley, and that, he could do more with a single baguette than I could ever do with anything in my lab--building blocks of life or whatever fancy name I had for them."
"Ah," said Karen very quietly, "that's when he got to wanting to kill the chefs.
And why he started with James Frankley."
"And," said Officer Penny, leaning over to Karen and whispering in her ear, "it probably explains why he stuffed a baguette up Frankley's ass."
"But, despite all that, I still couldn't really blame the chefs...
Would have liked to though.
Felt like taking a baguette and stuffing it straight up James Frankley's ass."
Shrugging their shoulders, Karen and Officer Penny just looked at each other, shaking their heads.
"Anyhow, things got real awkward and we didn't talk for a few days.
Decided I had to do something.
So, I took her some flowers and told her I'd like to invite her to dinner.
Dinner at mine.
And, I told her, not only was I cooking, I was gonna serve her whatever her favorite kind of food was.
No building blocks of life on the menu."
"Ugh," said Officer Penny, quietly, "he did the shit joke again."
"Wonder what her favorite kind of food was?"
whispered Ginette.
"Turns out her favorite food was Japanese," said the Professor, tipping his head back.
"Of all the things I didn't have a clue about.
But, I decided I wouldn't be beat, so went looking for a book and really thought my luck was in when I found one by someone I'd heard of.
A guy called Amos Finch.
Not a real Japanese person, obviously, but I was getting to know who she watched, and he was one of them, so it seemed perfect.
The recipes looked doable, so I bought it, planned what I was gonna cook, and invited her round."
"Wonder how it went?"
said Ginette, in another whisper to her two companions.
Albeit no less vacant, the Professor appeared slightly more cheerful.
"Turns out it went ok.
Nothing spectacular, but she ate the food, drank a little wine, and asked about what I'd prepared.
Plus, I'd managed to do a little reading from the other chefs she liked, so we had some other stuff to talk about.
Even cracked a little joke that made her laugh one time.
"Can't think it was the 'building blocks of life' one," whispered Officer Penny.
"Wonder if she stayed the night?"
said Ginette as quietly as before.
"She didn't stay the night or anything like that, but she seemed quite happy when she left, so I felt good about that.
Funny, I was awake half the night, wondering how things would be when I bumped into her at work the next day."
"Wonder how they were?"
whispered Ginette.
"Turns out they weren't so good," said the Professor, running his fingers against his forehead as he stared blankly at the ground.
"Not what I'd hoped for at all."
"Wonder why?"
said Ginette quietly.
"She shit herself at her desk," said the Professor, shaking his head somberly.
Ginette didn't say anything--nor did anyone else.
"Amos Finch's cookery book had a typo in it, and I'd left the sushi out of the refrigerator way too long.
Since I don't eat fish, I didn't have any, and that meant I didn't suffer the explosive diarrhea."
He paused for a moment, looking sad.
"She, on the other hand...
Well...
Let's just leave it at: she had to go home in a cab with a blanket wrapped around her waist."
Karen went to whisper something to her two companions but was interrupted as the Professor continued his ramblings.
"Didn't stop there either.
She had another bout in the car..."
Not sure where to look, the three women grimaced.
"It was a real big one too.
The cleaning bill from the taxi company was so huge, they attached photographic evidence to it.
To this day I don't know how so much could come out of someone that small."
The grimacing continued.
"The guy from their office told us we should be grateful we only had to see it and not breathe it in.
We challenged the bill, of course, but they had overwhelming--and I mean overwhelming--evidence that we were on the verge of having to buy them a new cab.
This way was, at least, slightly cheaper.
Then, of course, we had to make an out of court settlement with the driver to cover the costs of his therapy."
Staring into space for an extended period, the Professor had appeared to have finished.
"Ok," said Karen, quietly, "I think we now definitely know why he hates celebrity chefs.
Especially Amos Finch."
Officer Penny leant over and whispered in her ear.
"Probably also explains why the Sumo fed him that second-hand sushi or whatever it was he'd eaten."
"Thing is," said the Professor, resuming his ramblings, "although I thought Amos Finch was at least partly responsible, I still didn't hate him--" The women looked at each other and shook their heads again.
"Not then.
And, even after I did start to hate him, and had him killed...
Well--when I found out exactly what happened--I felt bad for him.
Hoshiko was only supposed to be suffocating him with his butt.
That thing that actually happened, that's no way for anyone to die..."
"And I suppose gasping for air under a Sumo's sweaty ass crack is?"
whispered Officer Penny to Karen and Ginette.
"What happened, well that was just sick.
I couldn't get any satisfaction from that.
You couldn't even laugh at that.
I mean, what kind of sick bastard would laugh at something like that?
You wouldn't laugh at that even if you read about it in a stupid made up book, let alone it happening in real life.
You know?
Like we're in.
Anyway, it certainly wasn't planned, and I couldn't have guessed in a million years it was gonna happen.
I didn't know Dr Ramus was gonna kick Hoshiko in the gut like that."
"Hey-ho," said Dr Ramus, quietly, as he awkwardly directed his gaze down towards the floor.
Leaning back, so that her lips were beside Karen and Officer Penny's ears, Ginette spoke softly.
"I don't get it.
I still don't understand why he hated those chefs or any other kind of celebrities or Dr Ramus."
"Anyhow, once she finally came back to work, well...
Things were awkward.
Real awkward.
But, I was trying to patch them up.
Trying real hard, until..."
The Professor's face betrayed yet more sadness.
"We had this problem in the company.
We'd been hit by some internal fraud, so my father called in a private detective from the city.
Turned out he was quite well known--had written quite a few books and been on TV."
"I think," said Officer Penny, in a low voice while shaking her head and rolling her eyes to the sky, "everything is about to all fall into place."
"Even before he'd arrived, she constantly had her nose in one of his books.
Wasn't watching chefs on TV anymore.
They were yesterday's news.
Then he showed..."
The majority of the group--even the three dim-witted male police officers--bit their lips as they roughly predicted the flavor of what was about to come.
"Next time I went to the desk, she wasn't there.
I needed an envelope, so I went to get one myself.
That's when I saw it...
"In the dimly lit back of our shabby walk-in stationery cupboard, long copper hair tumbled down the back of the unclothed female body that writhed up and down, back and forth, as its owner ardently straddled the man beneath her.
"I knew it was her--" "That'd be on account of her being ginger," whispered Officer Penny. "--and, although I couldn't see the face of the man underneath, I could see the expensive trousers and silk boxer shorts around his equally expensive socks.
And those damned ostentatious loafers he hadn't even bothered to take off.
Ostrich skin by the look of it.
