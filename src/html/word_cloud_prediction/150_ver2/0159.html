This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.         The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.       The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.       Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.       Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance to other potential Audience members.       Due to the high quality of previous Performances, Performers can become famous, i.e. well known and liked.  Those who like them particularly well become fans of the Performer.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

The size generally refers to the amount of three-dimensional space that is occupied by the Entity, not primarily to its weight, density, or length, which is why it is peculiar to refer to a bullet as "large", even if it is heavy, unless it actually has larger dimensions than usual, or to a rope as "big", even if it is long, unless its other, cross-sectional dimensions are also significant.  \'I own a very small home.\' \'Where is my little notebook?\' \'That dog is huge!\' \'\'  There are an enormous number of productive metaphors that involve this frame as the source domain; two of the most frequent metaphors come from the target domains of quantity/amount and importance.    \'He gave me a small sum of money.\' \'The novel was a substantial achievement.\' \'\'  Subcases of the quantity/amount and importance metaphors are also prominent. These involve cases describing the extent of an action\'s, event\'s, or person\'s effect ("his influence on her work was massive"), as well as those related to events ("big party"), similarity ("gigantic difference"), communication ("giant misunderstanding"), and emotions ("great joy", "little joys").  Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. "giant electronics company") and those describing sound volume ("in a tiny voice", "the enormous thundering of her heart").  \'\'  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a.

The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

Off-limits, dumbass.
Off-limits, I reminded myself.
I stared at the back of her body a little longer than necessary, then hung up on my sister just as I said, "Mornin'."
McKinsey jumped, then froze completely, and finally took in a deep breath before slowly turning around to face me.
My throat went dry.
Today, she was wearing makeup.
The dark liner around her big blue eyes made them look twice as intense, and I was smart enough to recognize what a goner I'd be if she were only a little older.
She licked her lips.
Hell, maybe I was a goner already.
"Good mornin'," I repeated.
I expected her to stammer and flush like she did whenever we ran into each other in the hall, but she surprised me.
"Do you like scaring the piss out of people?"
She leaned her shoulder against one of the white pillars behind her and lifted one of her eyebrows.
"Or do you just have a problem with me in particular?"
"Are you blaming me for you being distracted eighty percent of the time?"
I countered, following her eyes to see that they'd landed on the guitar and notepad beside me.
"Including right now."
She traced the curves and corners of the guitar slowly, her eyes appreciative.
"I've never seen a Gibson that looked like that," she admitted with a shrug and a little scrunch of her nose.
"What kind of--?"
She cleared her throat and rubbed her hand over her chest.
I forced myself to look at her face.
"What genre do you sing?"
"Country."
A soft smile tugged at her lips.
Even though my brain told me to shut the hell up and get inside the house, I kept talking because I wanted her to keep smiling.
"Well, a hybrid of country and rock."
She rocked forward on the toes of her tennis shoes then back, resting her shoulders to the pillar again.
"Figures."
"Figures?"
My phone vibrated, so I jammed it under a pillow.
Hazel could wait.
"Oh, Angel, you're going to have to explain."
Her breath noticeably hitched as she pushed away from the pillar and turned her back to me.
Raking her hand through her hair, she looped a hair tie through it until it was piled on the top of her head in a messy knot.
God, I'd love to pull that rubber band out just to twist all that blond hair through my fingers while I kissed her until she couldn't even string two words together.
Off-limits, dumbass.
Off-limits.
"I would explain."
She pulled her phone from her back pocket.
"But since Mrs. Hudson's out this morning, I've got to call my boss to take--" "No need," I said.
She looked over her shoulder at me, her big blue eyes surprised, and I had my keys out of my pocket before she could make another sound.
"I'll give you a ride."
Off-limits.
Off-- Aw, screw it.
Because when had I ever played by the rules?
Chapter Three Kinsey
With his striking green eyes, that dark mop of hair curling over his ears, and a bronze, ripped body that had driven me to distraction since he got here two days ago, Mrs. H's grandson was probably the most deliciously gorgeous guy I'd ever met in my entire life.
He was also the cockiest, because when I told him Liz had no problem dropping by the house to pick me up, he snatched my phone right out of my hands and walked right past me.
"What the hell are you doing?"
I ground out, shocked.
I tried not to focus on how sexy his departing form looked in jeans, a snug white tee, and boots (who the hell wore boots in June?), but it was hard not to stare at him as he strode toward the massive Ford-F250.
I'd admired the truck ever since he came to town, and everything about it suited him.
"What's it look like I'm doing, Angel?"
"Emmett?"
It was the first time I'd said his name out loud and doing so made my lips feel like they'd just been kissed.
Reaching the black truck, he opened the driver's door then turned to face me.
Even from several feet away, the challenge in the depths of his green eyes caused me to take a step back.
"I'm stopping you from putting someone out of their way," he drawled.
I opened my mouth to argue, but he shook his head as he climbed inside.
He was tall enough that he had no use for the chrome step bar.
"Get in," he ordered before closing the truck's door.
Hands on my hips, I stared daggers at him through the windshield, but he started the engine like my irritation didn't even faze him.
At the sight of me making no effort to move off the porch, he lowered the window and held something outside.
When I realized it was my phone he was wiggling around, I bit the inside of my cheek.
Obviously, I'd danced myself into this situation with an innocent little comment about his genre of music, so I blurted out, "I only said 'figures' because you're like the epitome of what I think of when I imagine a country music bad boy."
Thick accent, sexy jeans and boots, giant pickup truck.
Yeah, he was the whole package.
"All you're missing is a giant belt buckle and a cowboy hat."
His grin widened, and my heart pounded pitifully harder.
God, the man oozed charm.
No doubt he'd have his fans eating out the palms of his hands someday and throwing themselves at his boot-wearing feet.
"About that ride, I'd rather--" "To be honest, I'll take a baseball cap any day over a damn cowboy hat," he drawled.
"Now get in, McKinsey."
The fact he'd already seen me naked--a total accident to hear him tell it--made me want to dropkick myself for climbing into the truck a minute later, but luckily, there was enough space in the cab to fit two other people between our bodies.
Still, being so close to him, breathing in the woodsy scent of his cologne, feeling his hot stare sweep over my body as I secured my seatbelt--it unnerved me.
"Thanks for driving me."
I was desperate to make small talk as he drove up the long driveway.
"Mim wasn't home, and it would've been rude as hell not to offer."
When he reached the road, I pointed left.
"Stealing my phone wasn't exactly offering."
He lifted his broad shoulders.
A vivid memory of the tattoos spanning his muscular chest assaulted me, and I dug my fingers into the hem of my shorts, pulling at the fraying fabric.
Stupid-ass hormones.
The sooner he left for Dallas or Nashville or wherever the hell it was he was going next, the better for my body and brain.
"Don't worry, I'll give your phone back."
He glanced at my hands and smirked.
"So calm down."
"Yeah ... thanks."
I released my shorts, only to fidget with the key necklace dangling over the business logo on my tee shirt.
I nodded at the green street sign up ahead.
"Turn right up there."
"So ...
Samson's Nursery.
Kids?
Plants?"
"Definitely plants.
Mrs.
H helped me get the job when I came to live with her last year.
Figured I should start saving money, just in case..."
I swallowed hard when his head whipped in my direction.
Touching my throat, I asked, "Why are you looking at me like that?"
Drumming the steering wheel along with the song playing on the radio, he returned his beautiful green stare to the road.
"Because I'm waiting to hear what you've got to say."
I took a tremulous breath, and before I could stop myself, said, "My parents are in and out of jail.
My only sibling is a brother who is sixteen years younger than I am, and he was adopted last year because ... well, my parents couldn't and wouldn't take care of him.
I've got aunts and uncles and cousins, but I'm in the system, plus I'm eighteen."
He turned toward me again, but I quickly glanced away, staring at the giant Ford emblem on the dashboard because I was terrified of what I'd see in his eyes.
"What do you think I was about to say?"
His lips thinned into an unreadable line, but instead of pressing me for more details about my daddy and mommy-issues, he completely changed the subject.
"How long have you been singing?"
"How do you know I--?"
I started, but then he turned off the radio and softly sang a couple measures of the song I was wailing along to the morning we met.
No wonder he has a record deal.
His voice--gritty and sexy and soulful--crept over me the same way my favorite Kings of Leon song did.
"And thanks for reminding me that you know exactly what my boobs look like."
"You're the one who brought up tits, Angel.
Not me."
My nipples tightened beneath my shirt and I crossed my arms over my chest.
"Lord, you're eloquent."
I jabbed a finger at the traffic light we were approaching.
"Make a left at Orange.
Samson's is about a mile up the road, on the right."
During the final few minutes of the ride, he steered the conversation back to music, which was more than all right with me.
Music was something I loved.
It was safe.
I learned that he'd released an indie album three years ago--when he was eighteen--but that his newest effort had the budget, label, and staff behind it that would catapult him to stardom.
"So when you're famous, I can say you gave me a ride to work."
"Yeah, well that voice of yours ain't nothing to shit on, Angel.
You'd put most of the stars I've met to shame."
Pulling into Samson's parking lot, he reached into the cup holder in his door and handed me my phone.
I held my breath as he placed it in my outstretched hand, the tips of his fingers brushing my palm.
His touch was soft, his fingertips rough, and his skin was warm.
Too warm.
Too much.
Don't be stupid, I warned myself.
"McKinsey?"
"Kinsey," I breathed and lifted my chin until our eyes locked.
He didn't move his hand from mine, so my voice shook when I added, "Only Mrs. H calls me McKinsey."
"How long are you planning to stay with Mim, Kinsey?"
The trance caused by our touching hands broke.
I pulled my brows together into a deep frown.
"Why?"
I asked.
"Because I don't want my grandmother to get hurt."
There was no malice behind his words, but they still stung.
I couldn't imagine hurting Mrs. H. Aside from Lyra, she was the only person who'd given a shit about me in years.
Emmett pulled his fingers away from mine and positioned his hands on the steering wheel.
"You get what I'm saying, Angel?"
"Kinsey," I reminded him.
