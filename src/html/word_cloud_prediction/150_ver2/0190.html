Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.  '}, {'frame': 'Activity_done_state', 'tfidf': 0.6107876735819692, 'lexical_unit': 'done.a / through.a / finished.a', 'definition': "An Agent has completed an Activity.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Being_located', 'tfidf': 1.2651375532150269, 'lexical_unit': 'lie.v / whereabouts.n / situated.a', 'definition': "A Theme is in a stable position with respect to a Location.

With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

                        <pre id="story_content">
Her mind raced and her veins throbbed with electricity.
Everything was going wrong.
She wanted to be more than friends with Dylan, and Ruby was going to ruin everything.
Dylan belonged to her, not Ruby.
She wanted him so badly that it ached.
That was it!
She closed her eyes as the words bounced around in her mind, over and over.
She was in love with Dylan Powers.
With that earth-shattering conclusion, her mood dipped and she slowed down to think.
Ruby could have anyone her heart desired, and there was absolutely no reason for her to be with Dylan.
Aspen, on the other hand, didn't own anything.
All of her clothes were hand-me-downs from Miriam, or thrift shop specials, and she hadn't possessed a thing when she was younger.
Her bedding was secondhand.
The Mickey Mouse clock was something she'd picked up in the dumpster one day.
She couldn't even keep her dad.
He'd been taken away from her too, and she hadn't had the chance to know him as she grew up.
Dads treated their little girls with love and care, and spoiled them as much as possible.
Not experiencing that hurt more than words could say.
Aspen's lip trembled and moisture spiked the corners of her eyes.
The dream catcher throbbed softly under her shirt, and she wondered how long it would be before someone would take that as well.
She wanted to curse and words bubbled up in her throat, but she bit her lip to keep them in. "Hey, you're squeezing my hand.
What's wrong?"
Aspen pulled her fingers back in shock.
The tightness in her chest must have spilled over, and she'd squeezed Ray's hand very hard.
"I'm sorry."
She sighed.
"I've got to get something.
I'll meet you in class after lunch."
With a disappointed look, he let her go and watched her walk away.
She ran into the bathroom and splashed cool water over her cheeks at the sink.
As she was drying her face with a paper towel, Sandy walked into the room.
"Ray just walked away with a lost look on his face."
She laughed and dropped her backpack on the counter.
"Don't lie.
Why would he look lost?"
"Maybe 'cause he has the hots for you?"
Aspen smiled weakly.
"He doesn't have the hots for me.
He's just a nice guy."
She threw the crumpled paper towel into the trash can.
"Hah, that's what you think.
He's crazy about you."
Sandy smiled and leaned back against the counter.
The door creaked open and Ruby walked into the restroom.
Aspen bent to pick up her backpack and stumbled for a second, but then stood upright with her shoulders drawn back.
"Hello, Halfling."
Ruby smiled and faced the mirror.
After a quick inspection, she smoothed her red bangs against her forehead.
Opening a shiny red lip gloss, she reapplied the color to her lips.
Aspen assumed the gloss needed to be replaced because half of it was probably still on Dylan's cheek.
Ruby met Aspen's eyes in the mirror.
"You did okay yesterday, but you've got so much to learn.
Power means nothing if you can't control it."
She puckered her lips at her reflection.
"You need to practice a lot more before you join our hunts.
You could have killed us all if we weren't behind you."
Aspen gasped.
Sandy stood next to Ruby at the sink and reached forward to grab her arm.
"How dare you say that to our princess?
Apologize now, you idiot."
Sandy was practically vibrating, she was so angry, and a small bolt of electricity left her fingers and gave Ruby a mild shock.
"Ouch!
Let go of me!"
she shouted.
Tiny flames licked over the surface of Ruby's skin and burned Sandy's hand, and Sandy dropped her grip instantly.
Her palm blistered for a second before the dream catcher around her neck healed it.
"You little witch.
That hurt!"
Sandy cried and balled her fist in order to blast Ruby.
"Stop it!"
Aspen shouted.
"Stop it right now, both of you.
I've had enough of everyone today."
Wisps of hair stood up on her neck as power spiked up and down her body in strong currents.
The two girls stopped fighting and turned to stare at her in disbelief.
"Okay, Aspen, we aren't fighting now.
Just relax."
Sandy spoke in a calming voice and watched Aspen anxiously.
"You started this," Ruby cried out.
"I just said she needed more practice, now look what you've done."
She stared at Aspen for a second longer and then stormed out of the bathroom as fast as she could.
"Calm down, Princess, don't get so upset.
You can come back down again."
Sandy's voice rang in the distance in Aspen's head as waves of anger crashed through her body.
She was mad at Ruby for being so close to Dylan, the only guy she liked in the whole world, and she was livid that her friend had been burned.
The power running through her veins fizzled and popped, and she cursed Ruby in her mind.
She was so angry that she barely heard Sandy speaking.
"Come down, Aspen.
You need to calm down."
It was then that she glanced at the mirror and saw the strangest sight.
A blue light flickered around her body like a neon sign, and she hovered in the air about two feet above the ground.
Her eyes were silver, and swirled like rough seas.
With a cry, she exhaled and dropped to the floor.
"Sandy," she cried.
"What's happening to me?"
The sound of the bathroom door slamming against the wall made her squeal as Dylan burst into the room.
"Aspen, are you all right?"
He dropped to the floor next to her and pulled her into his arms.
The excess electricity that itched up and down her skin arced into his body, and he winced for a second before smiling and closing his eyes.
"I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on.
This hasn't happened to me before."
She tried to crawl away from him to avoid shocking him.
Dylan's grip tightened on her arm.
"No, don't move.
It's fine."
He kept his eyes closed and drew her closer.
"Don't worry.
You've just had an overload of power.
It can be scary, but you'll learn to control it.
Let me absorb it for you."
The heat that radiated between them intensified, and she could feel the tension leave her body as a current buzzed between their arms.
After a few minutes, Dylan opened his eyes.
A neon glow burned around his pupils momentarily before the color switched back to blue.
"Let me take you home.
I don't think it's smart to stay at school."
He helped her up from the floor.
"That's a good idea," Sandy said.
She'd kept quiet while Dylan was holding Aspen, but now she held up her hand to wave at her friend.
"See you later."
Before Aspen could answer, Dylan touched his dream catcher and they were transported instantly to the driveway of her house.
She took a step back and steadied herself.
"How did you do that?"
"You can do it too.
I'll teach you tomorrow.
Come on, you need some food and a nice sugary drink."
He walked with her along the driveway.
Her mom's head peered out of the kitchen window.
"Aspen, what's wrong?"
she called.
"Nothing, Mom.
I just felt faint at school, that's all."
"Oh, my darling."
Norma's blond bob whipped up as she rushed to open the door and let them in. Dylan took a second to look around the room, and Aspen looked around to try to see it through his eyes.
A big clock hung on the wall above the white fridge, and a small wooden table stood in the middle of the floor with four chairs that were tucked neatly underneath it.
Although the kitchen was spotlessly clean, the cabinets were in desperate need of attention; they were clean but unvarnished, and the walls needed a new coat of paint.
He probably wondered why Aspen's stepfather hadn't tried to modernize the room.
"Come inside, honey.
I'll make you both a glass of sweet tea."
Norma seated her daughter and pulled a pitcher of tea from the fridge.
"What happened?
Are you okay?"
she asked as she removed glasses from the cabinet.
"It's all right, Mom," Aspen replied.
"It happened a while ago, and I feel a lot better now, thanks.
This is Dylan, by the way."
"Nice to meet you, ma'am."
He greeted her with an outstretched hand.
"I think Aspen needs a sandwich with that tea, if you don't mind.
It'll build up her strength."
"I couldn't agree more.
