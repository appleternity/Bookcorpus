Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

I yell.
"Leave him alone!
Don't you hurt him!"
I shout as blue Ult L-E intensifies and flares from my eyes like angry electrical waves.
I grow desperate as I lean against the couch, waiting for a chance to react.
No matter what, I have to save the boy even if it cost me my life.
I think of Preacher and my heart calls for my beloved as determination growls within me like a hungry tigress stalking a herd of antelope.
I'll soon sink my teeth into the Un-Men and annihilate them all!
They won't hurt anybody here.
I swear it!
Chapter Twenty-five In A Bad Spot 9:32 A.M...
Melissa Odin's safehouse...
Katharine's view...
Don't hurt Chad!
Don't hurt him!
He's all I have left.
I cover my head, lying face down on the floor as the other Un-men fire at me.
God, don't let him get hurt!
I can't lose him, not after Preacher.
I manage to peer around the couch again and see the two Pretty Boys marching towards Chad as they lift their guns and state, "Wound the boy so we may capture him."
"No!"
I yell again.
"Run, Chad!"
"The monsters!"
he mumbles unable to move for fear.
"They're the orange-eyed monsters!"
This isn't the first time he has met these nightmares.
I had hoped when I left him and Preacher, he would never have to see them again.
I should have never come here.
I should have listened to Kimberly and never gone to the funeral.
The three T-2s move on my position and speak with a South African accent, "There is no place for you to go, Pandora.
Surrender and we will take you alive."
I see a metal bat by the TV, so I crawl to it, grab the bat, and jerk the two game controllers from their connection to the game console.
I won't let anyone else die.
I'll save Chad.
I feel the Ultra-Epi surge through my body as I stand, and I see the glow of the blue Ult L-E as it flashes off the floor and reflects my determination.
I quickly throw the first controller at the T-2s and the second controller at the T-1s, and then I duck behind the couch, peer over it, and watch as they both strike their mark.
The first controller hits a T-2 in the brow, and the second controller strikes a Pretty Boy in the back of the head.
I stand again and take a few steps back from the couch as the two Pretty Boys turn from Chad, glance at the controller, and move towards me.
"No," one orders the other.
"Complete our other task first.
We must take the boy."
On the other side of the room, the three T-2s look at the controller at their feet and ask me, "What do you plan on gaining by attacking us with such a weapon?
You can not damage us with-" I run, step to the cushions, and leap over the couch as a tigress would leap over a fallen log once the chase for dinner began.
I rush the T-2s with the bat held high as if it's my claws, and then I swing.
They look up just as I swing, and I hit two of them.
The one closest to the front door takes the brunt of my attack, and I dent its metal skull near its left temple, impacting part of its automaton brain.
Black liquid trickles down its face, it drops a 9 mm magazine it held while reloading, and collapses to its knees.
Its body flails as power surges through its systems.
My attack also damages the second T-2's left robotic eye, and sparks shoot from the marred area as the mechanical sphere hangs out of its socket and dangles by a few wires.
The eyeball continues to move and look at me.
I glance at Chad as the two Pretty Boys turn toward him, and I yell, "Run!"
I helplessly watch as his lips quiver in terror and he remains petrified in place.
My heart sinks, fearing for the boy.
No matter what, I'll protect him as if he's my own cub.
One Pretty Boy states to the other, "Shoot him in the leg."
The two functioning T-2s insert a new magazine in their guns and say, "If you will not surrender, Pandora, then we must destroy you!"
"Chad!"
I shriek as I start for him, but then I hear the T-2s reload their guns and turn, swinging backward with my bat at the third T-2's head as if I'll claw off its face.
It catches the bat with its hand and states, "Your tactic will not work a second time."
The first T-2 with the damaged automaton brain powers down and reboots, and I sense that it has by-passed the impaired areas of its processor and then it powers back up.
It stands but has lost use of its left side.
The T-2 holsters its gun, unable to reload the weapon with only one arm as the third T-2 snatches the bat away from me and swings it.
I duck, grab the magazine the first T-2 dropped, and roll away from the T-2s.
The third and second T-2 open fire on me as I duck around the end of the couch.
They cease fire, and white particles from the couch's padding float in the air around me.
Stephanie's view...
I stand in front of the kitchen door and watch Pandora while the gun battle takes place.
As the carnage goes on around me, I realize another like myself exists.
Pandora's amazing!
I have to fight her.
She'll give me the challenge I've been waiting for, but the Council still has to give the order.
I almost can't wait.
She's like me, but only one of us can be the best.
I fist my hands, resisting the urge to attack her.
They have to give me the go ahead so that I can prove that I'm superior.
I've annihilated many opponents over the years and very few have given me any challenge.
Pandora, I believe, will be different; she is different.
She's like me.
I watch as the two T-1s lift their guns, taking aim not at Pandora but another.
The boy covers his face with his arms and cries out, and I snap out of my thoughts when I hear the boy scream.
For the first time since this battle started, I turn my attention away from Pandora and I look at the boy as the two T-1s aim for him.
A feeling comes over me, one I haven't felt in a long time.
It's panic.
They're about to hurt the boy and maybe even kill him, and...
"Chuck!"
I yell as I run and tackle him before the T-1s fire.
Katharine's view...
Before I can try and rescue Chad, the Pretty Boys fire and their bullets riddle the staircase.
I nearly die inside as I'm too late to save him, but then I see that Chad's fine.
He's more than fine.
He's safe.
The Pretty Boys cease their attack till they can identify the unknown woman who has run out in front of them.
Their programming, thanks to Kimberly, now prevents them from hurting civilians unless the Factory deems the individual expendable.
Stephanie shields the boy with her body as she turns and glares at the Pretty Boys.
The T-1s use their facial recognition software, and an alarm goes off inside their programming, identifying the woman as...
I lose my connection with the Pretty Boys.
They can't harm her because she's...
She's important somehow and...
I don't know why they can't destroy her.
The Pretty Boys turn to one another and search their programming for their next move as their current tactic has been barred.
I have to think fast.
I still have no gun, and they're too many people here for the Un-Men to use against me.
I really wish Kimberly was here.
I could use someone in a fight like this.
I look again to Stephanie as she protects Chad.
He's safe along with everyone else, and that's the most important thing at the moment, so I raise my hands and shout, "I surrender.
Don't shoot."
I stand from my position, unsure if they'll take me prisoner.
Stephanie's view...
I lift from the boy, kneel beside him, and quickly check to see if he's hit as I ask, "Chuck, are you fine?"
"Yeah, I think," he answers as he holds his bloody elbow where he scraped it on the floor.
"And my name's Chad."
He turns to me and asks, "What about you?"
"I'm fine," I reply when I'm satisfied he's not injured.
Katharine's view...
Andrews and Daniels stir and rise to their feet as the three T-2s focus on me, deciding my fate, and the T-2s state, "Take Pandora.
We will return to the Factory."
My heart slows, and my eyes lose their glow with the immediate danger gone, and the genetically altered adrenal gland ceases production of my Ultra-Epi.
The first T-2 limps to me, dragging its impaired left leg, then stops, and waves for me as it commands, "Come with me."
I walk toward it, trip on a cushion on the floor, fall forward, and catch myself on the injured T-2.
It helps me up with its good arm as it states, "Do not resist us."
I nod and put a hand behind my back.
The Pretty Boys join the other T-2s as the injured one escorts me to the couch.
The third T-2, the Team Leader of the five, turns to the Pretty Boys and informs them, "I cannot raise the Factory.
Try your I-Link."
The Pretty Boys' blazing orange dot-light blinks three times as they connect and after a few seconds, they reply in one accord, "We are also unable to raise the Factory.
What does protocol dictate?"
Stephanie's view...
I observe Pandora as the Pretty Boys move away from me and Chuck to join the others who have captured her.
I have a feeling the battle is way far from over and as much as I'd like to watch it play out, I better get the kid out of here.
"Come on," I tell him as I grab him by his uninjured arm and drag him towards the kitchen.
"Let's get out of here."
"What about Kat?"
Chuck questions me as he pulls in the opposite direction, stopping our escape.
"We have to help her!"
"Pandora can take care of herself," I tell him.
I notice Pandora tucks a gun into the back waistband of her pants.
She had grabbed the Un-Man's gun from its holster when she accidentally tripped and if I remember correctly, the gun's empty, so I have no idea what she's going to do with it.
I force the boy through the kitchen door.
Whatever she's going to do, I would like to see it.
I just have to get him to safety and then I can come back.
Katharine's view...
"There is no protocol set up for loss of communications with the Factory," the Team Leader states to the other four Un-Men around me.
"We must process this problem further."
It turns to the Pretty Boys and the second T-2 with the dangling eye, and then they connect through their I-Link and work the problem out together.
The injured T-2 orders me as it remains unlinked with its brethren, "Sit."
I sit on the couch and while its brethren work on the problem, the injured T-2 notices Andrews and Daniels are on their feet and going for their weapons.
"Leave the guns holstered," it commands.
"Do it, and it'll ignore you," I tell them.
