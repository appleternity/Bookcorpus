Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

These involve cases describing the extent of an action\'s, event\'s, or person\'s effect ("his influence on her work was massive"), as well as those related to events ("big party"), similarity ("gigantic difference"), communication ("giant misunderstanding"), and emotions ("great joy", "little joys").  Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. "giant electronics company") and those describing sound volume ("in a tiny voice", "the enormous thundering of her heart").  \'\'  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a. Maturity and age also occur in non-productive metaphors ("big boy", "little baby").'}];

He seemed nice, if a bit nervous to be talking to her without her mom around.
Kristie knew that her mother was smitten with him and that was all that mattered.
Her mom deserved to be happy.
The second floor of the new house had her room and her parents' at the other side plus a living area in the middle.
Gray apparently lived somewhere else.
It was a different style of house than she was used to, but she liked it - it matched her mom's desire for change after her father had been killed.
Kristie walked into her room.
It was decorated neatly, looking more like a hotel room than anything else.
Lionel had told her she could add anything she wanted to the room to make it hers, but she kind of liked the hotel vibe it had.
Kristie liked when rooms felt like hotel rooms.
For some reason, it always made her think of comfort and relaxation.
Her dorm room, cluttered with her own things, didn't make her think of that - she only felt stressed.
Kristie threw her bag on the bed, realizing the door shut next to it was an en suite bathroom.
Score.
Kristie gleefully began to tug off her clothes.
This might look like an older house on the outside, but some serious renovation had been done inside.
The cool air made her skin prickle and she sighed, feeling a little relaxed for the first time since she pulled into town.
She went over and opened the door to her bathroom - and screamed in surprise.
A man was getting out of the shower, completely nude.
His hair was cut close to his head and he was in incredible shape, with a strong-looking chest and arms.
He had tattoos all along his arms and down his back and was grinning at her.
Kristie stammered and yanked a towel off the rack nearby, covering herself quickly.
She was blushing hard as the man let his eyes roam all over her, clearly drinking her in.
"You must be Kristie," he said in a tone that meant he was Gray.
Kristie took a step back to let him pass her.
Gray was still fully naked, and she couldn't stop looking at him, her breath caught in her chest.
He looked amazing.
She felt a stirring in her hips that took her by surprise.
"What are you doing in here?"
she demanded in a tone that she hoped hid the feelings she was suddenly having.
Gray looked at her.
"Needed to shower.
Didn't know you'd want to join me."
He was looking at her in that way again - a way that Kristie had never been looked at before.
His eyes were virtually tugging the towel off of her so he could admire her.
Kristie tried to keep her eyes welded to his face, not wanting to look down and have him catch her staring at whatever he was packing.
The tattoos moved with him like poetry in motion.
The heat from her hips had spread out across her body, and she was breathing hard.
"I don't!
Please leave!"
"If you insist."
Gray lingered for a moment, admiring Kristie before snatching up his clothes he had shoved in a ball off to the side.
She hadn't noticed them there.
He slipped on his jeans, and she tried not to admire his butt as he walked out, shutting the door behind her.
Once he left, Kristie ran over and locked the door.
She could hear her mom downstairs.
She must have just gotten home.
Kristie let out a sigh and looked around her bedroom.
She made herself go over to the bathroom.
The shower door was still open and next to it was a tub.
Definitely renovated.
She shut the door behind her and locked it, just for good measure.
The bathroom was a little cramped since her mom had added the tub next to the shower but Kristie didn't mind.
She knew her mom had added the tub for her.
Kristie loved baths.
They always managed to relax her.
But now as she stared at the tub, she was too busy trying to control her breathing over Gray to relax.
*** Pamela was home and instantly began to ask Gray questions about Kristie.
He should have left before she got home.
He would have been able to, if he hadn't run into Kristie coming into her room.
He had thought she would have spent more time talking to his uncle before coming up.
As Pamela was making a salad and talking his ear off, Gray found himself thinking about Kristie.
He hadn't been expecting his aunt's daughter to look like that.
He shifted his feet uncomfortably, nodding with whatever Pamela was saying.
As soon as he had seen Kristie, sparks had flown between the two of them.
She had looked good.
Gray had checked out every inch of her as she had stuttered and grabbed that towel.
She had stirred something inside of him that wasn't easily stirred.
Gray was focused on what he had to do in life and, outside of one-night stands, he didn't mess around with girls.
They were a distraction and that wasn't what he needed right now.
But Kristie had made him rock hard.
He had thought of what it would have been like if he had just made a move on her right then and there.
Would she have gone along with it?
And what if she had?
How far would it have gone?
"Gray?"
His uncle's voice broke him out of his thoughts.
"How are things with the truck?"
Gray was grateful for the subject change.
*** Upstairs, Kristie sank into the tub and let out a small sigh of delight.
Her mom had even put bath salts next to the tub.
Always thoughtful, her mother.
Kristie used some and stretched out, closing her eyes.
She had turned off the bathroom light and the cloudy weather brought in a dim light that made her wish she could go to bed instead of going downstairs for dinner.
The thought of seeing Gray downstairs made her break out into a sweat.
What had she been doing, looking at him like that?
It was complete madness - as if something had overtaken her.
But she couldn't help but remember just how good he had looked coming out of the shower like that.
You need to get laid.
Kristie knew she was acting like a school girl.
She would go downstairs and face dinner like an adult.
Chapter Three By the time dinner started, Gray regretted staying.
He hated these family dinners.
They always felt forced.
His uncle and Pamela always asked what he was up to with the underlying vibe of, "What are you really doing with your life?"
in each question.
Kristie sat down across from him, avoiding his gaze.
Gray tried not to smile at her.
She had obviously felt something at seeing him naked and was trying to deal with it.
He hadn't expected her to be so hot either.
Her modesty appealed to him, different from the women in the Devil's Advocates who threw themselves at him.
He was silent through most of the dinner.
His uncle and Pamela peppered Kristie with questions about college.
Gray could see why his parents were trying so hard to get them to hang out together.
Kristie obviously rolled in another world from Gray entirely, one with tests and studying and going to class.
Gray had none of that on his plate.
"Doesn't that sound fun, Gray?"
his uncle asked, looking at him over his old glasses.
"No."
Pamela looked at Kristie, as if she was trying to have her back them up, but Kristie remained silent.
Gray hid a smirk and shoveled another mouthful of food in.
His uncle looked perplexed.
"It's never too late to go back to college."
"You can't go back to somewhere you didn't even go in the first place," Gray pointed out.
"And I dropped out of high school."
"You can always--" "I'm not going back," Gray snapped, feeling irritated - this was the last thing he wanted to discuss right now.
"Is it supposed to snow this week?"
Kristie chimed in. Gray appreciated her effort at trying to change the subject.
But his uncle kept on.
"I just think it'd be best if you got out of that motorcycle club you're always partaking in.
It is a waste of time--" Gray stood up, suddenly furious, and stared his uncle down.
"You don't know anything about the Devil's Advocates or what I do."
"I know you get arrested," his uncle retorted.
"And I had to pay bail to get you out."
"You two, please, if we can just..."
Pamela tried to speak but Gray was too irritated to listen and held up his hand to cut her off.
"You want me to be some sort of cookie cutter human being like Kristie - well, I'm not.
You've never been able to accept what I do or who I am."
"Who you are?"
his uncle thundered.
"You run in a gang; how am I supposed to be proud of that?"
"I'm alive and doing things I want to do instead of being a cog in a machine!"
Gray spat and took off away from the table, knocking the chair over as he stormed toward the front door.
He could hear his uncle yelling at him and Pamela trying to calm him down.
Kristie was silent.
Gray stormed out of the house, shutting the door behind him and heading off toward his motorcycle.
It was always a mistake to come here.
Why did he always fall for it?
His uncle wanted someone else to stand in for a son, and Gray would never fit in with what his uncle wanted.
Good thing he has Kristie.
His motorcycle came to life, and he roared down the street.
*** Kristie watched Gray storm off, suddenly understanding what her mother had been trying to tell her about him back in the casino.
Motorcycle gang?
She watched her mom try to calm Lionel down.
No wonder they were all so worried.
That was no joke.
She knew Lionel had meant well in bringing up college, but Gray had shut down instantly.
It probably had been brought up time after time and he was sick of hearing it.
Dinner resumed in a quiet fashion.
The conversation was dry and filled with long pauses.
