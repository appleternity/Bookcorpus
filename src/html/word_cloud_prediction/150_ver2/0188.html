That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).

In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

A Parameter may be mentioned that indicates in which respect the Activity is judged to be easy or difficult. \'\' Unmarked LUs of this frame indicate that something is easy, while LUs of this frame that mean the opposite of easy are marked with the semantic type "Negative", as in difficult.a, arduous.a, and a bitch.n.    \'(1) John is easy to please.\' \'(2) It is easy to get Alex annoyed.\' \'(3) Smithers is very tough for me to please.\' \'(4) VWs are easy to repair.\' \'(5) The dating of western sculpture is difficult.\' \'(6) In that kind of wind the course is physically very tricky.\' \'(7) The last question on the exam was hard. \' \'(8) The last one was a hard question to answer. \''}, {'frame': 'Simple_name', 'tfidf': 0.5214161432845974, 'lexical_unit': 'word.n / term.n', 'definition': "A Term is the linguistic sign conventionally used by a Speaker to refer to a type of Entity.  ' Perianth is a collective term for the outer whorls of the flower, which protect the reproductive parts during development.'  'The Polish word for it is czarnuszka'"}, {'frame': 'Cause_motion', 'tfidf': 0.5205725693359526, 'lexical_unit': 'pull.v / launch.v / hit.v', 'definition': 'An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

"Oh, where are my manners?
You are free to call me Harlan."
Harlan.
Jacques would remember that name.
He bent down to pick up his sword and heard a loud bang.
He looked up, and the vampire was gone.
He then heard a loud creaking noise.
He looked behind him, and the door Jacques had come through was once again open.
Jacques knew it was time to get back to his men.
Chapter 3 Jacques was glad to be outside once more.
While the air was warm and stale, its smell of death was mild in comparison.
The open world before him felt welcoming, though he wondered if that was due to the freedom to run in any direction, as he felt the inclination to do.
As he moved from the entryway, the door shut immediately behind him.
Not so much a slam, but a sound of wood scraping stone.
His mind went to his men, as he realized that didn't want to linger here any longer than he needed to.
He began walking briskly, not wanting to run.
He feared that running might put his men on alert and send the wrong message to anyone else watching.
He wanted to get to his men quickly.
He was a bit concerned his men had left and went to the village, as he was unsure how long he had been inside.
Given Harlan's response to that suggestion, he didn't want to find out what these vampires would do.
He soon had them in sight, to his relief.
They were right where he last left them.
Despite standing in place, they kept their focus on their surroundings, constantly moving their heads.
Jacques had ordered them not be on guard, but here they were, doing it anyways.
The curse of being a Hunter, Jacques thought.
Jacques wasn't upset that his men were on the lookout, despite them disobeying his orders.
He again reminded himself that if he were in that situation, he might be doing the same.
It was David who noticed him first, followed by the others a moment later.
Jacques slowed his stride to a normal pace.
They said nothing, nor did they move from their positions.
Jacques immediately noticed the candle.
It was still burning, but was only a quarter closer to the nail than when it was first lit.
He figured his time in the keep would take longer, and was a bit surprised it went by so quickly, though to him it felt like hours had passed.
All of them were standing in the dirt with the horses facing away from the keep.
Likely done in case they needed a fast getaway.
The land around them was mostly barren, with a lot of dead grass and only small patches of green here and there.
Off in the distance, one could overlook the village and all the green surrounding it.
Even in the dark, Jacques noted farms and animals roaming around.
Jacques turned his attention to the keep and saw a box sitting against the stone building.
He noted to himself that this was likely the wood Harlan had offered to him and his men.
Jacques turned his attention to his men.
Only Janusz and Savio returned his gaze, waiting for him to tell them what was going on.
"We are to stay for the night," Jacques stated.
Both Janusz and Savio's eyes lit up.
"I will get our things together.
Do they have a room big enough for all of us?"
Janusz asked.
Jacques hesitated.
"We're not staying in the keep."
"Oh, are we going to the village, then?"
Savio inquired.
Jacques was silent in response.
His men were as tough as they came.
Most of their time as Hunters was spent sleeping under the stars.
Never did they complained.
Once initiated, Templar Knights and Hunters took a vow of poverty.
However, Jacques knew that they needed a bed and a warm place to sleep once in a while, and several weeks without was a long time to ask of anyone.
Their journey from France to Poland did allow them to visit Jacques's family for a night.
Not long enough to relax, but enough that they could trade horses and sleep comfortably.
They would likely return to his family's village on their return trip, but even then, it wasn't enough time to unload their burdens.
"We've been asked to remain out here for the night.
We will make our camp here, and wait for their command to be seen again," Jacques stated.
Both Janusz and Savio went from joyful to serious.
They did their best not to show their disappointment, but Jacques could see their bodies become more stiff.
He knew they had hoped to spend the night in the keep.
There was nothing he could do but be the bearer of bad news.
"Here is a good place to be anyways.
I can easily keep guard," David interjected.
"That won't be necessary.
We have been guaranteed our safety tonight.
No harm will come to us," Jacques added.
David turned towards Jacques.
David wasn't one for talking unless absolutely necessary, but could have full conversations with his eyes.
His eyes told Jacques everything he needed to know.
The men always had someone on duty each night, and tonight was David's turn.
To not keep watch was a foreign concept.
Even in the comforts of their cottage in Avignon, there was always someone watching over them.
Jacques was unsure what to tell them.
He could try to reason with them, help them see that this was a chance to have a relaxing night.
Everyone needed to get some rest, as there was no telling what the next day would bring them.
Perhaps tomorrow Harlan would agree to help them, and they can get the nice warm bed and a hot meal, or they are denied and must travel back home.
Jacques really hoped the former would be the outcome, but feared it would be the latter.
No matter the outcome, both option required them to be at their best, and Jacques knew he'd rather have a few hours of sleep than none at all.
The best thing Jacques could do was keep them busy.
"Savio, tend to the horses.
Find them a patch of green.
Also check for any remaining food we might have in the saddle bags.
David, there is some wood in the box over there."
Jacques pointed towards the box.
"Grab a few pieces for a fire.
"Janusz, collect some dry grass to start a fire."
Everyone started moving.
Jacques began to clear a place for a fire.
The location seemed quite suitable for their stay tonight, with a nice flat area and large stones that appeared to form some sort of crude circle.
It was an ideal place as any for sleeping under the stars, better than hard ground for a bed or tree bark digging into your body as you leaned back.
Jacques saw Savio pull the horses to various spots where there was grass to eat.
He put each horse in its own place, which required keeping them at great distances from each other.
It wasn't ideal if they needed to leave in a hurry, but Harlan had assured their safety.
They might as well make sure the horses were well taken care of tonight.
Janusz was the first back with handfuls of grass, but David was soon behind him with a couple of pieces of wood.
David laid the wood in a pile for what would be a fire pit.
He immediately constructed a tower of wood, with the larger pieces on the outside and the smaller pieces, with chips and twigs, on the inside.
He built this four layers high.
Once David was done, Janusz piled the grass on top of the wooden tower.
Janusz grabbed the candle he had lit when Jacques had handed it to him before, and poked a blade of grass into the flame.
In no time, the grass had caught fire.
"Put that out," Jacques demanded.
Janusz looked up, confused.
He did what he was told and put out the piece of dead grass.
"The candle too," Jacques ordered.
"You told me to make a fire.
I'm just following orders," Janusz remarked.
"You are.
But I'd rather you use your book to start the fire, not the candle."
Janusz blew out the candle, harder than was necessary.
He set the candle on the ground next to the pile of wood.
He walked away in the direction of his horse.
While he was gone, David gathered some stones and placed them around the stack of wood.
By this time, Savio had returned.
Jacques noted his hands were empty.
"I looked in each of the saddle bags... there is no food left," Savio stated.
This wouldn't be the first time they went without food while traveling.
Food could only last so long, and no amount of rationing could change that.
At the very least, they would have a fire and some level of comfort.
"Very well.
Find a spot and get comfortable," Jacques ordered.
Both Savio and David found a place to sit.
All three of them began to slip off their red tunics and their cuir bouilli and lay it next to them.
They then untied their belts and cervellires and put them next to their armor, revealing their clothing underneath.
It was important that their armor was easy to slip on and off, as they needed to be ready for anything.
It was this reason they wore leather rather than metal.
Janusz returned with his book in hand.
His little book contained a little of everything that was helpful on their travels.
Each has their own copy, with handwritten notes about various things, including Bible verses and spells.
Janusz began to thumb through the pages.
It didn't take him long to find what he was looking for.
He closed his eyes, and began moving his lips.
His face was serene as he was saying something, but only to himself.
He would occasionally look at the book as if he was memorizing what it said.
Janusz opened his eyes and focused on the pile of dead grass.
He began speaking.
"High in sk-sky... the air comes... da-down.
Engulfs us all... circles us all.
Moisture gone, heat rise... heat will rise.
Make a spark, and... and cast the eyes.
Push from me, set abound.
Grow from light and life the ground."
Upon saying the last line, Janusz thrust his hand towards the ground, pointing all fingers in the direction of where he intended the flame to start.
Nothing happened.
Janusz looked at Jacques.
