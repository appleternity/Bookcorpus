That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

"You're not looking your best either," Catrin replied.
"And I'm staying here.
Kyrien needs my protection."
Chase looked Catrin in the eye and knew that arguing would do no good.
Then he saw a look of pain and guilt flash across her face.
"Sinjin?"
"He's fine," Chase said.
He saw relief in Catrin's eyes, but the guilt was still there.
"And Durin as well."
"That ornery rascal could survive just about anything, I do believe."
"Get back in here.
I don't care who you are.
You need rest!"
Millie's shouts drifted down to those below.
"I believe that would be your husband coming now."
Chapter 7
Followers are like leaves before a strong wind.
Leaders are the wind.
--Morif, soldier
* * *
Nearly a fortnight passed, and the darkness pressed them no further, though the dragons kept constant daylight vigil.
It seemed they were waiting for something, or someone.
The thoughts haunted Catrin.
Prios was busy running a hold in turmoil and under siege, though the times she saw him, there was tenderness in his eyes.
As they passed in the hall, he would reach out to her, their hands caressing each other, ever so briefly.
Sometimes she'd see Sinjin trailing her husband, watching everything he did.
Catrin had seen less of Sinjin, and it pained her.
There was guilt in his eyes, and she couldn't seem to convince him that she would forgive him for whatever it was.
Something haunted his eyes, and that troubled her more than anything else.
Knowing she needed to concentrate, Catrin quieted her mind.
Squinting, she winced at the pain of pushing her needle through the supple but thick leather once again.
She could have given this task to the seamstresses, but it would have been impossible to convey to them the image in her mind.
She often wished for Kyrien's skill at communicating in images and feelings.
Catrin could see every detail from any angle, as if he had implanted the memory of this object directly into her head.
A saddle!
Catrin could hardly believe it.
She was working on a saddle for Kyrien, and it was unlike any saddle Catrin had ever known.
Certainly the seat, cantle, pommel, and horn were similar, but there were no stirrups.
Instead there were multiple cups of leather and iron on the flaps that could be used in a similar fashion to stirrups.
So many details had flowed into Catrin's mind.
A collection of girths made with thick strands of wound cotton waited in a corner, but none of Catrin's many straps were complete.
First she needed metal rings with a flat edge on one side, which only Strom could provide.
Her childhood friend was far too busy, yet he refused to take on an apprentice, saying he was still an apprentice himself, though none would argue his skill with metal and fire.
He had mastered the art of bringing things to life from only a picture in his mind.
Wielding his hammer like a paintbrush, he created works of art.
Now, though, much of his time was spent making pot stands, candleholders, and anything else needed by the hundreds if not thousands of refugees now forced to live in the great hall.
After draping a roughspun sheet over the saddle, Catrin left her workshop, pulling the rawhide curtain to cover the doorway, not wanting rumors to spread.
She also didn't want to worry Sinjin, unable to imagine how he would feel about his mother riding Kyrien with the ferals and demons guarding the valleys.
The cool air turned warm as Catrin walked toward the forge, and with every step, the heat became more oppressive.
Sweat ran into Catrin's eyes well before she reached the smithy.
Within stood Strom and a man Catrin knew she should recognize, but she could not recall a single detail about him.
Hoping he would not engage her, she stepped into the smithy.
She needn't have worried.
Though people seemed to fear Catrin less these days, she rarely had to wait for anything.
Those in her path leaped to get out of her way, and it sometimes frightened her.
What had she become?
"If one more person asks me when their commission will be done, I'll throttle 'em," Strom said by way of greeting.
Catrin smiled.
"I'm sorry you have to make everyone else wait so that my requests are fulfilled."
She turned her head so he would see her grin.
"I know that must be terribly difficult for you."
"What makes you think I've made anyone wait on your account?"
"Well," Catrin said, knowing she was risking not getting the parts she needed anytime soon.
"I figured there must be some reason everyone was asking when their commissions would be ready.
Something must be slowing you down.
I figured it must be me."
Strom's dark skin glistened as he breathed heavily, and Catrin saw his face darken even more as he flushed.
"You've no idea how much time it takes to do what I do!
The next person who questions how long it takes to do things can forge their own cook pots!
Ungrateful lot.
To the fires with all of you!"
Catrin could no longer hold back her laughter, which only seemed to fuel Strom's anger.
"And you just stuff a melon in it.
I've heard about enough out of you.
Why, I ought to melt these down and put you to the back of the line!"
He stuffed a heavy bag into her hands, and she could hear the sound of rings and buckle pieces clinking against one another.
"Thank you, Strom."
"Get out of here before I change my mind!
If not for the fact that it would just make more work for me, I'd do it.
Now git!"
"I still need a sword, Strom."
"Don't make swords."
"Strom."
"The only thing swords are good for is killin' people.
Don't make swords," Strom said and turned his back to Catrin, returning to his anvil and a rod of metal glowing red and white in the forge.
"Swords can protect as well.
You know I don't want to kill anyone.
I just need to be able to defend myself."
"Why not retrieve that staff of yours?
It seemed to serve you quite well."
"I can't," Catrin said.
"It's ... alive now.
I can't just yank it up, cut away the growth, and walk off with it, now can I?"
"I'll make you a new staff, then."
Catrin sighed.
They'd had this argument before, and never had she won.
"Not even one as talented as you could re-create that staff.
It lay dormant for thousands of years and then bloomed when I planted its heel in stone.
No.
Not even you can replace the Staff of Life."
Part of her knew she was being unreasonable.
"I never said I'd create you another Staff of Life.
You must have rocks in your ears, and perhaps between them as well.
I said I'd make you a new staff."
"But a staff is not what I need.
Now I need a sword."
"Did the voices in your head tell you that?"
Strom asked, not looking at her.
"It's not like that.
I just know I need a sword.
That's all."
Strom waved a hand and grabbed his tongs.
There would be no more words spoken about it today, and she left him to his work, knowing she'd been partly correct about her requests causing him grief from his other customers.
If it weren't so important, she would have waited her turn, but this meant everything.
She didn't know exactly why; she just knew.
With Kyrien so close by, she'd begun to wonder which thoughts were her own and which belonged to her dragon.
Though many of these strange, new thoughts surprised her, she always seemed to agree with the course of action Kyrien desired.
It didn't seem to matter.
Strom's comment about her staff had been well aimed.
Part of her wanted nothing more than to rest her hands in the grooves left by her own fingers.
The memory of her grip biting into the flesh of the staff was one she'd rather not relive, but that event had linked her to the Staff of Life forever.
By some magic, she'd planted the Staff of Life within the Grove of the Elders, at the center of the destruction she herself had wrought.
The staff had given her the greatest gift of all.
It had taken root and bloomed.
Twenty-one acorns it had yielded, just enough to replant the mighty trees she had destroyed.
"I hope the day has greeted you well," Brother Vaughn said as he appeared from around the bend in the hall.
"It has, and for you as well."
"How are your hands today?
They were so red yesterday, I wanted to make you stop sewing, or at least let someone help you."
Catrin almost didn't want to bring her hands out of the pockets of her robes.
Her knuckles and thumbs were inflamed and swollen, her skin shiny and slick in places.
Knowing Brother Vaughn as she did--his persistence was legendary--she pulled her hands out slowly.
He didn't say anything at first.
He just sucked air in through his teeth.
"Come with me, young lady.
I have something for you."
Catrin wanted to say no, wanted to get back to her work, but she also knew the pain would hinder her progress.
Experience told her it was best to let Brother Vaughn help when he offered.
It was difficult to believe any single mind could contain so much knowledge, and he seemed to learn more each day.
"When I came across this, I didn't believe it would work, and there seemed no place where I could test it, but there is a shelf of rock just outside the viewing chambers where the air is always moving, always in the same direction.
It's a puzzle I haven't yet worked out, but that is beside the point.
What's important now is that it works."
"What works?"
Catrin asked, knowing it would do no good.
No one loved surprising people with his findings as much as Brother Vaughn.
He enjoyed seeing the looks on people's faces as much as he enjoyed solving monumental problems.
"You'll see," he said.
When they reached the viewing chamber, Brother Vaughn shot her a look of concern.
"I'm not going anywhere," she said with a sigh.
Perhaps if Kenward had returned with the metal-rich thrones, she might have ventured back onto the astral plane.
