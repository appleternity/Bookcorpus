LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.'

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves .

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

The doors pulled back and let the cart pass.
Babbit's ride had not ended.
Not the death he expected, splattered on the glass.
No.
Instead, the cart continued through the opening.
The wheels hit some unseen bump just past the door, and Babbit found himself again launched into the air.
The cart separated and crashed on the steps.
Thankfully it missed everyone milling about outside.
No one was hurt.
Babbit, however, was catapulted high over the heads of the crowd, which included patrons, police, firemen, channel 12.2 local news at 11:00, and worst of all the Head Librarian.
Babbit landed in the fountain.
Normally there would have been a splash but the weather had gotten colder over the past few hours since Babbit first arrived.
The top of the fountain had iced a bit.
Babbit slid across the center trying to stop himself from anymore, further unwanted adventures.
Then he noticed.
He had dropped The Book.
It must have happened when he landed.
There it was.
Only a few feet away.
Babbit leaned forward to get to his knees and rise.
"Crrr ick."
In the brief, handful, of heartbeats that passed, Babbit gave it his best shot.
There was just simply too much that happened all at once.
Everyone around that had witnessed what Babbit went through, tried to rush forward and lend a hand.
There was no way to tell them to hold off.
To please stay out of the fountain.
The ice was breaking, "Crr ick"  and The Book was in danger.
They could not have known.
The Book ended up a victim of mob kindness.
I, myself may have been among those that were trying to help Babbit that day.
Someone held up the book, once it had been discovered.
The head librarian was immediately on the offensive.
"That had better not have been a library book mister."
"No mam.
Just the story of the rest of my life."
Babbit answered back.
He did not know if he felt good or bad about the book being destroyed.
The water from the fountain had dissolved the ink on the pages, running everything together.
The upside, all those people were free.
The downside, The Boss may not see it as Babbit saving him from being connected to bad dealings.
Joseph had come out of the main library and now stood beside Ms. Green.
Maren came out a moment later, ready to arrest Babbit for something right there on the spot.
"Wait a moment officer, please."
Joseph spoke in a loud voice to catch everyone's attention near by.
"The pigeon problem is handled.
Babbit there", Joseph pointed with his hand, "Is a hero!
He saved the Library."
Cheers went up all around!
Ms. Green looked a little skeptical, but obviously, without proof to the contrary, she believed him.
Mostly Ms. Green cared about the Library.
That was her first priority.
Ms.
Green was tired.
She had sent most everyone away already and prayed under her breath that tomorrow would be quieter at the Library.
As for Officer Maren, he could not really think of anything to say.
Babbit had not really broken any laws, he just looked guilty.
So he simply gave Babbit the look, you know the one that say's "Get lost!".
Joseph answered a few questions like a pro for the camera crew and then he waived them off.
Babbit had been through enough and there was probably a little more left to go.
Joseph and Babbit had to go home to his father's huge mansion.
They had to go and tell The Boss the book was gone.
Chapter Fourteen: See it my way.
Joseph helped Babbit get out of the pond, back to the truck and home.
Well, his sister's place anyway.
Babbit changed quickly and was grateful to be warm again.
The pond had been very cold.
Babbit stood in the living room and looked at his friend.
"I lost it.
He is going to kill me."
"Let's go, Babbit.
I won't let him!"
Babbit hugged his friend.
You know I don't think you should help me this time.
He gets so mad.
I don't want him mad at you when I am gone."
"Stop it, Babbit.
This is not the early 1900's and my father is not superhuman.
Let us go talk to him."
Joseph was set.
There was no way this was going to go badly.
He had seen all that Babbit did to save his father's book.
He did not even like the book, and really was glad it was gone.
Now he would have to convince his father that it did not matter.
Somehow!
"Okay, Joe."
Babbit wished his sister and nephew had been home so he could have hugged them goodbye.
It was better this way, however.
Joe could tell them some story and that would be easier for them.
Babbit hoped so anyway.
Joseph drove them both in the truck back over to the Pest Control company.
There they switched cars back to Joe's Chevy.
Now, Joe thought was a good time to gather his own confidence.
This was about Babbit no doubt, but more importantly, his father was just going to have to listen.
Joseph had things to say.
Important things.
The drive to The Boss's mansion was fairly silent.
Babbit was trying to find a nice way to say he failed, again.
Nothing he came up with in his head, put him in a good light.
Joseph cruised right, up the drive and parked at the front.
His Chevy was only a little out of place next to his father's Rolls.
Joseph did not care.
Like everything about his relationship with his father, Joseph's life just did not quite match up.
They walked up to the big house and went inside.
Then into the living room. together.
Joseph and his best friend Babbit.
Joseph knew this was the time, now or never.
He was ready, to take a stand.
After the sale of his invention, Joseph would have enough money to be able to buy a small island in the Pacific or a giant chunk of Florida.
He was going to make his father retire.
It was about time.
If his father wanted to keep working, he could work for his own son.
That will impress him.
I know it will.
Joe thought silently.
Marta came around the corner.
"Excuse me, boys.
The Boss is in the parlor.
Would you like something to drink before you go in?"
She smiled.
"Marta, how long have you been working for my Dad?"
A bright light went on behind Joseph's eyes.
An idea.
An idea worth expanding on.
"Joseph I have been here since your mom passed nearly twenty years ago."
She smiled shyly.
"Your mom was a wonderful lady and a good friend to me.
I miss her even now."
"You love my dad right?"
Joseph smiled.
He watched her face answer the question for her.
"Perfect".
He already knew the answer but it was nice to be sure.
"Stay close Marta.
Things are going to change fast around here."
Joseph smiled.
He really loved Marta too.
She had been a big part of his life growing up after his mom had passed away with cancer.
Joseph also knew how much his father loved Marta, but could not let go of his mom.
Passed or not, The Boss was not good with change.
So he never did anything about how he felt.
Showing his feelings was not easy for The Boss.
Joseph was more like his mom.
He understood.
Joseph was good with people because he understood such things.
Joseph took a deep breath and walked down the hall toward the Parlor.
Babbit and Marta were right behind him.
He was the first one to the double doors.
"Where is my Book?"
His father's rough, angry voice echoed down the hall all the way from the Parlor.
Joseph smiled at Marta, glanced at Babbit with a reassuring look and headed right in.
