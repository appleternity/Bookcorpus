This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Documents', 'tfidf': 1.2306315898895264, 'lexical_unit': 'ruling.n / contractual.a / document.n', 'definition': "Words in the frame refer to any Document that has a legal status or conventional social significance.

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.

This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Oblivious to their confusion, the woman continued.
"We were able to restructure the building for two downstairs suites.
If you'll follow me, I'll show you to your rooms and then we can help you get situated."
Not even Grace had a response to this new development.
There were more people in the lobby of the building than any of them had seen in the entire town in years.
"Go," Grace whispered.
Ryan pushed the wheelchair over the smooth, dark-stained hardwood floors.
"Now," the woman said as they turned into a hallway with two open doors on the left, the sun lighting the path, "the largest room here," the woman said, pointing to the first door, "is for the ladies.
The second room for the gentleman," the woman said as she walked to the other open door.
Looking at each other, Ryan and Nelson were confused as to which gentleman would occupy the room.
None of them moved.
Sensing their hesitation, the woman turned and led them, with help from information on her phone.
"Nelson," she said.
As if under her command, Nelson stood as straight as he ever had and waited for the woman to finish her instructions.
"Your room is here."
Nodding, Nelson hobbled toward the room as the others watched silently.
Peeking in the room, Nelson looked back at them.
Gritting his teeth, Ryan felt some tug in his chest as he watched a smile crack on Nelson's sullen face.
"Now," the woman said as Nelson entered his bright room, "you ladies will be in this room."
As the woman approached full of purpose, Ryan almost bumped into Mrs. Hargate as he stepped back pulling Grace in her wheelchair with him. Mrs. Hargate excused herself and allowed Ryan to pass.
The woman disappeared into the lit doorway and Ryan pulled the wheelchair beyond the door, then wheeled Grace into the bright room.
Hands covering her quivering mouth, Grace was speechless.
Pulling open the shades, the woman showed them the patio outside the French double-doors.
"There are misters out here," the woman said as she opened the doors and let the cool sprinkles filter in with the heat.
"Whew," she said, pulling the doors closed again.
"I'm sure you don't want to go out there until it gets cooler."
Busy fluffing pillows and directing workers to placement of furniture, the woman continued to talk as Ryan stepped aside.
Mrs.
Hargate slowly entered the room and blended in with the floral wallpaper.
It was a clean room that looked exactly like it was decorated and lived in by two elderly women.
Glass decorative dishes on a wooden coffee table in front of a floral stuffed couch and a wooden-backed rocking chair in the living area.
A cloth covered dining table with matching chairs and a buffet made up the dining room.
An archway in the wall led to a kitchen.
Two other doors led to the rooms.
"Tom and Brett will get you settled in," the woman said, looked at her phone then focused her attention on Ryan.
"Ryan," she said as she headed out the door, "follow me."
Without thinking, Ryan left the ladies to their new home and followed the woman who was led by whatever was on her phone.
Catching up, Ryan wanted to ask her many questions, but they hadn't formed yet.
Back in the heat, Ryan cringed as he adjusted and followed the woman as they crossed the road at another crosswalk.
Back on the other side, the woman made a right, took a quick look at work being done on the diner, then turned up the familiar stairs between the diner and General Store leading to the loft.
With heavy steps, Ryan followed the woman up the stairs.
There was no creaking.
Each footstep was met with a steady step.
Amazed, Ryan carefully tested each step as it withstood his weight without fuss.
Disappearing into the doorway, the woman did not wait for Ryan before informing him of his new surroundings.
"We didn't make many changes to the layout," Ryan heard as he stepped onto the landing and braced for what he would find beyond the door.
When he last left, Ryan had taken one last look.
The loft was just an open space with a kitchenette, a three-piece bathroom, some dining and living room furniture and a bed.
It was dark, even when the sun was shining bright through the south and west-facing windows.
It had been home for almost four years.
Squeezing his eyes tight at the memory, Ryan slowly opened his eyes, his fists tight, and his senses on alert.
It was the brightness that caught his attention.
Clean, bright blue walls met dark-stained hardwood floors.
There was a bed beneath the windows.
An actual bed with a headboard and footboard and a box-spring mattress.
"They had a little difficulty, but they were able to get a tub in the bathroom," the woman said as she opened the bathroom door, "it's nothing fancy, everything is new, the plumbing, the electrical."
Turning, the woman watched Ryan's reaction.
His old recliner had been replaced with two newer leather recliners flanking a glass coffee table on an area rug with a square geometric print.
The kitchen had a microwave above an oven, a refrigerator and an island with a sink.
There was even an appliance he had never seen before.
"That's a European-style washer/dryer," the woman explained as she placed a new set of keys on the island.
This was the loft of a single man in his thirties.
Looking down at her phone, the woman nodded her head.
"I know it's been an abrupt change," the woman said, finally taking a moment to speak directly to Ryan.
Slipping her hand in her over-the-shoulder sack, the woman pulled out an envelope for Ryan.
"This should explain some things," the woman said as she approached.
Holding it out for Ryan, she waited until he accepted the letter.
Barely holding it in his fingers, the envelope drooped from the weight of its contents so Ryan took it firmly in both hands before it fell to the floor.
"My name is Stella," the woman said as she reached into her bag and pulled out a business card.
Envelope firmly in his right hand, Ryan accepted the card and nodded as if he were mute.
"Hope you enjoy," the woman said cheerfully, "see you at the event this weekend," she informed Ryan.
Nodding mindlessly, Ryan stood by the door as the woman left for another project as directed by her phone.
The weight of the day finally overwhelmed Ryan and he took a few steps to the recliner and dropped onto the soft leather.
Placing the envelope and business card on his lap, Ryan felt for the button to recline the seat.
A motor whirred as he was lowered into a full reclining position.
A motorized recliner.
It was something he had missed.
Cool air from a silent air conditioner in the clean, bright room stirred memories that bubbled slowly, frothed in a comfortable foam in his aching head.
It was barely noon and Ryan just wanted to take a very long nap.
The contents of the envelope contained his every fear, sealed, stuffed with anxiety leaving little room on each side for a positive message.
A soft, warm breeze reminded him he had forgotten to close the door, and with a great groan, Ryan rolled himself over the arm of the recliner.
Stumbling to the door, he closed it.
There was a deadbolt above the handle with a lock.
Shrugging, Ryan dropped the envelope and card on the island then dropped back down on the recliner.
So many thoughts and fears and questions filled his head that he could not think about any one thing at all.
Before falling asleep, through drooping eyelids, Ryan saw something up the slope he had missed.
There was a car parked in front of the old hotel.
The old hotel as it must have looked when it first opened.
Another question, another thought for his tired mind.
As he slept, the questions and thoughts organized and Ryan woke extremely hungry.
There were oranges and apples in bowls on the countertop.
Dragging himself from the recliner, Ryan noticed the room was bright, but the outside was getting dark.
Looking up, Ryan saw track lighting.
With a great groan, he stretched then stumbled over to the stools under the island.
Apple in hand, Ryan looked at the stuffed envelope.
Biting into the juicy, green apple, Ryan crossed his arms and munched as he decided when to open the envelope.
Rocking in the swivel stool, Ryan thought about his fears.
Obviously, the heir mentioned in Howard's will had been tracked down.
Obviously, the new owner had intended to honor the provision that he and the others would be allowed to stay in Golden Peaks.
What concerned Ryan was the manner in which the new owner had carried out these provisions.
In his mind, Ryan could only put it in terms of a corporate takeover.
A new owner takes over.
The new owner reassures everyone there will be restructuring, no major changes.
The new owner fires the former leaders of the company.
The new owner then makes more major changes after a waiting period.
This was the waiting period.
This was the time when loyalties were tested.
Either accept the changes, or be forced out.
It was clever, if the new owner wanted to force them out.
There was nothing in the provision that stated how Ryan and the others would reside in Golden Peaks.
The new owner could make conditions intolerable for all of them so that Ryan and the others would leave of their own free wills.
But why the new apartments, Ryan wondered as he munched on his apple.
Maybe the new owner wanted to lull them into complacency to get the blight of the trailers off the property.
Then charge exorbitant rents.
That was what Ryan feared was in the package.
Some sort of rules and a severance package if he didn't like the new rules.
He hadn't even met the new owner, and Ryan already didn't like them.
Unable to handle the reality of whatever was in the envelope, Ryan decided he needed a walk.
Pushing himself away from the island, Ryan dropped the apple core in the contemporary trashcan and took the back steps toward the trailers.
Walking on the dirt road to the trailers, Ryan saw the minivan and realized he was just walking out of habit.
Making a left, he headed north toward the open road.
A brisk walk turned into a jog that turned into a run.
A run up the slope to Howard's grave.
Exhausted and dehydrated, Ryan turned and looked down on the town.
The town was alive again.
Howard was dead and the town was alive.
Shaking his head, Ryan looked over at the grave and he could still see Howard dead, slumped over the rocks not far from where he was buried.
In his view, there was something new.
Walking slowly up to the grave, there was a tall stone marker.
"HOWARD THORNBON ...
IN MEMORY."
A tombstone had been erected at the head of the grave.
A smile of gratitude involuntarily rose on his face and Ryan helped it into a joyful expression.
Breathing heavy, Ryan felt all the tension dissipate and he placed a hand on the tombstone.
"Thank you, Howard," Ryan said.
"They're very happy."
Humming.
Rustling.
Skittering.
Satisfied he had respected his old friend, Ryan headed back to town.
Walking along the road, Ryan saw a reflective green road sign.
"HOWARD WAY" Smiling, Ryan visited Nelson who just sat in his chair with a serene look on his tired face.
A man basking in his first moment of peace in a very long time.
There was no answer at Grace and Mrs. Hargate's door, so Ryan decided to visit in the morning.
It had been a tiring day for all of them.
As he walked up the road, Ryan realized he was whistling.
Each step was a wonder.
In the loft, Ryan was about to get undressed, but he realized people could potentially see him, so he went to the bathroom.
Walls had been moved to make it larger.
The tub was small, but it cooled Ryan off so it didn't matter.
