In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

He would become more than a poor Irish immigrant.
She would leave her husband.
He would woo her and win her.
They would be together at last, she in his arms.
That was the way all his dreams ended, she in his arms.
And that thought warmed him all the rest of the way to Biarritz Country Club.
* * * Conor was the first caddie into the yard.
He left his room earlier than normal anticipating the day and hoping he could get in a loop before the round with Meg Burke and Annie.
He always needed money, but now more than ever.
Money was the ticket to his dreams.
He sat on the bench lost in his thoughts for some time before Gino swung open the top of the Dutch door and saw him there.
"Hey, Mick," he called, "Come over here a second, wanna talk to you."
Conor rose and walked to the door.
"Morning, Cap'n," he offered.
"You have something for me this early?"
"No, something else."
He waved Conor closer.
"Listen, I got another goddamn phone call for you after you left.
It was Robert Graves.
He told me what he has you and Billy Compton up to."
"Lord!"
Conor let out, surprised the secret had been shared.
"Yeah, well, I think it's great.
I'd love to see one of my monkeys from the yard put it to some of those rich bastards.
So I'm gonna level with you.
Graves wants me to take care of you.
He wants you playing more than lugging bags.
So you're on the payroll as of today - five dollars a day.
But you gotta show up late in the day every day and play a few holes - you know, practice - until it gets dark.
I'll help sneak you out.
And you gotta play Mondays with Billy.
Of course, this is all just to the Calcutta you understand."
Conor was stunned.
He would have more cash than he'd had in months.
He'd be playing every day.
"Really, Cap'n?"
he asked.
"He said that?"
"I wouldn't be saying it now if he didn't, would I?
So I want you to get outta here.
Go get some breakfast or something and don't show up 'til five or so.
I don't want you around here where members can see you and ask for you.
Capisce?"
Conor suddenly panicked.
"But, Cap'n!
I have a loop this afternoon.
You know?
Mrs.
Graves, Mrs. Burke?
They're to be expecting me."
"I'll get 'em somebody else.
Don't worry about it.
I just told you, you don't have to caddie right now."
"No, really, I must.
And 'tis Mrs. Graves.
I can't be showing disrespect to the family, not after what they're to be doing for me," Conor said pleading hard now.
Gino considered the request carefully.
He too was on Grave's payroll through the Calcutta.
He had specific instructions.
Conor was to play and practice, not caddie.
Still, it was Mrs. Graves.
And she had put in a request for Conor last week.
"All right, all right.
What time are they playing today?
I don't have my tee sheet yet."
"Three o'clock," Conor replied quickly.
"All right, then, here's what you do," Gino ordered.
"Bring your clubs and stow them here.
I'll keep an eye on 'em.
But don't show up 'til the last minute.
And if Mrs. Graves asks, you're going to be going somewhere to practice after the round.
Got it?"
"Yes, I understand.
I'll do that."
"Yes you will.
'Cause I want you to practice something after that round.
Play as many holes as you can.
Or whatever.
But I want you out here working on whatever it is you do to get ready to play this stupid game."
"No, no.
I'll do that.
I can honest be about that.
I will practice."
"Good.
In fact, go ahead and tell her you're going to be practicing tonight.
Just don't tell her it's here."
"I understand.
I will do as you say, Cap'n."
With that Conor turned and started toward the gate.
Then he heard Gino's voice behind him.
"Mick, wait a minute.
Come back here."
Conor stopped, turned and returned to the door.
"Here, take this."
Gino extended his hand, his forefinger creasing a ten-dollar bill lengthwise into a vee.
"This is for yesterday and today per our Mr. Graves."
"Thank you!"
Conor exclaimed.
"'Tis to good use I can be putting this!"
Just then the gate opened and Blackie and Whitey entered, or tried to.
Arm-in-arm they had trouble negotiating the portal seeing as how they'd come straight from a night of doing whatever it was they did to begin the day as drunk as they were.
There was a ruffling and contorting of their bodies and some mumblings and curses before they made it through the gate and then staggered to the bench where they collapsed and almost instantly fell asleep still arm-in-arm.
Gino shook his head.
"I'm not paid enough," he muttered.
"Mick, come closer here."
Conor leaned across the shelf of the door to better hear Gino's whisper.
"One more thing.
I want you playing as long in the day as you can.
And so does Mr. Graves.
But if it gets too long, there's a place to stay here so you don't have to make the hike home.
You know about the Bogey House?"
"No, what's that?"
Conor asked, unsure where Gino was going.
"It's a bungalow up the lane just beyond the greenkeeper's barn - off to the right as you walk up to Valley Spring Road.
Members use it for various things, most of them no good.
If you decide to stay there look in the window next to the door.
If there's one candle or two burning in the window walk on by.
Those candles mean there's somebody inside.
If you do find it empty, light one candle in the window.
Nobody will bother you."
"What do two candles mean?"
"Means there's somebody inside that would be okay with somebody else joining them.
So don't you be lighting two.
The key's under the mat.
There's usually some food in the kitchen, too, in case you need to eat something.
Just don't make yourself a pig.
Lay off the booze.
And get out of there before daybreak.
I don't want no members finding a caddie staying in there.
Would mean my job more as likely.
Plus the green crew starts rolling in around five.
So you got that, Irish?
Just one candle?"
"Aye.
I do.
And I'm much obliged, Cap'n."
"Good.
Now get outta here."
Conor turned to leave.
When he got to the gate he ran into Dogface just coming through.
"Where you goin'?"
Dogface demanded as Conor moved to get past him.
Conor just shook his head and moved by.
Dogface looked to Gino.
"What's that about?"
he wondered as Conor closed the gate behind him.
