Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)

In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.

This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

It's not like I come up here all the time.
Not like Justus or Erway or Gallowing.
For chrissake, they're up here every other week, it seems.
Leave the old lady and the kids at home, you know, bring one of the secretaries, and I use that term loosely."
He glanced momentarily at the man sitting in the chair.
"Why did you have to find me?
They're up here a lot more than I am.
Why couldn't you find them instead?"
"Do you call or does someone call you?"
"I just call MacElroy and everything gets set up, no problem.
Flies me into Werkmann's, stocks the cabin, gets a guide if I want it, other companions if I want them."
"Is that your pickup?"
Jenny asked.
"Which one?"
"The Ford.
Or do you drive the Chevy?"
He shook his head.
"They're always just here.
Trucks, food, booze, guns, cabins, women."
He looked down again at the man sitting in the chair.
"A guide.
I don't have to do a thing.
It could be a nice setup."
"Who else comes up here?
Does MacElroy come?
Does he ever stay up here?"
The senator glanced over at Pat.
"MacElroy's a she.
Where've you been all your life?
Congresswoman!"
His words were beginning to slur.
He had now finished two big glasses of the Jack Daniels and had started on another but the contempt in his voice was clear.
"Why the hell'd they ever start letting the women in?
All they do is bitch and moan and stir up trouble.
Bunch of damned bleeding hearts!
You try to follow some kind of budget and they turn right around and spend what you know you're not gonna get.
They love spics and niggers and mothers with too many kids and kids with no daddy and daddies with no place to go home to.
That's what they spend it on, their time and our money.
They got committees for pregnant kids and committees for dirty winos and committees for tottering old ladies and committees for ... shit!"
He threw the glass in the sink.
It was plastic and bounced back out and went spinning across the floor.
"Write your goddam story.
Put my picture in it.
You want all the sordid details?
Then you go talk to Jones.
Or go back to Capital and catch MacElroy or better yet Longen.
Yeah, you go talk to Longen, that SOB snob!
Mr.
High'n'Mighty'd give you an earful.
They'll know all you want to know.
More'n you'd ever want to know!
But you won't get it out of them as easy as you did outta me.
They're tough and they're up there high enough you won't touch 'em.
Now get your smart ass outta here, hot shot!
G'wan.
Get out.
All of you!"
He punctuated his last sentence with a broad swipe of his arm, knocking bottles and glasses and kitchenware onto the linoleum with a clatter.
He took a clumsy step across the litter.
"Get out of here, I say!"
His arms and hands waved wildly as he stumbled toward them.
"Leave, vamoose, bug off!
I don't want you around no more!
Clear out, all of you!
Just leave me alone!"
He turned and sat dejectedly on the bed with his back to them.
The man in the robe was the first to move.
He got up and walked around Pat, out the door and back to his cabin.
Pat left right behind him and stood, waiting, in front of his pickup.
Jenny walked over and put her hand on the senator's shoulder.
"Will you be all right, Senator Roggins?
Can we give you a ride somewhere?
Let someone know so they can come pick you up?"
"Thank you, Brush, but no."
He shook his head slowly.
"You're not going in my direction but thank you anyway."
She squeezed his shoulder and left, pulling the door shut as well as she could behind her.
"Well," she demanded when they were both standing beside the pickup.
Pat made no response, looked back at the cabin, then opened the door and got in. Jenny did the same and they backed away from the woodpile they were headed toward and onto the road.
The ROAD CLOSED barricade was still as Jenny had left it the previous day and they went past without stopping.
Pat didn't stop at the asphalt, turned south toward Crossroad, the tires protesting as he worked his way through the gears.
As he did this, State Senator Vincent Roggins walked dizzily to the pickup and back, shuffling his feet and with stooped shoulders.
He left the door open and spent a little time cleaning the debris from the floor.
When he thought it looked presentable, he brushed the creases from his pants and inspected his jacket, standing in front of a mirror and carefully fastening each button.
He brushed a piece of lint from his lapel, pulled the white handkerchief a little higher up in the breast pocket and patted it, smoothed his hair back with the palm of both hands, walked to the kitchen and downed two more full glasses of Jack Daniels, lay back on the bed and fluffed several pillows under his head so he was comfortable.
He rested the shotgun on his chest, the muzzle under his chin, squeezed one lone drop from the corner of his eye, reached down and, just barely able to reach it, pushed both triggers.
Chapter 35
Pat braked hard to a stop in the no parking zone behind a white Porsche.
Normally he would have stopped and admired the car, but today he strode past it with never a glance and into the Park headquarters building.
He ignored the handful of visitors, didn't look out over the lake through the big, floor-to-ceiling windows, brushed past a surprised Ranger Kyle and the closed doors of the downstairs offices.
He took the stairs two at a time, ignored Suzanne Lemp busily working her IBM, and pushed open the door to David Jones' office.
Caroline Werkmann jumped off his desk where she had been sitting and almost into the Park director's lap.
She recovered as she turned and pulled at the hem of her skirt, smoothed it down the back and across the front.
David Jones looked up from his chair.
"You did it, didn't you?"
Pat said to the man, ignored the woman as she brushed a lock of hair back from her face.
"You pushed Werkmann off the cliff.
You swiped my camera and knocked me in the head, didn't you?
You came back up the utility's service road and gathered him up and put him in his own car and then pushed it over the edge.
You blew the mountain down on me when you saw I was catching on.
Or did you send out for Botts or Glenson to do that for you?
You sent them to rig my house, Bert told me that.
Did you know the DCI was coming or was that just a lucky break?"
"You're crazy!
I did no such thing!"
the director protested, now standing.
Pat ignored him.
"I just left Senator Roggins.
He has a very interesting story to tell.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take you with him when he goes down."
David Jones edged around the desk.
Pat reached down and took the lighter lying beside the little silver ash tray.
"How'd you get this back from Russell?"
Pat looked at it.
"Just like the one Roggins' guide has.
National Guard, I think he said it was.
When's your next weekend, Jones?
Will MacElroy be there or does she stay in Capital?
Or how about Longen?
Maybe he'll be there.
Or maybe it's better if the two of you never see each other, no one gets suspicious that way, do they?"
Pat took a step toward the director, holding out the lighter in his hand, and was surprised when Jones grabbed his arm, stepped under it and snapped it down.
All the memories came flooding back and Pat reacted without thinking, didn't try to pull his arm back but rolled forward and past the man, reversing the advantage as he did.
He twisted and came back up immediately on his feet.
Jones reached again, but this time Pat feinted, then grabbed the arm of the director, pulled it forward so Jones moved as Pat stepped to the side, still held the wrist as he brought his free forearm down heavy on the shoulder joint, pulled his opponent's arm back as he did so, separating the ball from the socket.
Air escaped from Jones' mouth but he found no voice.
Pain halted his thought process and his vision screened over with a web of tiny red lines.
He grabbed at the shoulder with his free hand, saw the floor come up and smash suddenly into his face.
He became aware of the pain in his legs and back, followed immediately by the pain in his nose and forehead.
His mouth filled with the salty taste of his own blood and he covered his head with the arm he could still move.
Pat straightened when he saw the man had no more fight left in him.
He clenched his teeth and both hands, exhaled and stepped back.
Caroline Werkmann, on the other hand, slipped off both shoes, lifted her skirt to free her legs, twirled, and kicked Pat in his spine, just above the tail bone.
His legs lost all sensation and he went to his knees.
She twirled again as he twisted his head to look at her.
It seemed as if the world had gone into slow motion.
He could see her smooth, shapely legs as she balanced on one, twirled and brought the other solidly into the side of his head.
The colors in the room went negative as her foot connected with his temple.
The ceiling light was black, the floor white, the person in front of him black as it bounced back a step.
He grabbed the edge of the desk to keep from falling and looked up.
He could feel the grass, rough and cold, beneath him, could see the glint of something as it moved in the moonlight, felt the pain as it connected with his head.
He could see the beautiful legs of Caroline Werkmann as they disappeared around the Lincoln, heard the Road Maggot lurch to life, sank back as they all disappeared into the night.
He was thinking in the past, didn't see Caroline Werkmann grab the little ivory-handled pistol from her purse lying on the desk, point it toward him, and pull the trigger.
He was aware of but didn't really feel the little piece of lead as it shattered his collarbone, ricocheted up and away from his head.
Thinking she had kicked him again, he brought both hands up in front of his face to ward off another blow.
The second shot entered his forearm, went easily through muscle and sinew and came to rest against the bone, close to his elbow.
He lost his balance and fell on his side between the desk and the visitor's chair, now dimly aware of his plight as he looked up and into the muzzle of the weapon held firmly in both her hands.
He didn't have even the strength to cover his face this time.
The third and last shot went wide as Jenny grabbed her arm and forced it up.
An animal hiss escaped the beautiful lips of Caroline Werkmann and she backed away and lifted her skirt again, ready to spin and deliver a blow on the woman in front of her.
