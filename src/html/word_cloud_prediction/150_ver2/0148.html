Especially when the Color designates a broad region in color-space, it may be defined with a specific Type, further specified by comparison to the color of a Comparand, modified by a Color_qualifier, or evaluated with a Descriptor.  All color words are generally used to specify the color of some (physical) Entity. 'I really like that shade of blue.' 'The welts on his side had already turned an angry red.'

Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.' 'Everyone stood as Captain Jack Aubrey delivered a toast.' 'Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is sticking to his guns .' 'Captain Mike Eruzione of the USA Miracle on Ice hockey team in 1980 turns 58 today.'  Most LUs of this frame are related to LUs of the Leadership or Kinship frames, but some (e.g. Lady, Mr., Brother) occur only here.

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Race_descriptor', 'tfidf': 0.6835682393375212, 'lexical_unit': 'asian.a / white.a / color.n', 'definition': "This frame covers LUs that describe the race of a Person.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Manipulation', 'tfidf': 0.6256405478828844, 'lexical_unit': 'seize.v / kiss.n / clasp.v', 'definition': "The words in this frame describe the manipulation of an Entity by an Agent.

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Stimulus_focus', 'tfidf': 0.5037468963254345, 'lexical_unit': 'pleasing.a / heartening.a / stupefying.a', 'definition': "In this frame either a Stimulus brings about a particular emotion or experience in the Experiencer or  saliently fails to bring about a particular experience.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Eventive_cognizer_affecting', 'tfidf': 1.7887716006576055, 'lexical_unit': 'decide.v / convince.v', 'definition': "An Event causes the Cognizer to accept some Content.

In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Morena asked.
"You're wearing his ring though."
"I didn't accept it at first.
I told him it was a bit much a bit too fast and I didn't want to give him a false sense of hope or lead him on."
Morena nodded, keeping silent.
Teresa continued.
"He insisted that I keep it.
He said that although he'd be disappointed and hurt if I decided I didn't want to marry him that he'd bought the ring for me and he wanted me to have it regardless."
Morena chuckled.
"You know how these men are, girl... once they give you a gift they damn near feel like they own you.
Something like an engagement ring... you never know... in his mind once you took that ring the wedding certificate was signed."
Teresa laughed.
"Girl, I know.
But if he goes flip mode on me he can have this thing back and go on about his business.
But I have a good feeling about this.
I'm taking my time but it feels good."
Morena placed her hands on Teresa's shoulders and rubbed her arms.
"Well, that's good for you."
Teresa smiled.
Morena continued.
"If James is your possible new future, why are you still grasping to the past?"
She motioned towards the ring dangling from the chain around Teresa's neck.
Subconsciously, Teresa reached for the ring and held it.
She closed her eyes and sighed.
"Black wasn't lying when he said we have a special connection.
I was.
I was in denial.
I just wanted to move on and forget he ever existed.
Not because I was bitter or I hated him, but because it was easier to forget him rather than to recognize that he is special to me and be forced to think of him knowing that I will never be with him again.
That make sense?"
"Sounds like you're still in love to me."
Teresa grimaced.
"Not at all.
We were friends before we were lovers.
I loved him before I was ever in love with him and the fact that he has come here and risked losing a woman as good as you to make sure I'm okay lets me know that he still loves me.
That doesn't mean he's in love with me.
I'm glad that he's accepted that.
I'm glad that he's met you.
I'm also glad that not only he, but you and James have all made me realize that it's okay for me to love him back.
And that is the reason I've kept his ring close to my heart.
Will I always keep it here or at all for that matter?
No, I'm sure I won't.
But right now it just feels right."
"It all sounds a little suspect to me but at least you were honest with me."
"You still want me to leave?"
Morena rolled her eyes.
"Girl, your little skinny tail is welcome here as long as you like."
"Thank you.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you."
"Did you tell Black about James yet?"
"No." "Hmmm."
"Hmmm what?"
"I've told Black he acts more like he's your father than anything and he does not like James at all.
Just curious how he'll react."
"Can you keep this between us?
It's awkward enough around here already.
It's like you said, these men want to act like they own you and I don't want to go through this big long speech with him like I did with you."
Morena bit into her bottom lip.
"Okay."
She turned to head back towards the kitchen.
Teresa placed her hand on the woman's shoulder.
Morena stopped and turned to face Teresa.
"Yes?"
"There's something else if you don't mind."
"Of course not."
"It's that whole patient client thing again."
Morena held her arm out gesturing towards the sofa.
"Let's sit."
She followed behind Teresa as she led the way towards the sofa and took a seat.
"What's on your mind?"
Morena asked crossing her legs as she sat beside Teresa.
"I haven't been sleeping...re-occurring nightmares.
I was hoping you could tell me what it means."
"I can try but you know dreams are open to interpretation."
"I understand."
"What happens in the dream?"
Teresa inhaled and slowly exhaled.
"I'm back in that basement of the police station and I'm being attacked again."
Morena sat quietly and listened staring back through un-judging eyes.
"I'm whimpering like a weak defeated dog," Teresa stated.
"You're no dog."
"Any way, as I plead with those animals the room becomes mute and off into the shadows I see a figure and hear a sound."
"A sound?"
"Yes.
I know it but I can't place it.
Girl that is the creepiest part of the dream.
It's like my mind is trying to tell me something and trying to figure out what that sound is... it's driving me insane."
"Can you describe the sound?"
Teresa drew in a long breath of air through her mouth.
"Like that."
"Like someone sucking through a straw?"
"Never thought of that.
Sort of but louder."
"Like what?
A vacuum cleaner?"
"No.
We can guess all day what the sound might have been.
I need you to tell me what the dream means."
"How did this dream leave you feeling?"
Teresa stood and began to pace the room.
"At first I felt afraid."
"Why did you have fear?
You said you only saw a shadow.
Did the shadow harm you in some way in the dream?"
"Physically, no."
"Then how so?"
"He, if it's a he... maybe a woman...
I don't know.
The thing harmed me mentally and emotionally.
I felt violated on another level.
I was being watched while being raped.
Like it was a matinee."
"What are the principal emotions arising from this dream?"
"Fear, anger... is creeped out an emotion?"
Teresa half-heartedly laughed.
"I can't truly answer the question of what your dream means.
Only you can in your waking hours.
You have experienced something that has taken root in your mind and has manifested itself in the form of a dream.
All I can say is be honest about your feelings and emotions.
In reality, your dreams will hardly ever tell you something that you don't already know on some level.
It's just more likely that you have been repressing or pushing something aside."
"How do I bring it to the forefront and put it behind me?"
"First thing I would suggest is stop looking at it as a negative.
It is not here to haunt you.
What has happened to you has already happened.
That occurrence can't hurt you anymore.
View your dream as a compass to what's going on in your life at the moment.
The key thing to remember is that there are no rules to dream interpretation and so there are no rights or wrongs to the interpretation process.
It's all down to your self-honesty, self-knowledge, and your willingness to apply your dream knowledge to your waking life situations."
"Thank you," Teresa said unsure of herself.
"I'll try."
"And take it back to the old school... warm tea and honey before bed always helps.
Take your mind to a happy place before bed, reminisce about a happy moment in your life, pray or meditate."
"I'll try."
"Good."
Morena stood and smiled before heading up to her room.
Teresa was left just as she was almost an hour ago, alone with her thoughts.
She wanted to believe that what Morena suggested would work but deep down she had a feeling that it wouldn't.
Chapter Eleven As Black pulled up to the government building where his office was located his vehicle was swamped with not only news reporters but also protesters.
He stepped out of his vehicle and began to move towards the entrance.
With his head held low and cameras flashing, he ignored the questions being hurled at him.
From the corner of his eye he spotted a bus pulling up with what he presumed to be more protestors, possibly from out of state.
Officers wearing riot gear armed with batons, mace, and police dogs advanced on the crowd.
Black found himself in the middle wedged between the police and the protestors.
None had made a move on the other and Black was praying that neither would, at least not with him in the middle.
He felt a tug at his left arm and a tug at his right as if he was being sandwiched in.
His head swiveled from left to right.
He spotted Waeltz to the left of him and James to the right.
They were acting as shields, escorting him to the entrance.
The sound of police on bullhorns and protesters yelling, "No Means No!"
