The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.  In both frames, such sentences should be tagged with the metaphor tag to differentiate them from literal sentences like "His eyes glistened with tears."  \'Her eyes glinted with hatred.\' \'I saw a light in her eyes at the mention of cookies.\' '}, {'frame': 'Capability', 'tfidf': 0.5763044363169203, 'lexical_unit': 'potential.a / capable.a / incapable.a', 'definition': "An Entity meets the pre-conditions for participating in an Event.

The size generally refers to the amount of three-dimensional space that is occupied by the Entity, not primarily to its weight, density, or length, which is why it is peculiar to refer to a bullet as "large", even if it is heavy, unless it actually has larger dimensions than usual, or to a rope as "big", even if it is long, unless its other, cross-sectional dimensions are also significant.  \'I own a very small home.\' \'Where is my little notebook?\' \'That dog is huge!\' \'\'  There are an enormous number of productive metaphors that involve this frame as the source domain; two of the most frequent metaphors come from the target domains of quantity/amount and importance.    \'He gave me a small sum of money.\' \'The novel was a substantial achievement.\' \'\'  Subcases of the quantity/amount and importance metaphors are also prominent. These involve cases describing the extent of an action\'s, event\'s, or person\'s effect ("his influence on her work was massive"), as well as those related to events ("big party"), similarity ("gigantic difference"), communication ("giant misunderstanding"), and emotions ("great joy", "little joys").

In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Most, but not all, LUs of this frame are usable in a context that implies a duty or responsibility, concepts related to the Being_obligated frame.

Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves .

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

"You didn't bring me to the war, I brought myself.
You must get out of here before they kill you," he said in a panic.
"Too late," she said.
Thelton's dark eyes widened.
"They killed you?"
he asked in disbelief.
"Does that mean they killed me too?"
Thelton could feel the pain slowly slip away.
With each minute that passed, he felt more and more relief.
"No, neither one of us dead.
What I meant was; I got hit with arrow."
"Where at?"
Thelton asked with concern.
The fire moved about their bodies in a rhythmic motion.
"In thigh."
Indy pointed at her thigh.
"Are you alright?"
"I am now."
"Good," he said.
There was silence for a moment.
More of his pain slipped away.
"I can't figure out where we are at or what is going on here."
Because he had lost so much blood, Thelton had lost sense with reality.
"We are at Firelake," Indy said.
"Firelake?
Firelake?"
He felt like he should know the word, but the idea of it still baffled him.
"You know what Firelake is?"
she said.
Thelton searched his brain until he found recollection.
Firelake!
Of course.
She had brought him here to save his life.
"Oh yeah!"
he said.
He remembered his mom.
Had she been real or had she been a dream.
He wondered if he was really at Firelake or if it was only a dream.
Indy closed her eyes and let the tranquility take her away.
"How did you know to rescue me?"
Thelton asked as he found more strength return.
"Your men called it destiny.
I don't know what means that.
I was with family and I missed you.
I wondered if you won war.
I decided to check.
I went to castle and found a battle going on.
There was killing everywhere.
I didn't like it and went to leave.
A man said he knew me.
He said he came over on the ship with us and saw you and I together.
He asked me if I wanted you.
I said yes.
Then we went looking for you.
He asked lots of men, until they finally helped me find you.
"When I reached you, you were on ground like you were dead.
I was scared.
I have seen dead before, and you looked it.
The men were wrapping material around your wounds.
Oh, they removed a few arrows too.
You screamed, and I knew you weren't dead.
They did lots of things to you.
Then someone asked me if I could fly.
I said yes.
They told me fly you to Firelake.
So I did, and here we are."
Thelton looked at Indy with much appreciation.
She had saved his life.
He smiled at the thought, then frowned "Did I want my life to be saved?"
he remembered how it felt to be with his mom.
"Indy should have let me die.
There is nothing in the lands compared to being with my mom.
Why hadn't Indy let me be?
If she hadn't interfered, I would be at peace, away from all the pain and hate."
At the moment, Thelton had conflicting feelings for Indy.
He was appreciative she saved his life, and he was angry she did.
He glared at her, but she didn't notice.
She had reclosed her eyes and had drifted into a better place.
Thelton hung to his anger as long as he could, but eventually the power of Firelake overcame his contention.
After several hours, the pain and anger was gone.
Thelton allowed himself to be completely consumed in peace and tranquility.
Chapter 26   Thelton and Indy spent three hours in the lake.
Their bodies had taken on rejuvenation and strength.
The only thing they had left to show for the war was the scars.
When they had finished healing, Indy flew them to the dragon camp.
It was strange for Thelton to return there.
He had been there two times before.
The first time he had entered the camp, he had come with the mission to kill Indy's mom, the queen dragon.
He would have too, if it hadn't been for Indy.
She had stopped him a split second before he had killed the queen.
The second time he had gone to the camp was to steal Indy away from Sterling.
He had felt so powerful at the time, sweeping in and taking her.
Now he was back at the camp.
As soon as Indy released Thelton from their flight, several of the male dragons came sniffing over to him.
She could see the hunger in their eyes.
Thelton could sense it as well.
Nervous, he quickly reached for his swords to attack, but they were gone.
"Imara, I don't think this is a good idea," he said using the name he had given Indy, swinging a stick in front of him.
He remembered how the dragons had chased after him.
Indy crouched down into fighting position between Thelton and the dragons while she spread her wings open to full span.
She growled and hissed as she paced back and forth in front of Thelton.
The dragons kept their distance, but they continued to circle around the two of them.
One of the dragons stepped too close, and Indy launched her long claws into his face.
She ripped away a flap of skin.
Although the dragon could have easily taken her, he stepped back, for she was family.
This display went on for a while, until slowly, each dragon walked away and went to another side of the camp.
Sweat poured down Indy's face and stung her eyes.
When all the dragons had retreated, she sat down, panting.
Thelton slid next to her, but he didn't let up his guard.
He held tightly to his stick.
Indy looked at Thelton and saw the color hadn't returned to his face.
"You were scared," she mocked.
She had rarely seen Thelton scared.
"No I wasn't, I could handle myself.
Don't forget, they call me the Dragon Slayer."
Indy's face turned sour.
"Don't you dare kill any of my family."
He remembered how sensitive she became when he had killed a dragon in front of her.
Thelton felt stupid for using his title in front of her.
Of course she wouldn't want to hear about all the dragons he had killed.
Having nothing else to say, they sat back to back, supporting each other in silence.
When night came, they went up into the tree house Sterling had built for Indy.
"Did you love him?"
Thelton asked as he examined the craftsmanship of the tree house.
He was very impressed by the quality of the work.
Sterling built it without any real tools.
He had done an impressive job.
"Did I love who?"
Indy asked.
"Did you love Sterling?"
Thelton asked as he spit out Sterling's name.
Thelton was playing games with her, and she didn't like it.
Of course she loved Sterling, just like she loved Thelton.
She decided to throw the game back at him.
"Did you love her?"
she asked, in reference to Princess Alashia.
Thelton got the hint, and let the subject go.
The two cuddled against each other for warmth and went to sleep.
Thelton slept all through the night and into the early morning.
It had been a long time since he had gotten such a good deep sleep.
When he woke up, he laid in the tree house, listening to the sounds of the Vegus Forest all around him.
Indy was gone.
Still tired, he drifted back to sleep.
When he awoke again, he could smell the savor of roasting meat.
It kind of smelt good, and horrifically stunk at the same time.
As he stretched, his joints creaked.
When he felt good and limber, he jumped out of the tree house and joined Indy by a fire she had built.
In the middle of the fire was a roasting troll.
Indy had learned from Thelton and Sterling how to roast an animal.
She could eat meat raw, and actually preferred it that way, but she had learned men liked to eat things cooked.
