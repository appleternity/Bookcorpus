Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

The size generally refers to the amount of three-dimensional space that is occupied by the Entity, not primarily to its weight, density, or length, which is why it is peculiar to refer to a bullet as "large", even if it is heavy, unless it actually has larger dimensions than usual, or to a rope as "big", even if it is long, unless its other, cross-sectional dimensions are also significant.  \'I own a very small home.\' \'Where is my little notebook?\' \'That dog is huge!\' \'\'  There are an enormous number of productive metaphors that involve this frame as the source domain; two of the most frequent metaphors come from the target domains of quantity/amount and importance.    \'He gave me a small sum of money.\' \'The novel was a substantial achievement.\' \'\'  Subcases of the quantity/amount and importance metaphors are also prominent. These involve cases describing the extent of an action\'s, event\'s, or person\'s effect ("his influence on her work was massive"), as well as those related to events ("big party"), similarity ("gigantic difference"), communication ("giant misunderstanding"), and emotions ("great joy", "little joys").  Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. "giant electronics company") and those describing sound volume ("in a tiny voice", "the enormous thundering of her heart").  \'\'  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a. Maturity and age also occur in non-productive metaphors ("big boy", "little baby").'}, {'frame': 'Visiting', 'tfidf': 0.9248495697975159, 'lexical_unit': 'visit.v / call.n / visit.n', 'definition': "An Agent matches location with an Entity in order to fulfill some  Purpose.  Quite often, the Purpose is social- or entertainment-oriented.  'I ca n't remember how many times he visited ! DNI' 'Now she was on an inspection visit .' 'You have to visit your parents every once in a while .'"}, {'frame': 'Intoxicants', 'tfidf': 0.9033594131469727, 'lexical_unit': 'freebase.n / cocaine.n / grass.n', 'definition': "An Intoxicant is ingested in order to achieve an altered state of consciousness. A Type or Descriptor may be indicated as well.  ' We smoked some high-grade marijuana.'  'They smoked freebase cocaine.'"}, {'frame': 'Calendric_unit', 'tfidf': 0.8925012350082397, 'lexical_unit': 'April.n / morning.n / Wednesday.n', 'definition': "Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

The healthy Chinese did not wait around for their sick countrymen.
When their guides were ready to leave, those not well enough to travel were left behind.
Amanda Medcroft was expecting another baby; however due to her pregnancy she was not permitted to offer her services as a volunteer.
She did not see much of Harry as he worked day and night, and all week long.
Amanda and Elizabeth Blakely had become firm friends; even though there was a marked difference in age and rank.
Towards the end of February, Elizabeth Blakely became ill.
Dr Maclagan was worried.
She had contracted some form of Eastern Dysentery from contact with the sick Chinese.
He commenced a course of treatment, however Elizabeth in her weakened state was not responding to the treatment Amanda Medcroft was saddened by this news.
She wanted to visit Elizabeth; but was not allowed anywhere near her friend.
She sat in her bedroom and reflected on their friendship.
Her mind drifted back to how they first met in January 1855.
"Amanda, I am home."
Harry called out as he stepped into his Customs' office adjacent to their lodgings.
"Would you like a cup of tea, Harry?"
"Yes, that will be good.
Have you had a good day?"
"Yes Harry, while you are having a cup of tea I will get the children ready for our dinner appointment with Captain Blakely and his family."
By 5:30 pm Harry and his family were ready for the walk up to Robe House.
Harry locked their front door and picked up Jason.
Amanda had baby Tristan tucked into his baby carriage.
They set off for Robe House.
Robe House had been constructed from local limestone blocks.
It was an imposing residence.
They were greeted at the door by a valet.
"Good evening Mr Medcroft.
Captain Blakely is expecting you.
Please follow me to the main drawing room."
Robe House was furnished in the typical fashion of houses in Queen Victoria's reign.
It was good quality furniture, but not ostentatious.
Phillip Blakely, his wife Elizabeth and their six children were waiting for them.
Amanda could sense from the atmosphere in the room that they were a close knit, loving family.
Captain Blakely seemed to be a likeable, fair sort of a person.
Mrs Blakely appeared to be a lively, compassionate, caring individual.
Their six children ranged from a toddler to teenagers.
Phillip Blakely spoke, "Mr and Mrs Medcroft, this is my wife Elizabeth and our children; Alicia, Amanda, Samuel, Jason, Sarah and Edward."
Harry spoke, "It is an honour to meet you Mrs Blakely.
This is my wife Amanda and our children Jason and Tristan."
He turned to Captain Blakely, "We want to thank you Sir, for your invitation to dine with you all."
"It is our pleasure Harry; now that the formalities are over we can get better acquainted."
Elizabeth Blakely made a bee line to baby Tristan.
"May I call you Amanda, you can call me Elizabeth."
"Yes, of course you can call me Amanda and I would be happy to call you Elizabeth."
The two oldest girls Alicia and Amanda also came over to fuss over baby Tristan.
Phillip Blakely and Harry conversed about the Customs' portfolio and Harry's other responsibilities as Harbourmaster and Receiver of Wrecks.
The valet entered discreetly to inform Captain Blakely the dinner was ready to be served.
"Well everyone dinner is ready.
Let us adjourn to the dining room."
The dining room was quite large with a long rectangular table able to accommodate twenty people.
Captain Blakely sat at the head with his wife and his four youngest children on his right.
Harry and his family sat on his left with the older children.
When dinner was over they all went outside to a side garden.
It was the time of year for long summer twilights.
The cool night air was invigorating.
The younger children played on the lawns.
Everyone else sat and enjoyed the coolness; happily conversing with each other.
As the twilight deepened Harry and Amanda excused themselves wanting to get home before dark.
They took their leave and went home; Jason and Tristan were both asleep.
The Medcrofts were glad to get home and go to bed.
It had been a long day.
From then on, Elizabeth Blakely often had Amanda and her children visit for morning tea; before the heat of the day set in.
While it was good to reflect on pleasant times; Amanda's thoughts returned to the present.
She found it hard to erase the reality of the dreadful illness that Elizabeth was suffering from.
She wished she could go and comfort her friend; it was distressing Amanda, she felt so helpless.
Dr Maclagan's concern deepened as the days went on.
Elizabeth's condition deteriorated.
Day by day she grew steadily worse.
Captain Blakely found it difficult to leave his official duties to be by his wife's side.
The incoming Chinese placed a heavy strain on the administration of Guichen Bay.
Captain Blakely's resources and the men under his command were really not sufficient for the ongoing situation.
He was thankful for the calibre of his people.
They worked day and night to keep things on an even keel.
Philip Blakely watched his wife's condition deteriorate each day.
Elizabeth was usually so full of life; now she lay listlessly in bed.
Unable to eat because of constant nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea she was losing weight dramatically.
Ongoing fever and accompanying sweats also made her life miserable.
She found it difficult to drink fluids; this exacerbated her already weakened condition.
Her children found the situation very distressing.
They felt helpless.
Their mother was so sick and she was not responding to treatment.
It was a worrying time for them all.
The townspeople rallied around the Blakely family to offer comfort and support.
As the month of March came along; it seemed inevitable that Elizabeth was dying.
She passed away on Sunday 8-March-1857.
Phillip Blakely sat by his wife's side.
Her breathing slowed down.
She slipped into a comatose state.
Long pauses between breaths became normal.
The hours dragged on interminably.
It was stressful waiting for his beloved wife to die.
A dry rattle in her throat as she drew each breath signalled the end was near.
He had seen men die on the battlefield, but this was extremely hard to bear.
He felt completely helpless and hopeless.
Elizabeth made a long sigh and her spirit departed.
Her body went limp and still.
She was gone.
The reality of her passing struck him forcibly.
Phillip Blakely was devastated by the loss of his soul mate.
He brought his children in for a last look at their mother.
They were numb with grief.
Tears poured down their faces.
It did not seem possible that their beloved mother was dead.
It was not fair!
Why did it have to be their mother?
A great outpouring of grief went through the town.
Even the Chinese were saddened by her death.
On the day of her funeral most of Robe Town was at her funeral ceremony.
All the businesses in town closed shop as a mark of respect to Elizabeth Blakely.
As the funeral cortege left Robe House a sad and solemn procession followed it to the cemetery, for the funeral service.
How poignant it was!
Elizabeth Blakely was the second person to be buried in the main part of the Robe Town cemetery.
Phillip Blakely found it hard to concentrate on day to day matters.
He was almost overwhelmed by grief.
However, his military training stood him in good stead.
The people of Guichen Bay District needed him to be a capable leader; with all these China ships arriving at Port Robe.
Animosity towards the Chinese increased.
The townspeople blamed them for Elizabeth Blakely's death.
If she had not had to nurse sick Chinese, she would be alive and well.
Dr Maclagan made the other volunteer ladies very aware that they needed to be careful about their personal hygiene.
In particular, they needed to wash their hands in clean water after contact with the sick.
Chapter 4 - The Long Journey
The Adelaide Times reported on 4-March-1857, that "...during the last few days, 260 Chinese were travelling on the Horsham and Lexton Road, 160 in the Upper Glenelg and a similar number by Casterton and Mt Sturgeon and nearly 300 were crossing the plains between Streatham and Ballaarat beside several smaller parties."
The Port Phillip Herald reported on the same day, "...one hundred and sixty four have landed from a vessel lately wrecked in Guichen Bay, arrived in Ballaarat yesterday after three weeks overland journey."
Of the 2,329 Chinese landing at Robe during January and February at least 700 were already in Victoria and 164 of them from the wrecked Phaeton had just arrived in Ballaarat.
Back in Robe Town a well known bullocky, John Edgeworth was finalising the unloading of a load of wool bales on to the Osprey.
His next venture would be to take another group of Chinese to the Victorian goldfields.
He was happy with his present circumstances; taking Chinese to the goldfields then picking up wool, or wheat, from Victorian stations on his return trip.
His wife Imelda appreciated their sudden change of fortune.
John's acting as a guide to the Chinese was very lucrative!
John's last trip had netted them about PS200.
He was hoping to make similar money this time.
Imelda had her heart set on a solid limestone house.
Soon they would be able to start construction.
She had already spoken to the local stonemason, Larry Cooper.
John Edgeworth was dependable, but easily provoked.
He had a quick temper and was not averse to using his fists.
His local watering hole was the Bush Inn on the outskirts of town; near the junction of the track to Penola and the track to the Coorong.
A bullocky's life was hard; often on the tracks in all sorts of weather.
Their use of colourful language was legendary.
They provided an essential service to the sheep stations, pastoralists and wheat farmers.
John had negotiated with a Chinese headman, Ah Wong to take a group of 300 Chinese to the Ballaarat goldfields.
He planned to leave in two days time.
Due to the untimely death of Elizabeth Blakely, and her subsequent funeral; John had out of respect put back his departure to Tuesday 10-March-1857.
The day dawned bright and sunny.
John brought his team and dray along Victoria Street; as close as he could to the Chinese camp.
The heavy items of baggage were loaded on to the dray.
Some sick Chinese were also hoisted aboard.
The rest of the Chinese were lined up single file along Davenport Street ready to follow John and his team.
Each Chinaman had a bamboo bow (pole) up to six feet long over one shoulder.
At each end of the bow was a basket with up to 35 pounds weight of belongings in each basket.
