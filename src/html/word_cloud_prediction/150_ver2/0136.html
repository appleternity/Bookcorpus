NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.

I know he is very proud of his daughter: why trouble him?
And, after all, what has she done amiss?
Many good Christians would treat me as she is doing.
Few like to associate with a liar."
"Really, Marjorie, you make me angry with you.
What sort of Christians did you live amongst before you came to Market Hawley?
No good person who claimed to be a Christian would act as she is doing.
Why, they daren't say their prayers if they did.
How could they pray for forgiveness?
'Forgive us our trespasses,' indeed!
No, no, hypocrites are not Christians.
There is no middle path."
Marjorie could not talk any more on the subject just then, for she had a letter to write to Nettie.
When she had written it she went out to post it, intending at the same time to walk a little distance along the road, for her head ached and she felt rather low-spirited.
Miss Macnab came to her door as she passed it, asked her which way she was going, and said she and Lion would follow her in a few minutes.
Having posted her letter, Marjorie walked slowly onwards.
It was not a very pleasant evening.
The sun had set, and there was a sort of grey light, which was not darkness and yet was not light.
The road was wet from recent rain, and the wind was beginning to rise steadily.
Not a very inviting evening for a walk, certainly, but Marjorie did not give much heed to physical discomfort.
She was thinking how Nettie would miss the money from Mrs. Newton's tuition, and she was wondering what she would do if she really was obliged to leave Market Hawley.
She might go back to London, or she might try another small town, but where could she ever again be so comfortable as she was here?
She would be so lonely in another place.
Miss Macnab was a true friend, and most of the people had been kind to her.
She shrank from beginning anew among strangers.
If she failed here altogether, Nettie would blame her for it, and no wonder.
She had explained all the circumstances to her, but that could not alter the fact, or make the unpleasant truth any the pleasanter.
Perhaps they would spend their Christmas together in London, after all; for if Mr. Absalom Marsh took the school from her, she could not remain more than a day after in Market Hawley.
"Ah, Miss Mowbray, and so you're thinkin' it's time you was sorry for takin' my situation from me!
I agrees with you, Miss.
How'll you like to have your situations took from you?
They're goin' fast, my dear.
And so you cheated us all, did you?
I said you wasn't fit to teach my innocent child, and I was right.
None o' your palaverin' for me.
Miss Marsh's the one for my money.
That reminds me, you owe me a lot o' money.
All the time you was teachin' my child, we was payin' you, and as Miss Marsh says, it was a waste o' our hard-earned coins, 'cause you couldn't teach her nothin'.
You didn't know a thing yourself, and you wasn't nothin' but a cheater."
The speaker, James Higgs, advanced nearer to the astonished Marjorie so that she could not escape from him.
He had seen her passing along the road while he himself was concealed behind a tree, and he had followed her some distance until he thought he would be safe from interruption; then he stopped her.
"Now, then," he continued, speaking in a low, threatening tone, "hand me over all the money you've got in your pocket, by way o' return for all we've spent on that child's schoolin'!
Do you hear?
Don't be long about it, neither.
There's no one as'll take your part this time, 'cause all the towns again' you.
I'll give you while I'm havin' a sup o' this stuff to empty your pockets; then if 'tisn't done, I'll empty 'em myself.
I mean to get drunk real bad on your money tonight.
I'm a bit on the road now."
He raised a black bottle to his lips as he concluded, and swallowed a portion of its fiery contents, watching Marjorie all the while.
"I have no money with me," she said indignantly, as she in part recovered from her fright.
"You are a coward to attack a woman.
Go on your way and let me pass.
I will call out for assistance."
"So you may, when I've emptied your pockets," he said, making a staggering movement forward and grasping her dress.
She cried out sharply, and then the road seemed to swim round and round her.
Chapter 13
Miss Louisa's Enmity Made Known "COURAGE, Marjorie, I am coming.
I'll soon settle that cowardly creature!"
Higgs turned half stupidly round at the sound of those words, and unloosed his hold of Marjorie's dress.
Then he felt himself clasped tightly round the knees.
The next moment he was lying in the mud.
Who had knocked him down?
Not a man, for there was no man near; he could see that, drunk as he was.
Not that dog Lion; there was no dog standing over him, with gleaming teeth ready to rend him.
But who was standing over him?
Why, little Miss Macnab, a huge stone held firmly in her hands.
"Now, then, if you attempt to move from that, I'll drop this stone on your head.
That will quiet you, I expect."
Her eyes flashed such angry scorn over him that he believed he felt their fire scorch him.
"How dare you come attacking a good, gentle woman like Miss Mowbray, you great drunken coward!
You're afraid to fight men, and you'd be afraid to fight me; but you annoy her because you know she won't even complain of your conduct.
Bah!
I waste time talking to a drunken thing like you.
If I had a good stick, I'd beat you so that you'd remember it for many a day.
Stir if you dare.
You know I'm afraid of no man.
I've no nice feeling of charity or humanity for such as you.
Marjorie, dear, get away home.
Don't mind me.
I'll wait till someone comes, and I'll have this creature locked up.
Why, Marjorie, have you fainted?
Dear, dear, what shall I do?
Would you stir, you wretch?
I'll drop this stone on you, surely."
She looked as if she would do so on the slightest provocation, or indeed without any provocation at all.
Her whole frame was quivering with indignation.
The man had sense enough to see that it was best to lie still.
He knew her well, as did many wife-beating factory men to their cost.
She had once emptied a large pot of boiling water over a cobbler who had beaten his wife almost to death.
That man did not "take the law o' her," as he threatened to do when his terrible wounds had healed, and he let his wife alone for many a day afterwards.
"If Lion were only here.
Marjorie, can't you get up, dear.
If I go to your assistance I must disable this wretch here.
Why did I send Lion on that errand?
Ah, here he is.
Lion, Lion, good fellow, come on quickly."
The Newfoundland came racing on at a gallop, and reached his mistress' side panting for breath.
When he perceived the man lying on the road, he looked down on him and uttered a growl.
"Yes, Lion, don't let him move from there till I tell you.
What a relief!"
And the little spinster dropped the huge stone, the weight of which had nearly dislocated her wrists.
"Miss Macnab and Miss Mowbray!"
exclaimed the astonished voice of Mr. Absalom Marsh, as that important individual suddenly appeared round the corner of the road, driving towards the town.
"Why, what is the matter here?"
"Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am so glad to see you.
Get down and lift Marjorie into your dogcart, and take her to my house quickly.
I'll soon be after you, And send a policeman out to lock up this creature.
Yes, that's Higgs.
He attacked her here, and I arrived barely in time to save her."
Mr. Marsh jumped down and raised Marjorie in his arms, placing her in the vacant seat in the dogcart.
She opened her eyes as the movement roused her, "Oh, I am well now, thank you," she said, smilingly.
"I can walk home.
It is Miss Macnab who ought to be here.
I'm sure she must be hurt."
"Not I, my dear.
I'm all right, and somewhat cooler too," and Miss Macnab laughed heartily.
"Lion will watch the man until the policeman arrives.
I declare, the wretch has fallen into a drunken sleep.
Well, he must be very drunk.
We can leave him here safely with Lion."
Full of indignation, Mr. Marsh turned and looked down at Higgs; then some of the anger died out of his eyes.
"I believe he has not many more days to live.
Drink is killing him."
Miss Macnab hurried home after the dogcart.
She was in haste to get her dress off, the sleeve of it had come into such close contact with the drunken man's garments.
"Pah, dirty creature!
I can never wear the dress again," she muttered, as she reached her own home.
Marjorie was sitting at the great blazing fire in the parlour, waiting for her, but she did not stop to speak to her.
She ran upstairs to her bedroom and changed her dress; then she tied up the discarded garment, and directed her maid to give it to some poor body.
That done, she entered the parlour and sat down placidly opposite Marjorie, and began to pour out tea.
"How did you knock him down?"
asked Marjorie, after a few minutes' quiet inspection of her hostess.
"Did Lion do it?"
Miss Macnab laughed.
"No, Lion was not with me at the first.
I just rushed at him, clasped him closely round the knees, and threw him backwards.
You must recollect he was drunk at the time, and taken unawares.
I always work myself up to such a pitch of indignation when I come upon any cowardly cruelty, that I often wonder I don't do more real harm to the wicked men.
Generally speaking, my tongue is weapon enough, but sometimes I am obliged to resort to physical force, and I have always been victorious.
Oh, you may laugh, but I have devices which make up for my lack of height and strength.
I consider I have done a good evening's work," she continued complacently, as she leaned back in her comfortable armchair and sipped her tea.
Marjorie looked at the frail old lady in amazement, but said nothing.
"Now we will have an end of Miss Louisa Marsh's persecution, and Mrs. Newton will be writing to beg you to continue teaching her children," Miss Macnab continued.
"I shall make everything plain to Mr. Absalom Marsh.
You needn't shake your head, my dear Marjorie.
Are you not afraid to oppose such a formidable personage as Maria Macnab?
Ah, here is Lion.
Of course that man is safe in custody.
Lion never only half does his work.
Well, good fellow, do you want your supper?"
