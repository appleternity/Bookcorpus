"Is there something wrong with my blood?"
I asked.
I was still completely unconvinced of this whole "good news" charade.
Fox smiled again, flashing his perfectly aligned and blindingly white teeth.
The oddest thought crossed my mind; I wondered if he ever drank coffee or soda?
"On the contrary, Claire," Fox replied.
"Your blood was found to be very...well... for lack of a better word, it is perfect."
Fox looked at me expectantly, but my reaction was obviously not what he anticipated.
"So...
What exactly does that mean?"
His eyes flashed to my mom and I felt the slightest stir in her body before he looked back at me.
"Human blood such as yours has not been in existence for hundreds of years.
The rarity and implications of this momentous discovery were quickly brought to the attention of the Vampire Royal Family.
Your blood, young Claire, is a phenomenon that has sent the entire royal family as well as the Vampire High Council into a frenzy.
It is most exciting, if I dare say so myself."
"You still haven't explained what this means for me.
What does it matter to the High Council what kind of blood I have?"
I bit my lip to restrain my anger when I felt my mom's hand squeezing my knee.
"Excuse me," Fox continued.
"Clearly, I have failed to properly explain the happy tidings of this situation.
There is no need for you to feel upset.
This is an occasion to celebrate."
"What should we be celebrating then?"
my mom asked as she looked at Fox expectantly.
"As I am sure you both well know, the blood received from donors supports the Vampire Royal Family and represents the trust, devotion and loyalty we share with them.
What many do not know, however, is for the vampires, blood donations are much more than that.
You are sustaining their immortal lives with your gracious gift.
Each donation must be carefully tested and then labeled for correct distribution.
Every vampire receives the blood that is most beneficial for them."
My mom interrupted him, expelling vampire history in a torrent of words.
"Vampire King Nicolae Noire created the system.
By providing vampires the blood that suits their individual needs, fewer feedings are required.
It was his research that eventually civilized our region and brought peace to our lands."
"Ahh, yes!
I see you possess an in-depth knowledge of vampire history."
Fox smiled at my mom and she giggled.
"Oh, I find it quite fascinating," she replied.
"I run the local vampire/human rights group.
We have new members joining all the time."
"Good, good.
Your efforts do not go unappreciated."
He turned his attention back to me.
"Now, shall I get down to business?
What I have been sent here to tell you, Claire, is not only an honor, but a privilege.
When the royal family was told about you, they could not hide their elation."
Fox rose, and walked over to me, kneeling with his head bowed.
I looked at my mom, wide-eyed, but she had no clue what he was doing.
Fox pulled a small box from his pocket and held it out to me.
"Bine ai venit, Claire."
My mom clasped her hands to her chest and her mouth fell open.
I didn't understand what Fox said, so I stared blankly at the box he held in his hand.
When he didn't move and remained kneeling, still bearing his offering, I tentatively took it from him.
I held it out before me as if it might burst into flames.
With all eyes on me, my heart hammering in my chest, and my mind swirling with countless scenarios for what the hell was going on, I lifted the lid.
Inside the small box was a pillow of red velvet, upon which lay a sparkling gold chain.
I lifted the delicate necklace and fastened my eyes on a small ruby dangling there.
It was exquisite, yet as pristine and new as it appeared.
I sensed the antiquity behind the item.
"It's magnificent," I said, in honesty and wonder.
"But why are you giving this to me?"
"Claire!
Show some manners."
My mom controlled her tone, but couldn't restrain the anger from reaching her eyes.
Fox waved her off.
"It is a gift from the royal family, Claire...
To their new daughter."
I instantly dropped the box and necklace onto the floor and had to bite my tongue to refrain from slinging a mouthful of profanity at him.
"What?"
"You have been chosen.
It is a rare honor for the family to welcome a new member and it heralds a time of great celebration.
Your presence will maximize the strength of our region.
Blood has a potency that comes not only from its ability to sustain, but in the power it represents.
Having another pure-blooded vampire would make our region a formidable force against any who seek to destroy us."
"Wait!
So, they want me to make them more powerful?
And who is seeking to destroy us?"
I couldn't wrap my head around what he was telling me.
The Vampire Royal Family wanted to adopt me?
This was crazy.
"There are those who do not agree with our way of life in this region.
They flaunt their hatred and try to poison our people."
Fox spat the words with such intense enmity that a tingling sensation, which I felt when I first saw him, returned.
"I don't get it, what could I possibly do?"
Fox picked up the necklace off the floor and handed it to me as gently as someone would a newborn child.
"You have been chosen, Claire.
You will join the Vampire Royal Family and be rewarded with the gift of immortality."
I collapsed in my seat in complete and utter shock.
I didn't know what to say to that.
I just turned eighteen and now was being offered immortality?
I had plans, I wanted to get my own place, find a boyfriend and a great job.
I didn't want any of this.
He had to be out of his mind.
I just sat there, shaking my head, fighting to restrain the stinging tears that were bound to fall.
"My daughter is going to be a vampire?"
my mom said, wrapping her arms around me.
Fox simply nodded, looking quite pleased with himself.
"Claire will live with the royal family, where she will begin her training and transformation."
I looked up, ready to protest, until I saw the fierce look in his eyes.
"Your mother will also be compensated.
Anything she will ever want or need, will be provided."
Fox handed my mom a thick envelope and she accepted it, still staring in shock.
"This is amazing," she said.
"My daughter is going to be a vampire."
Suddenly, she hugged me excitedly, jumping out of her seat and said we needed to celebrate and share our wonderful news.
"What if I don't want to?"
I asked Fox after my mom went into the kitchen, folding my arms defiantly.
"I'm sorry, Claire, but this is not a gift you can refuse."
"You can't just come in here and take away someone's life!"
I snapped back at him.
"You should feel honored to be presented with such an opportunity."
"But I have a life.
I have friends."
I started to sound pitiful as I realized there was no fighting it.
How could I refuse the ruler of our entire region, our vampire king?
I couldn't.
"Let us toast!"
my mom chimed in as she strolled back into the room, carrying three glasses filled with wine.
"To our king, and to the soon-to-be latest Vampire Royal Family member, my daughter, Claire!"
We each raised our glasses and drank, but I didn't share their expressions of happiness.
I felt trapped and could only wonder how I was going to say goodbye to my best friend and the life I intended to have for myself.
After listening politely to my mom rant about her political views, Fox allowed me the rest of the day to get my affairs in order.
By nightfall, I would have to have all my things packed and all my goodbyes to everyone said.
There was really only one person that I wanted to say goodbye to and that was Liz.
I had known her practically my whole life.
It wasn't like I was just moving away; it was more like I was going into the witness relocation program.
We would probably never see each other again.
When I reached her house, it was already buzzing with excitement.
Half the neighborhood had seen the limo on our street bearing the seal of the royal family.
She didn't even believe me at first, that they had come for me, until I pulled the gold and ruby necklace from my pocket.
Her shock instantly turned to sadness and I vowed that I would find a way to see her again.
I knew she wasn't really upset with me, but with the situation.
It wasn't just my life that Fox's revelation had forever changed, but those of my mom, Liz, and who knew who else?
Liz and I had dreams of going to college together and buying houses on the same street after we got married so our children could play together.
Liz and I wanted the whole fairytale life that we had dreamt up when we were little, but now it had been snatched away from us and I feared our friendship would never be the same.
I knew I would never be the same.
~
Chapter 3
Fox arrived at dusk, the black limo pulling to a smooth stop in front of my house.
After tonight, I could no longer call it my house anymore.
My mom helped me pack and talked animatedly the entire time as if I was just going off to college.
She was so wrapped up in her own excitement that she didn't even notice I never answered any of her questions, nor did I share any of her enthusiasm.
Only a day before, I discovered a new respect and admiration for the vampires.
Tonight, all I could feel for them was frustration and growing anger.
When Fox exited the limo, he walked in briskly without waiting for the door to be opened for him.
My bags were packed and I hesitated at the doorway to my bedroom, taking one last look, as I tried to recall every memory I ever had there.
I grabbed the carrier in which I put Louie and was surprised at how heavy he was.
They wanted to extract me from everything I knew and loved, but I wouldn't allow them to force me to leave him behind.
As I walked out the front door, Fox eyed the carrier and I shot him a defiant look.
He didn't say anything, which gave me a small sense of victory.
My mom stood at the end of our yard, waiting for me, and I suddenly felt so sad about leaving her.
