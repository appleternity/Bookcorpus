This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The Seller may have already decided on the amount of money that they would require, in which case it is called the Asking price.

The means by which the Seller indicates their wish to engage in an exchange are various, ranging from putting a price tag on an item on a store shelf, to advertizing, to communicating directly and specifically with a possible Buyer.  In some cases, however, the process may be initiated by the Buyer indicating to a possible Seller that they would like to make an exchange.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

"I will."
The next day, she drove into town with some of her cards and approached Jan at the bank.
Jan smiled and closed her station to lunch together.
"The thing is," Kat showed Jan the cards, "I have all these new Christmas designs but I don't know what to write in the cards.
I need someone like you who always knows just what to say.
And, I need to get them out right away, because people start buying their Christmas cards the week after Thanksgiving.
Can you help me?"
Jan asked, "Are you sure you want me to write the cards?"
"Of course, I can't think of a better person.
I need someone who can write words that reflect the true meaning of Christmas.
I know I can't do that, but I think you can."
Kat's lingering jealousy evaporated with Jan's smile.
"Let me see your designs again," Jan asked.
"I have ten different ones," Kat laid them out on the table.
"These are not your usual Christmas cards, but I think people will like them."
"They're gorgeous," Jan looked carefully at each one.
"I love this dove in the shape of a cross.
You have a very modern talent."
"That's what I mean.
They aren't your old fashioned Currier and Ives pictures."
"No, but I'm sure I can do this.
I'm already thinking of what I can write."
Kat said.
"I've even prayed about this.
Just a quick prayer before I came, but I think that this is something God will bless."
"God will certainly bless this," Jan said.
"I'll be careful to write something I know God loves to hear and wants people to read."
Jan touched her arm.
"I can't believe how wonderful this is.
I hope we sell a gazillion."
Kat smiled at her new friend.
"Me too."
Chapter 26
"It would be wrong of me to leave them here by themselves for Thanksgiving," Kat told Brent over the phone.
She glanced at her uncle sleeping on the chair.
"I don't know if this is going to work," Kat warned in defense of his complaints, exhausted by the wall of anger and frustration coming from the other end of the phone.
"Don't say that," Brent backed down.
"Of course it will work.
You need to come home and everything will be fine."
"My lease runs out in December."
"You can stay in the guest house here."
"And do what?"
Kat appealed to his reasoning.
"I don't care.
Do your card thing."
The disregard he showed for her efforts at starting a new career made her heart sink.
"Maybe I can come down after Thanksgiving."
Their phone calls were becoming increasingly difficult to get through.
All she wanted to do now is hang up.
Finally, they said good-bye.
"Don't you think we should put Uncle Ken in bed?"
she asked her Aunt Mary when she hung up the phone.
Her uncle looked uncomfortable with his head resting on his chin.
Beside him on the table was his Bible.
Ken had been dozing on and off since yesterday.
"Not yet.
The doctor said to keep him upright as much as possible to avoid pneumonia.
He's due to get up soon, anyway."
Mary shook her head in desperation.
"He can't catch up anymore."
Ken used to be able to sleep off his exhaustion and regain energy.
"He's always tired now.
It's not a good sign.
I think I will have to call hospice to help us."
"Hospice?
Hospice helps a person when they're dying."
The truth she feared all week finally spoken.
Mary took Kat's hand.
"You have to face this now Kat, or it will be more difficult for you in the end.
Your uncle is dying.
That's what is happening here.
His heart is growing weaker and weaker."
Kat grabbed her jacket and ran out to the large oak tree, it's brown leaves clinging stubbornly to the branches.
The sky was crystalline blue and the forest a carpet of gold and red.
For the first Sunday in a long time, her uncle had slept through their special time together.
Too weak to attend services himself, he now spent most Sunday mornings explaining to Kat how much God loved her.
Kat had grown to cherish Sunday mornings.
She put her head in her hands and cried.
"He's not even gone yet, and here I am grieving him already."
Her tears turned to joy when she returned to see Ken awake in the kitchen chair offering her to take the one beside him.
The ashen pallor of his skin had brightened with wakefulness.
She brought his Bible over to him but he laid it aside.
Ken said, "I rarely worry in this life, Kat.
I know that God will look after me, but that doesn't mean there haven't been times when I've felt alone.
Many times I wondered if God knew what was happening, because if He did, I thought he wouldn't allow it.
I felt that way when I became so sick a few months ago.
You changed everything for me, Kat."
"I did?"
Kat knew her aunt and uncle wanted her to come for a visit, but how could she have changed things?
Ken nodded.
"In you is the culmination of all my prayers.
I'm so proud of you, dear."
"What could you have prayed that I would be the answer to anything?"
Kat asked.
Her uncle wasn't making sense.
How could he be proud of her?
She was a miserable Christian, and guilty of abandoning her own mother the night of her death.
"There is nothing to be proud of in me."
"Not true.
I prayed for someone to give meaning to my life again.
A reason to live on.
Now I see that God has truly given me that in you.
I needed you.
In these last days, God has given me all that I need."
Kat gulped at the thickness growing in her throat.
"Uncle Ken, you had great meaning in your life.
You carried God's message to people who hungered for it.
You always shared your faith so courageously.
You went to church faithfully and served God with all your talents."
"Sometimes in our need to do something for God, we forget what he first asked us to do, that is, love others as ourselves.
Family should come first.
I always wondered if perhaps I should have moved down to Atlanta with you and Nora after my brother died but I let Nora shut the door on me.
I reminded her too much of what she had lost but I could have insisted, I could have broken her wall down.
I should have received what God had given me a little better.
When I saw you, scraped and bleeding, walking along the road to my house with Dade, and I heard the sadness of grief in your voice, I knew God had given me one last chance to be part of your life."
He put his hand on hers.
"I cared about you and your mother.
I should have visited you more in Atlanta.
I thought I had lost you but you came back to me and I am grateful.
I love you, Kat."
Kat put her arms around her uncle and held him tightly.
She had longed to hear such words.
"Christ is in you," he whispered to her.
Kat nodded.
Her uncle told her, "I don't think you realize how much God has used you to bless others.
You are held by Him.
Our lives intertwine.
God's will works for the good of all of those who love him, not just one or two.
Sometimes it involves hardship and things happen that we don't understand.
But when we look back on our lives and see those times, we understand that God has helped us through them even when we never would have guessed that at the time."
"Oh, Uncle Ken."
Kat wanted to tell him how much she would miss him, but she held her tongue, not wanting to speak of death, even though her uncle was saying his own good-bye.
Instead, she said, "I love you."
***** Thanksgiving morning, Ken passed away.
"I was just going to get him some water," Mary cried.
"He sent me for water, and when I came back with it, he'd passed over."
Adel, the woman from hospice, said, "People will often send loved ones out of the room.
It gives them permission to pass on."
Kat put her arm around her aunt and turned to Adel, "What do you mean, need permission?"
Adel nodded, "That's right.
People know when it is their time to die.
They try to hang on sometimes but only for those around them.
They're afraid to die because they know it hurts those who are left.
It's almost as if the dying person needs to receive your permission to die.
Asking Mary to get water was a way of doing that.
He couldn't die right in front of her.
It's not uncommon."
"So if someone who needs to die tells you to go, and you do, then that's okay?"
Kat asked, thinking of the night her mom passed away.
"Exactly, they know what they have to do but they don't want to hurt you so they tell you to go get something, or do something that gets you out of the room.
