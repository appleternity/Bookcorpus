That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable. '}];

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

"Send them a financial package and see if they are serious.
Tell Sally what you need and she will help you.
You might also ask Roger if any of our traditional lending sources might be interested.
He has developed a lot of good contacts."
August revenues and operating income came in above forecast.
It was only when Ken and Chris analyzed the underlying statistics that warning flags went off.
The ratios were different than the ratios generated for July.
A month-to-month comparison of expenses indicated large swings.
It didn't make sense.
Dagfin Jensen called Ken the following day.
After they exchanged pleasantries, Dag got to the point.
"How about a trip to Mexico next week?
I'm having a little trouble making any sense of the August numbers.
Are you having the same problem?"
"You read my mind, Dag.
Something is screwy.
Maybe Pedro and his accounting staff can make some sense of it?
I want Chris to come along too, just so we don't have a language problem."
After five days, Ken came back without making much progress.
Chris stayed behind to continue working on the problem.
"Dave, Dagfin is not happy.
He smells a rat.
Dag is talking about bringing in an audit team, but we convinced him to wait until the September results are in."
"That's not good, Ken.
Without Dag's support, it will be difficult to get the rest of the money for Phase I, much less anything for Phase II."
Let's hope September is a good month.
September revenues and profits were up.
More importantly, the ratios and expenses compared logically to August.
It appeared that July might have been an aberration caused by the grand opening and the short month.
Ken and Chris were reserving judgment until they analyzed the underlying statistics.
Two hours later Ken asked Bradford if they could meet to discuss the September results.
"How's 3:00, Ken?
Roger and I are in the middle of something."
Bradford later regretted not taking the time to talk with them immediately.
He would have been more prepared for Dag's call.
Dag called at 2:30.
"Dave, I wanted you to be the first to know.
We are putting an audit team together and will be in Cabo San Lucas Monday.
The audit should not take more than a week.
If everything turns out okay, we should still be able to meet your funding deadline."
Bradford tried to think quickly, but all he could say was; "I would like Ken and Chris to be there.
Agreed?"
"Agreed."
Ken and Chris came in soon after Dag's phone call and Bradford relayed the bad news.
"What do you think they will find?
Why is he demanding an audit?"
"Dave, we've been waiting for a chance to talk to you," Ken said.
"The daily occupancy numbers tell a bad story.
Remember when Dag, Chris and I went there a few weeks ago to see what we could find out?"
"Sure, you said you didn't find anything, didn't you?"
"That's right, we didn't, but we laid the groundwork.
Every day we went door-to-door counting occupied rooms.
We looked at their room telephone and room charges to see which rooms were occupied, and we came up with a daily occupancy number that is pretty darn accurate.
The problem is that these numbers are not close to the numbers Cabo is reporting.
For example, Wednesday we counted 206 occupied rooms.
The report says 112.
The same is true for the other days.
It looks like they are underreporting revenues."
"Someone must be skimming profits," Chris concluded.
"I assume Dag has the same information at his disposal?"
"He obviously knows what we counted but I don't know if he has all the detail.
However, the week we were there occupancy was approximately 78% and they reported occupancy for the month at 55%.
He knows that can't be right.
I am sure that's one of the reasons they requested the audit.
We were also suspicious of a few vendor expenses but couldn't be sure."
"Ken, I'd like you to email Dag the daily reports you just got, with a summary of your conclusions.
I don't want him to start distrusting us.
Stay here while I call Mario.
He won't be happy."
"Mario, Dave Bradford.
I have some bad news for you."
Mario was absolutely livid.
"Dave, we need $200M in two weeks or I lose the $40M deposit.
We have cut this too close.
What can we do?
Is there any money left over from the second funding of Phase I?"
"Sure there is, Mario, but I don't think that's the solution.
It would be too easy for Zurich for discover the transfer and default our contract.
We are talking to other lenders.
I'll get back to you."
"Okay, Dave, but I'm telling that this is important to me.
I can't afford to lose that deposit if you know what I mean."
Bradford heard Mario slam down the phone in obvious anger.
Mario was scared.
Bradford turned to Ken and Chris.
"Where do we stand on a backup lender by the way?
Are we set up to get funded if we need it?"
"Yes, but not in time for Mario," Chris answered.
"Both lenders are interested.
However, their funding is dependent upon obtaining appraisals and environmental reports.
It would take at least 45 days, probably 60 to actually get the money.
By the way, they both want a $25,000 deposit to get started."
Bradford beeped Roger and asked him to join them for a minute.
"Roger, do we have any sources that will lend Mario $80 Million within two weeks?
Mario needs to exercise his options on several land contracts or he will default a large sum of money.
I guess the collateral would be the contracts on the property he is purchasing."
"Well, Dave, until he gets title to the property it's not his, and it's worthless as collateral.
I don't know anyone that will give him a revolving credit line without land or some other hard asset to back it up.
His local bank is the only one who would lend him money based upon his personal guarantee."
"Is there a way we could borrow money on the assets of the other Phase I projects?
For example, how about borrowing against the leases on the Dominican Republic office development?"
"That's a possibility, Dave.
It's almost like doing an accounts receivable or inventory loan.
The problem is the assets are in the Dominican Republic and that will scare away almost any U.S. based lender."
"Ken, do we have any assets in Miami or Las Vegas that we can borrow against?"
"None that I know of," said Ken.
"The Miami project is still under development.
The Vegas hotel probably will appraise for a lot higher than cost, but not until it is finished and stabilized.
We are at least a year or two away from that.
By the way, I agree with you that using money that has been earmarked for these projects scares me.
It sounds like fraud and I for one, don't want to spend the next years looking over my shoulder when I take a shower."
"Okay, here's the plan for today.
Chris, you plan on spending the week in Cabo working with the audit team.
Let's get going with the other two lenders.
The stakes are pretty high so I am willing to fund the $25,000 application fees.
It will be nice to have a bargaining chip in our pocket when we negotiate with Zurich."
A crisis was brewing and Dave had a feeling things would get worse before they got better..
The Par 4, 375 yard 17th, was a sharp dogleg right.
They halved the hole with bogeys.
Dave's drive caught the last tree on the dogleg and forced him to pitch out into the fairway.
He missed the green with his third shot and was lucky to save bogey by sinking a nine footer that curled in at the last moment.
Buzz played the hole perfectly until he 3-putted from 20 feet, pushing his three foot par putt two inches right.
The beers had caught up to him.
Chapter 18 Par 5 - 555 Yards Problems - Meeting in Cabo San Lucas
This crisis could not have come at a worse time from Bradford's personal standpoint.
He had reached the semi finals of the Club Championship and if he won Saturday, he was in the finals.
The 36-hole final started the week the casino audit would be completed and Zurich would decide to fund the remainder of the project.
He told himself not to allow the golf tournament to influence business decisions, but it was difficult not to think about it.
He wanted so much to win the tournament.
Dave and Ken got in a practice round Friday morning, before his semi final match.
He shot 77 with two birdies.
The round could have been better if he had not missed several 8-foot putts.
Most golfers can say this after they complete a round.
Amateurs, or pros, seldom make them all.
Saturday Dave's semi-final opponent was Tom Osteen, a 2-handicap player that usually was a captain in the Friday game.
Tom had picked Bradford for his team a couple times, but the two men had never played together in the same foursome.
It was a tight semi match, with neither player able to take control.
Dave chipped in on 17 for birdie and was 1-up heading to the 18th, a Par 5 with water protecting the front of the green.
Both players hit good drives.
Dave hit first and played it safe, hitting a 5-iron in front of the water, about 120 yards from the hole.
Tom was 1-down in the match and felt he needed birdie to win the hole.
He decided to go for the green with a 3-wood and almost succeeded.
The ball cleared the water, but caught the bank and rolled back into the hazard.
Dave's pitching wedge stopped 10 feet from the hole and Tom conceded when his par-chip rolled 30' past the hole.
Bradford was in the finals
Chris left for Cabo San Lucas Sunday, where she would spend the week working with the Zurich audit team.
Dave and Ken were in the office Monday putting the finishing touches on an alternative financing plan just in case.
They were armed with a commitment from a California pension fund.
Interest rates were a couple points higher than the Zurich terms, but there was no equity participation.
The team's negotiating position had improved significantly in two years with one project complete, and three others started.
