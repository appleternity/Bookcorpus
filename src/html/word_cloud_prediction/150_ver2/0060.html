This frame also has a Recipient distinct from the Goal, as both can be present: 'I sent the manuscript to England to Bill.' 'I forwarded the grain to a dealer in Frankfurt.'  This frame contains verbs that participate in the ditransitive construction, with a recipient as the direct object, as in the following: 'I sent Bill the manuscript.' Certain Verbs in this Frame focus on the initial sending act, while others do not.  For example, I sent it rapidly can either mean the act of sending was initiated quickly or that it moved quickly.

Other words in this domain are based on the names of vehicles, and do not normally allow the Vehicle to be expressed as a separate constituent. 'The group biked all the way across the country.'

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

NB:  Contrast this frame with Likelihood and Preconditions frames, which involve many of the same lemmas.  Many LUs which might be expected to be found here (should, must, have to) are actually in the Required_event frame. Our analysis is that these LUs do not evoke an obligation directly, although they are frequently used in contexts that are consistent with an understanding of obligation and are pragmatically strengthened to (defeasibly) imply an obligation.

In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.' 'Unless you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.'

Transfer.'
Chapter 27 Giavani scooped another load of red dirt and spread it on the ground.
'Not so much of it, this time,' he said.
'I think we've emptied the pocket,' said Warner.
'Not a bad haul, though.' 'Do you think its a common element here on Mars?'
Warner shrugged.
'Hard to say.
It was pure chance we found this on our last visit.
I'd say Marilium here is like gold on Earth.' 'Maybe we can come back and find more one day.' 'How many fortunes can you spend in one lifetime?' 'You don't know my wife.'
Together they collected the Marilium and filled the fifth container.
'This should do it,' said Warner.
'Flooding the market would be counter productive, anyway.
You might as well add these to the collection.
I'll go and see Mitchum.'
Giavani picked up the containers, and took them to the Moonstruck, then he secured them to the hull with the others.
He stepped back and smiled.
One containers worth each.
Worth...millions.
Even his wife would struggle to spend it all.
* * * 'How's it going, Mike?' 'Good.
Just a couple more connections, then job done.
How about you?' 'Five containers filled.
Giavani's taken the last to the ship.
I think that's the last of it.' 'It was a useful little pocket.
I'm thinking of buying a little Pacific island where I can lie on the beach at night and stare at the stars, and thank God I'm not spending half my life in a stinking space suit.' 'You don't fool me, Mike Mitchum.
Out of all of us, you'll miss space travel the most.' 'Yeah.
Then I'll sip another Martini and get over it.
Grab hold of this pipe.'
Warner picked up one end of the Luxotral pipe and they carried it to Joe Hancock who was fitting a valve to the length of pipe in the new bore hole.
'Finished, Joe?' 'One more turn should do it.
There.
Now we just need to lower the pipes back in the water and the natural pressure should be enough to get a flow going.
Once the air is out of the system, we can close off the valve, make the final connection, open the valve again and bingo.' 'Okay.
Debbie.
When Joe gives the signal, you operate the crane and lower the pipes.'
Debbie stood by the crane, ready to lower the pipes.
Joe waved and she moved the slide control that lowered the crane head.
At a slow and steady rate, the pipes were lowered into the water reservoir and a fountain of acidic water spurted out of the top.
She kept lowering until Hancock waved to tell her it was at exactly the right height above the ground for the final pipe to be fitted.
Avoiding the water gushing out of the elbow with the new valve on the end, Hancock turned the valve off, stopping the flow.
Then he and Mitchum got the final pipe fitted in place.
'Now we can seal around the bore hole,' said Hancock.
Next to the bore hole was the sealer.
Roughly the size of a human, the pressurised container of fast setting sealer was ready to inject the expanding resin into the gap between the pipe and the bore hole.
This was to keep the pressure in the reservoir, to force the water along the pipes.
Mitchum and Hancock wheeled the sealer in position and Mitchum held the nozzle probe in place as Hancock turned the sealer on.
Hancock joined Mitchum to manoeuvre the nozzle all the way around the gap, fighting the back pressure.
They didn't stop until the sealer was empty.
Mitchum high five'd Hancock.
'Okay.
Gear away.
All done.'
All the equipment was stowed away in the borer.
Now, there was only one more thing to worry about.
Chapter 28 The Goliath settled in a huge crater, sending up a cloud of red dust.
Storme made his final inspection.
'Right, you scrunts.
You know why we are here.
We have the element of surprise on our side, plus superior fire-power.
I'm not expecting any resistance, but if we do, we'll deal with it.
We are travelling at night over unknown terrain.
Polaski.
You'll drive Battle Buggy One.
I'll be up front with you.
Use lights until the last twenty miles.
Slow right down at that point.
We do not want to be trying to dig the beast out of a ravine.
Got that, Polaski?' 'Yessir, Commander.' 'Pascalli.
You'll drive Battle Buggy Two.
Pratt.
You be his eyes when the lights go out.' 'Yessir.' 'Get strapped in.
And I don't mean tomorrow.
MOVE!'
The battle buggies were all pressure sealed units, sixteen wheels, laser cannons mounted fore and aft, capable of travelling at ninety miles per hour, carrying nine fully armed troopers plus the drivers.
Even being sealed, Storme made his men suit up.
The terrain was too treacherous to take chances with.
Storme got in his seat next to the driver.
He pressed the button on his radio.
'Tanner.
Open the door.'
The entire back of the Goliath opened up to the Martian night sky.
'Bye, bye, shit head,' said Tanner.
'Later, Tanner.
MOVE!'
The Battle Buggies rolled forwards, and there in front of them was the mighty Olympus Mons, the biggest mountain in the solar system.
Rolling steadily along at forty miles per hour, both Polaski and Storme looked out for natural hazards.
The buggies were tough and tested, but the Martian landscape was a mishmash of craters and ravines.
The many sandstorms could easily fill a ravine, making them undetectable until it was too late.
Only fools and men on a mission, like the uncompromising Commander Storme, would even contemplate driving two hundred miles at night.
And only men whipped into shape by a leader like Storme would be crazy enough to follow him.
Chapter 29 'I haven't seen your GenMoP lately,' said Mitchum.
'I think he's in the jungle somewhere.
I've a feeling the chimp in him is taking over.
That was one of the reasons we are here.
Just to see how would a GenMoP adapt to an environment like the base.'
Susan sipped her wine.
'If he becomes more like a chimp, it doesn't look like the experiment is too promising for using GenMoPs for space exploration.
That's quite a few million credits down the pan.' 'Hmm.
I can't say I'm looking forward to telling the brass, supposing there's a brass to tell anything to.' 'What will you do with him?' asked Giavani.
Foreman said, 'I think we have more serious and immediate problems to deal with before I need to worry about Monkley.
Have you managed to make any weapons?'
Mitchum said, 'I think we have everything in hand.
Not a bad meal, Andy.
Not too much seasoning this time.' 'Don't change the subject, Mike.
What have you got planned?' 'And spoil the surprise?' 'I don't like surprises.
What have you done?'
A black cloud of oppressive silence suddenly dominated the conversation.
'Okay.
Why don't I show you what we have planned?
Come with me.' 'Lead on.'
As Foreman was about to leave the room, Susan grabbed his arm.
'Andy...' 'What?'
There was a pause.
'Nothing.'
Foreman kissed her and followed Mitchum out of the kitchen.
'Andy,' said Mitchum.
'Before I show you what we've done, I'd like to show you something in the water treatment room.' 'Can't it wait?' 'Hey.
Humour me.
Me and my team have sweat blood sorting this mess out.
It'll only take a minute.' 'Whatever.'
Foreman followed Mitchum to the treatment room.
'So.
What am I looking at here?' 'This.'
Foreman turned to face the gun in his ribs.
'Mike?' 'Why the hell didn't you just die with the others, Foreman?' 'You?' 'Guilty.
For what it's worth, I feel bad about killing you.' 'You feel bad.
Imagine how I feel.' 'Why don't we step outside?
I'd hate to damage any of the plant.' 'How very noble of you.' 'Out.'
Foreman walked out the door, feeling the gun digging in his spine.
'Keep walking.'
Foreman went into the middle of the jungle.
'That's far enough.' 'Okay.
I've been living on borrowed time.
I see that now.
But I got a right to know why.'
Mitchum shrugged.
'Nothing personal.
Just business.
Actually, I like you.
I still have to kill you.' 'Thanks.
