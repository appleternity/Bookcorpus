There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).

There had been a lot of that today.
Aiden put his arm around Paul.
"I know.
It's hard.
Most of the other guys are crying, also."
Aiden turned Paul toward him.
"I'm proud of you," Aiden said.
"You know you did the right thing.
For you as well as for them.
No one can hurt them ever again."
Paul cried even more.
"Now each of them is a little kid again," Aiden said.
They dispatched fifty youthful corpses stacked together inside the showers where they had run to escape their deadly fates.
Each corpse was in a varied state of awakening as a zombie.
Now, they, too, were little kids once more with nothing to disturb their peacefulness.
As Aiden looked back, he saw their blood flowing across the floor from the shower room.
# The boys cleaned out the girl's gym.
The scene was the same.
Girls cut open by the sharp teeth and fingernails of their drooler friends were being fed upon by their girlfriends, lovers, and even by a few general strangers who had simply staggered blindly onto the campus that day.
As the football jocks clobbered their heads into the ground, Aiden and Ricky noticed that Billy Edwards had found his sister, Mary Anne, chewing on another girl.
He had not hesitated to re-kill her already damaged brain matter with his descending baseball bat.
Her brain had shattered like a watermelon which was becoming a very familiar sight.
Billy did not even pause.
He brought the bat down on the head of the girl that his sister had killed, silencing her forever as well, which was the right thing to do, saving her from the horror of becoming another zombie in the army of resuscitated and very dangerous walking dead.
Aiden and the other batters were clubbing half-naked girls all over the gymnasium.
Not one of them were aroused by the sight.
This was simply a clean up action.
Sex was the farthest thing from their minds.
There would be time for love between the sexes for young adults later, but only if their world were cleaned of the infection.
The dream of sleeping with a girl who later awakened to kill you was flashing like a You Tube Movie inside their minds as a distinct possibility.
It was one thing that they'd never allow to happen after this deadly day of mayhem and terror.
Mere survival amid the horror of the infection was the only goal they had.
Love was as far away as forever after.
It wasn't even considered.
That's how much their idealism had faded in the midst of their first need which was that of survival.
"We need to do another walk through the gym," Aiden said.
"Let's get this done.
Leave no one alive, guys."
A few clubs made their mark on those that had been forgotten on the first pass.
As each club smacked into a skull, the boy doing the batting yelled, "Clear!"
It was visceral and surreal.
Aiden would never forget this day.
The sight of beautiful girls lying dead, cut open and used as mere food for the walking dead confronted their systems.
Fluids oozed across their shirts and onto the floors.
Their once beautiful bodies had produced these final ghastly images that would haunt Aiden and all of the others forever.
Inside the showers, the clubbing went on with the yells of "Clear!
Clear!
Clear!"
as each crushed head was verified as completely shattered before the next one was approached and smashed.
"Clear."
"Clear."
"Clear."
# Aiden took all the high school kids who had not been bitten to the cafeteria next.
He had hoped he'd find more of the students alive, locked up in there, and waiting to be rescued.
If so, they'd be safe from the biters.
On the way, they killed a number of droolers, mostly little kids from the high school, people they grew up with.
They stooped over bodies of people they had murdered.
They were so busy eating teachers and high school freshmen on the bloodied floors that they just ignored Aiden and the others and continued chewing.
It seemed absurd that most of these high school zombies as well as the corpses they were eating had been friends just that morning.
The zombie kids were totally familiar with their victims, because they'd gone to school together for years.
In only a few hours all of that had changed.
Now, the recent past seemed like it had been a dream and that it had never really existed.
They were just waking up.
Now, everything they had been taught about human goodness was a big fucking lie like all the others in their lives.
"I wish I were never born right now," Aiden said.
"Me, too," Ralph Abrams confessed.
"This is just pure bull shit."
"I want my mom," Jennifer Kramer said.
"I want to go home right now."
"It's not going to happen," Aiden said, "unless you want to walk there all alone."
"That's crazy!
I'd never make it."
"Smart girl, Jennifer.
You stick with us.
There's power in numbers.
Otherwise, there's not a chance of a snowball in Lancaster that you'll still be alive tomorrow morning."
Jennifer's eyes became watery.
"This is sickening," Jennifer said.
"It's like a horror movie."
"And we are all seconds," Aiden said.
"We're underpaid and unwanted."
It was melodramatic, but it was honest.
"That's for sure, Jennie said.
"We only have meaning to ourselves if we can stay healthy and avoid becoming infected," Aiden explained.
"We only do that if we stick together.
Even so, many of us are going to die tonight.
There's nothing we can do about it, but try our best to stay clean.
Hopefully, we can all make it.
But we have to live smart all of the time from now on.
The way we used to be is dead now."
"The school was not smart," Ralph said.
"That's for sure.
They should have protected us."
"Well, they didn't know it was coming," Aiden reasoned.
"It took them unaware.
Not long ago everything was normal.
Now, look at it.
Normal is half the town dead and many of them are right now resurrecting to hunt us down and kill the rest of us."
"It's crazy," Ralph said.
"Of course, it's crazy.
Zombies were always going to be crazier than bat shit if they existed at all.
Well, now they do.
Of course, they are crazy.
That's what they are."
"That's so true," said Bob Ravens.
Bob was a football tackle.
Jennifer leaned against Bob.
His body was strong, and it should have made her feel safe, but it didn't.
Not any more.
She'd never feel safe again, not as long as she lived.
"I'm going to be sick," she said.
"Did they bite you?
Tell me they didn't bite you," Bob Ravens said.
"I'm not bit," she said.
"Here.
Check me over.
I'm clean."
Bob looked at every exposed inch of her body and then some.
"He's getting himself horny for free," Ralph said.
"What a lech, Ravens.
I bet you fuck cows at midnight."
"Actually, I fuck cows in the morning when I milk them.
My fingers on their udders makes them love me."
"You damn farm boys."
"Luck of the draw," Bob said.
"We were just born in the country to become the lucky boys.
We got lots more things to do than you town folks ever dreamed of in those dirty little brains of yours."
"How's that?"
"We was nasty even before Internet porno.
In fact, we filmed it in the stalls."
"I bet you did."
"They don't say farm boys have more fun for nothing," Bob joked.
He grinned.
He chuckled under his breath.
He loved bullshitting the city kids.
They were always total suckers for his fantastic lies.
"He doesn't fuck cows, Ralph.
He's just shooting you a big crap load.
Don't let him rile you."
"Maybe I like being riled," Ralph said.
"Yea.
Maybe I love it."
"It's better than what happened in Lancaster today," Aiden said.
"I was all ready for the big game this weekend.
Now, that's not important.
It's not even a part of the horizon anymore."
"Why not?"
Ralph asked.
"Because there is no horizon," Aiden said.
"Football games are over forever.
