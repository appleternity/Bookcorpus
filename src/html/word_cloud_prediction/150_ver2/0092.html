To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

"So what is the next step in the process?"
Monica asked, again showing less enthusiasm than Lydia had hoped.
Monica looked carefully at the documents put before her.
Lydia described the non-disclosure agreement and the various details of the sample writing assignment.
"What are you looking for in this sample writing piece?"
Monica asked.
"This is mostly used to assess your writing style, but we also use it to get ideas for possible book topics."
"Okay," nodded Monica, "I can get that to you in a few days."
She put the paper in her purse and collected her things to go.
"Thank you very much for your time."
The two women shook hands again and Monica headed for the door.
Noticing their imminent departure, the waiter came over to the table with the bill.
"How was everything?"
he asked, repeating the same eye-catching smile Lydia remembered from earlier.
"It was great," she said, responding with her own best smile.
In truth, the pastries weren't as sweet as she had hoped, and the coffee was far too bitter, but she couldn't look into his rich brown eyes and say that.
His smile seemed genuine enough that she gave him a big tip anyway.
She took a little longer than usual putting the credit card back into her purse, just in case he would say anything to her, but he just walked back into the kitchen.
Stepping out of the cafe, Lydia looked at her watch.
With the traffic at this time of day, she would get back to the office just before five.
On a normal week this would be a good reason to go straight home instead, but this was not a normal week.
She had a backlog of tasks still from earlier in the week, as well as a few more names of people to call again about interviews.
It would be nice to get a few more candidates, but so far none had confirmed and there was only a week until she would need their sample articles.
It wouldn't be the first time she had a Friday night supper at the office.
Maybe the pizza delivery boy would remember her.
During the Feminine-ism project busy times, she saw him at least once a week.
He didn't have the same pretty boy smile as the waiter at the cafe, but the regularity of his visits almost qualified as a relationship.
Chapter 9 - Religious Women
The last few days until Lydia's big meeting passed by quickly.
All four of the author candidates submitted their sample articles in plenty of time, and none of the other people she called expressed any interest.
She wanted to run a few things by Oscar one more time before Gerald and the Board of Directors grilled her.
Of course she had done thorough market research and knew her author candidates and their pieces of writing inside and out, but she wanted to be absolutely certain that she wouldn't be asked a question that she wasn't ready to answer.
Oscar's opinions weren't universal and his experience was often a little jaded, but his first-hand account was more interesting and probably more reliable than looking at charts and reading technical market analyses.
Oscar had agreed to meet Lydia in the afternoon on the Saturday before her meeting.
Earlier that morning he had taken a bus over to Evangeline's home.
The two of them needed to talk about wedding details because Evangeline and her mother had made some arrangements and they were hoping to be able to finally set a date for the wedding.
After a few hours of discussion, though, they were no closer to confirming that date and Evangeline needed to leave for choir practice.
Together they had agreed that Evangeline would drop him off for his lunch meeting with Lydia and then pick him up on her way back.
"I thought we had agreed that we would pick a date this morning," Evangeline said after a long time of silence in the car.
"Yes, we did agree to that, but I wanted to run the new dates that you were suggesting past my parents, and they weren't answering the phone, so there's nothing I could do."
"It's our wedding, Oscar.
Your parents would make it work no matter what date we pick."
"Of course they would, but it's only fair that if your parents get to be part of the discussion, then so do mine.
Besides, as soon as my folks see that I've called, they'll call me back and we can let them know what days we're thinking of, and then boom, we'll have a wedding date.
I don't know why this is such a big deal."
"This is going to be our anniversary for the rest of our lives, Oscar, it's a very big deal.
I really wanted to have a wedding date picked by now, and we could have if you hadn't been so stubborn."
"Okay, fine!"
said Oscar.
"Open your little wedding planning book.
We can forget about the dates your parents suggested and we'll just tell my parents about it afterwards.
Let's pick a date, no parents, just you and me."
"That's ridiculous Oscar.
My dad is officiating the wedding, he has to know which date works ahead of time."
"It's our wedding, Evangeline.
He'll make it work."
"You're being immature," she said, shaking her head.
"Let's just talk about something else.
How are your meetings with Lydia going?"
"Good, I guess," Oscar said carefully, trying to gauge whether she wanted an answer or if she was just trying to change the subject.
"It's been really interesting hearing her thoughts on the Christian world from an outside perspective."
"Do you think she's coming along?"
asked Evangeline.
"You know, spiritually?"
"I don't know.
I guess we haven't really talked much about her spirituality.
It's been mostly business."
"But you are trying to tell her the gospel, right?"
"So far she's been asking some really good questions about why some Christians do one thing and others do the opposite thing.
I haven't had a chance to explain the gospel to her because I've been so busy explaining to her why the gospel is so poorly applied.
Besides, it doesn't necessarily mean anything that I'm telling her about Christianity.
She's telling me about the publishing process too, that doesn't mean I'm going to ask her how I can become an author."
Evangeline looked up from her wedding planning book, "If you want some help with evangelism ideas, you should talk to my dad."
"I'll see if I can fit it into his busy schedule," Oscar said as they pulled up to the agreed upon restaurant.
Evangeline rolled her eyes but decided instead to change the subject when she saw Lydia standing outside the door of the restaurant.
"Do you enjoy talking to Lydia?"
she asked.
Oscar replied immediately by casually saying, "I guess."
He certainly had enjoyed working together with Lydia on the project so far, but he also knew that Evangeline was secretly asking if he thought Lydia was pretty.
He remembered thinking she was pretty in high school, and he thought she was even prettier now.
He hoped his quick answer had allayed any of Evangeline's fears, but just in case, he also added, "She has an entirely different outlook on the world from me, so there are definitely limits to how deep the conversation can go.
It's tough to look past that."
"Okay," Evangeline said as Oscar opened the door to leave.
She looked up and noticed that Lydia had spotted them.
Before Oscar stepped out of the car, Evangeline said, "Aren't you going to give me a goodbye kiss?"
He turned back to her, leaned in and gave her the kiss she was waiting for.
"Have fun with the wedding shopping today.
Don't spend too much money," he said as he stepped out of the car.
Oscar walked nonchalantly toward Lydia, and after they had greeted each other, he turned back and waved goodbye to Evangeline, who hadn't left yet.
Inside the restaurant Oscar and Lydia stood quietly at the counter while they thought about what they wanted to eat.
When their meals were ready they quickly found a table.
Oscar asked to find one close to a window so he could watch for Evangeline's return.
"How are you feeling in the lead-up to your big meeting with the Board?"
he asked.
"I have all my materials ready," she said, getting a folder out of her bag and sliding it across the table to him.
"It would be nice to have interviewed a few more candidates, but these were the only credible-sounding ones that responded quickly enough.
At this point, I'm just trying to sell myself on one of the candidates so that I'll be able to make a convincing pitch to the Board."
"Just so you know," he said, starting to flip through its contents, "this is already the coolest project I've ever worked on.
Did you want me to read the material now?"
"There's no rush.
You can tell me later what you think.
I just wanted you to have a copy of it."
"I'm looking forward to reading this one of Alistair Graham," Oscar continued as he saw his profile in the folder, "Bethpage is pretty popular in Christian circles around here.
My fiancee and I were talking about going there.
She thinks it would be a fun weekend date some time."
"That doesn't sound like a very romantic outing to me," Lydia said, thinking back to her discomfort with the expectations of the retreat center.
Oscar just chuckled to himself.
"You don't know Evangeline."
"Okay, well, just so you know, they won't let you sleep in the same room."
"That's fine, neither will Evangeline."
Lydia's face couldn't hide her confusion, but Oscar decided he would rather discuss the book project than try to justify his relatively prudish relationship standards.
"So which candidate do you think you'll advocate for?"
"Right now I'm leaning toward Monica Lang, the social worker I mentioned.
I don't know if you got this sense from Benjamin Worsley, but I found the other three were all older guys that just came off sounding creepy, lonely or both.
Monica is younger than all of them and her material sounded both relevant and attainable."
Oscar looked up from his papers.
"You're not worried that the Board will think you're biased because she's a woman?"
"They probably will, and maybe I am a little biased, but if I can show them using their own criteria why she's a more qualified candidate, it shouldn't matter."
"Right," said Oscar, continuing to flip through the information.
"Did you have other plans when I met with her?"
Lydia asked.
"You never wrote back when I asked if you wanted to meet up with her."
"I was avoiding the issue," Oscar said meekly.
"About a year ago, Evangeline and I were looking for ideas of things we could to do together as a kind of charity date night.
I suggested helping out at Vashti's Palace for a few evenings.
When she called there to ask when we could come volunteer, they told her that she could go, but I, as a man, was not welcome.
Evangeline was more upset about it than I was, and we ended up going somewhere else."
"That kind of makes sense for a women's shelter, doesn't it?"
Lydia asked.
She wondered if Oscar could have been more sensitive, but she also couldn't help but think that none of her boyfriends would have ever been interested in a charity date night.
"Yes, it does," he conceded.
"I didn't see it immediately, but I totally understand how that wouldn't be the best place for me as a guy to hang out.
It definitely wouldn't be the best place for us to have a romantic moment either.
Anyway, I figured if she invited you to have the interview at the shelter, then I wouldn't be welcome.
Plus, from what Evangeline relayed to me about how that phone conversation went back then, I get the sense that she has some opinions that she might be more comfortable sharing if there weren't any men around.
I should have spelled that out earlier, but I didn't want to taint your impression of her, one way or the other."
"I guess I see where you're coming from," Lydia agreed.
"She did seem to be carrying a lot of resent toward men in general, but mostly toward her dead husband and the male leadership of the church she attended."
"Probably with good reason," Oscar added.
"It sounded like it," Lydia said.
Then, after thinking for a moment she added, "Most of my friends in university were feminists, and in those circles religion was almost a four-letter word.
What is it about Christianity that makes men want to take power away from women?"
Oscar let out a laugh before catching himself.
"I'm sorry, that is a very serious issue, and I don't mean to make light of it.
If you heard the argument I had in the car on the way here, though, you wouldn't think that the woman was the powerless one in our Christian relationship."
"Trouble in paradise?"
Lydia asked.
"It's just the stress of all this wedding planning," he shrugged.
"But as far as churches go, women often do have a lot of power.
In many less conservative churches, leadership positions are open to men and women.
