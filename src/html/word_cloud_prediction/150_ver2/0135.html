In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items.

The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

Airk explained that his family had been there since before the establishment of the shire some five generations earlier.
Airk's ancestor had served under Tomkin's ancestor in the campaign that had taken the land from the strange, twisted creatures that had once lived there.
Since then Airk's family had been yeomen, farmers who owned their small holding.
They paid taxes to the laird in the form of a set number of bushels of wheat every year.
This made them much wealthier than most of the village families, who only rented their land and who, no matter how much they paid in coin or crop, seemed to go farther into debt to their laird every year.
Tomkin and Airk discussed the arrangement at length, which seemed odd since Tomkin well knew the terms under which people in his shire lived.
It did give Jain a better understanding of just how well her parents had done for her in arranging the marriage.
Daniel had inherited his father's debt and Daniel's sons would inherit his.
They could not leave the land without permission because the debt, grown with every bad harvest, bound them to the laird.
This endless cycle of poverty meant that they were tied to whatever plots Tomkin gave them.
The peasant plots were always big enough to barely support a family.
Paying even part of the rent meant that the peasants had to scrape to get by and could never get ahead.
Airk was free of that.
His descendants would be, too.
"You and you," Tomkin said, pointing to Joan and then Eliza.
"Go home and ..."
He gestured vaguely.
"Farm or something.
You."
He pointed to Jain.
"Stay."
Joan gave Jain a worried look, but she and Eliza departed.
Tomkin stood and paced around the room.
"Tell me, Master Airk, how do you plan to pay your taxes this year?"
Airk leaned back in his chair and blew out a long sigh.
"I have no idea, my lord.
The crops were ruined by the fire and it is too late in the season for another harvest.
My parents did leave me some money."
Tomkin clucked his tongue.
"The arrangement is for wheat by the bushel.
I've no interest in your money."
"I understand, my lord."
Airk rubbed his forehead as he thought.
"We do have some livestock."
"No.
My castle's pens are filled to bursting."
Tomkin stopped at the side of the table nearest to where Jain stood.
The laird placed his hands on the table and leaned forward so that he was almost face to face with Airk.
"It would appear that you are in default."
Airk opened his mouth to speak, but no sound came out.
The muscles of his face clenched as if he suffered some great pain.
Jain would have not have faulted him for openly weeping then.
But Airk composed himself.
"Can there be no arrangement, my lord?"
"Perhaps," Tomkin said, pushing off the table.
"You are the last of the yeoman in this shire.
I suppose that might be worth preserving."
He turned to Jain and leered.
"I could collect what is mine next year, if you give me something for my trouble."
He took a step toward Jain.
"My lord," Airk said as he stood up.
Both of Tomkin's men drew their swords and pointed them at Airk.
"She is not mine to give," Airk explained desperately.
"Our wedding is not for some months."
Tomkin smirked.
"Then you are not of much use to me, are you, peasant?"
He reached out and fondled Jain's breasts.
Like all peasant women Jain had been taught not to resists the advances of a laird.
He owned the land and everything on it and to resist his will was to be executed.
Better to allow herself to be ravaged, even to risk birthing a bastard, than to risk her own torture and death.
But Jain had killed a man the day before, killed him while her brothers stared in shock.
Her nerves had not really recovered and she acted without thinking.
She struck Tomkin.
It was no slap, but a close-fisted blow that connected solidly with the laird's nose.
He took a step back as blood poured down the front of his shirt.
"Hrnns!"
he gurgled in a failed effort to say, "Guards!"
Both guards turned and Airk took the opportunity to flip the table.
It landed on the foot of one of the guards.
The other guard looked back at his fellow.
Jain took the opportunity to kick the laird in the crook between his legs.
As he crumpled, she grabbed the sword in his belt.
The guard who did not have his foot trapped under a table advanced on Jain and swung his sword.
Jain tried to block, but Tomkin's sword was heavy and it flew out of her hand when the guard's blade hit it.
Jain tried to back away and hit the wall.
Airk grabbed a cooking pot from beside the fire and flung it.
The clang of metal on metal filled the cottage as the pot dented the guard's helmet.
Jain stepped sidewise and picked up the laird's fallen sword in a two handed grip.
She swung with the intent of decapitating the guard.
About halfway through the swing she stumbled and the blade went high and connected with the guard's helmet.
The flat of the blade and not the edge connected.
The guard, still reeling from the first hit, fell into a seated position.
His sword slipped from his grasp and he made no move to pick it up.
The other guard managed to get his foot out from under the table.
He took a step, howled in pain, and collapsed.
Airk took his sword.
"What do we do?"
Jain stood, shaking.
What could they do?
She had assaulted a laird and Airk had helped her.
If they were lucky they would hang.
More likely they would be tortured to death by the augura or perhaps by Tomkin's personal augur.
"We have to get away," she finally said.
"Far away."
"Alright," Airk said lamely.
"Where do we go?"
"Anywhere!"
Jain shouted suddenly.
She took a few deep breaths.
"We need to tie them up.
Give us time to get away."
"Right," Airk said.
He undid the sword belt of the guard with the broken foot and used it to bind the guard's arms.
Then he did the same with the other guard, who was too dazed to resist.
Tomkin had somewhat recovered, but with only his dagger and confronted by two swords he could do nothing but let them do what they would.
Jain untied his sword belt and fastened it to her own waist.
"Never forget," she told him as Airk trussed Tomkin up with a bit of rope.
"Never forget that it was peasant girl who beat you."
She leaned in and whispered.
"Shamed you."
And then she spat on him.
"We can't take that sword," Airk said.
"Someone would recognize it."
Jain looked at the sword.
Its hilt was worked with jewels and the pommel shaped into a stylized lion's head.
She pushed the tip of the blade into a crack between the floorboards.
Airk gave her a questioning look, but then helped her push it in further until the blade stood up on its own.
Jain leaned on the hilt so that the blade bent.
"No!"
Tomkin cried.
And the blade snapped.
The dagger was of a similar, quite recognizable make.
Jain tossed it into the fireplace and took the remaining guard's sword.
It was heavy in the scabbard and interfered with her balance, but she would get used to it.
Airk quickly grabbed a change of clothes, some food, and his family's money box, cleverly hidden behind one of the blankets on the wall.
Jain at first thought to take some of Airk's sister's clothes but she thought better of it and took Eli's clothes instead.
If she was going to be an outlaw she would have to wear something more practical than skirts.
They helped themselves to the guards' horses; the laird's was too distinctive, and they rode off toward the wilds.
They agreed that they could not risk the main road.
Airk knew of a deer track that would get them well away before Tomkin and his men could get themselves free.
The track was a secret way used by peasants and outlaws trying to avoid the authorities.
That was why they were both surprised when they overtook another rider.
Chapter 3 "Eduard?"
Jain asked as they approached.
Eduard had drawn his sword and wheeled his mount when he heard them.
He had a hunted look in his eye.
"What are you two doing here?"
Jain opened her mouth, a lie already forming in her mind, when Airk said, "The same thing you are, I'd wager."
Eduard tilted his head, curious, but not quite trusting.
"What did you do?"
Airk nodded in Jain's direction.
"She gave our laird some trouble."
"Oh," Eduard lowered his sword as his gaze fixed on Jain.
"What sort of trouble?"
"He tried to touch me," she said, her stomach queasy at the thought.
"I punched him."
"Then she kicked him in the stones," Airk added.
"Hah!"
Eduard said.
"Brilliant."
