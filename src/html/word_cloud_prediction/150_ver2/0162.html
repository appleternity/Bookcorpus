The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

She gave me a playful punch on my upper arm.
"Was it a nightmare?"
I looked out the kitchen window and said, "No.
Not really.
I have it every so often.
My brothers and father are fishing along a beautiful stream, and I try and catch up to them, but I never get there in time."
She took my hand and asked, "Is that hard for you after all this time?"
"No.
It's very frustrating, though, but I'll catch up to them one day," I answered gazing into her expressive eyes bracketed with crinkles that sometimes take my breath away.
Trina honked, and I walked Monica to the porch.
"Why don't you take a nice nap, and when I get home I'll have some new under clothes and socks for you," she said as she kissed my cheek.
I waved to Trina and she blew me a kiss.
After my nap, I walked up University, and waved to the Greek barber who was talking to the veterinarian.
I turned on Roberts Road toward North Santa Cruz Avenue.
I passed Falaschi's Bar and knocked on the window at the bartender, Nello, who was busy doing a crossword puzzle, or so he'd tell people.
He was really looking at the racing form so he could bet on the horses.
We used to frequent that place, Falaschi's.
At times it could be a real family place.
Most of the time, though, it was a workingman's bar.
When Connie and Desi were younger, Nello would play the jukebox and ask my little ones to dance, and he'd give each of them a fifty-cent piece.
They would shimmy and shake and we'd all clap.
The kids would take their newly earned money and head for Eddie's Northside Market and load up on candy bars.
My tooth started to ache as I passed the site of the Cottage Grove Cannery, which was now a shopping center.
God damn it, I don't want to go to the dentist, shit.
I crossed Saratoga Avenue and heard a whistle.
I looked up and saw Lou, the guy that owned the Shell Station wave and say, "Hola, muchacho!"
I always stopped at the site of the cannery camp and tried to place where things were when I lived there.
European-style buildings now set where the cottages once were.
I started to feel a tingle in my arm.
"This is familiar," I said, remembering my heart attack at Carlos' rancho years ago.
But I kept walking, denying the symptoms.
There was a roaring in my ears and I saw spots.
Chapter 61
Mickey Los Gatos 1971
I was getting worried because Pop hadn't shown up at the store.
Did I forget?
Did he tell me he wasn't coming today?
It's not like him to not call.
An ambulance, siren wailing racing down Santa Cruz, headed north, and I felt a sense of dread.
I stepped onto the sidewalk just as the ambulance stopped at the corner of Santa Cruz and Royce Street.
I headed down to the scene.
As I got closer, I saw an attendant put an oxygen mask on Pop.
"Does anyone know this man," the ambulance attendant asked.
"He's my father," I said between my gasps and stifled sobs.
Pop's eyes were closed and he looked peaceful.
A man who saw him fall said, "Yeah, just before he hit the ground he said something about going fishing.
Or something like that."
Chapter 62
Trina Los Gatos 1971
I'd made my third pass by the terminal looking for Desi.
He's supposed to be by the baggage area.
Where is he?
I finally spotted him by the large glass doors, and I maneuvered my car to the curb, all the while ignoring the honks from others.
I rushed out of the car and met Desi on the sidewalk.
"Oh, God, I'm glad you could get leave, Baby," I said as we hugged.
A taxi driver yelled out the window to us.
"Get a room, fer cryin'out loud!"
I felt Desi bristle and step to the cab.
I grabbed his arm and said, "Let it go."
We headed up Highway 17 toward Los Gatos.
"How's Mama, Trina?"
I shook my head and answered, "Not good, Baby.
The doctor gave her some pills to calm her down.
They aren't working too good."
I started to sniffle.
"Papa is as handsome as ever, dressed in his Sunday suit--Oh, God!
I promised I was going to hold it together."
He took my hand and squeezed it, then brought it to his cheek, and I felt the wetness of his tears.
"How are you doing?
Mama told me about your troubles with Orrin," he said.
"Maybe this ain't the time to talk about it."
"It's okay.
He was a real rata and I'm better off without him in my life."
"What about his girls?"
Desi asked.
"That was the tough part.
On one hand I feel bad because they're in foster homes.
That bitch in Stockton wants nothing to do with them.
Her and Orrin are probably going to divorce and our marriage was annulled.
Thank you, Jesus," I murmured as I made the sign of the cross.
"The girls never knew their mother committed suicide after she found out about Mrs. Tight-ass in Stockton.
They thought that she died of cancer."
"Man oh, man he was bad to the bone," Desi said.
"I had the option of taking the girls in, and that's where the hard part comes up.
I have enough trouble making ends meet, and I can't count on him for support dinero while he's in jail.
Even if he could pay, he probably wouldn't."
"In my opinion they didn't seem to jibe with you, Trina, always lipping off with the sass talk and what not."
"That's what keeps me from feeling too bad.
I know it's not their fault, but they were users in training.
They'll end up just like their father, and God damn it, they aren't my responsibility," I said when I took the off-ramp into town.
"Baby, everybody is at Place's Funeral Parlor.
Do you need to go home first?"
Desi shook his head, and stared at the floorboard.
"Jesus, I don't want to do this."
The brick steps up to the front door of the funeral home seemed as tall as a skyscraper.
People were milling around on the porch, some in conversation and others smoking.
A hush spread across the veranda as Desi and I approached.
The voices became more solemn and dropped to a barely-audible whisper as we entered the mortuary.
Carlos and Mickey were standing on either side of Connie at Pop's coffin.
Desi and I moved in and we all held each other.
I could hear Mama sob and I looked over to her just as Chela and Linda were embracing her.
"The Lord will make good use of him, that's for sure.
Fruit trees need trimming and lawns tended to," Desi said as he made his way to the kneeler, weeping openly.
I heard Mama wail, "My baby!"
as she knelt next to him.
Chapter 63
Mickey Los Gatos 1971
The next night at the rosary, I sat with my family holding my rosary beads, the same ones I pulled out of my suit pocket so long ago, the night of the Sleepy Lagoon murder.
I listened to the Hail Marys and reflected back on the promise I made to myself on the bus ride Pop and I took out of Los Angeles, a promise I didn't seem to have completely fulfilled.
I'll be as good a son as he is a father.
It's never too late; my family is the most important thing in my life...
Tears flowed heavily, and Linda held my hand tighter while Carlos pulled my shoulder closer, which opened the floodgates even more.
We were a crying family and I was no exception to the rule.
I sensed Rosie looking at me and heard her say to Linda, "I've never seen Papa like this before.
I'm scared."
She stood up and knelt in front of me and laid her head on my lap.
I patted her head and lifted her chin and smiled through my tears and said, "I love you, Baby."
I heard my mother say, "Will you take a look at that, Husband."
After the rosary, people mingled around the casket reflecting on Pop's life and his goodness, his loyalty, and his work ethic.
I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned and saw Carol Fanning standing in front of me.
"Your father was a good man, Mickey.
I was very fond of him and I'll miss him."
"Thank you, Mrs. Fanning, for more things than you know.
You gave us a start in this town and Pop was always grateful for your kindness."
She held up her hand and said, "All I did was give him a boost; you and he did the rest."
She briefly looked down at Pop, and then said with a curl of her lip, "I remember the time he wanted to borrow money from the bank, and got turned down.
He got into Hamsher's face and told him they needed Mexicans on the board of directors.
It wasn't too many years later that you were appointed to that board.
Talk about giving back; you do that, Mickey, and your father was very proud of you."
The next day at the funeral at St. Mary's Church, as my family walked slowly down the center aisle behind the coffin, I saw Jimmy Thomas out of the corner of my eye, sitting across the aisle in one of the front pews.
When Carlos saw Jimmy, he stepped out of line and walked over to him and they embraced.
Carlos sobbed on his best friend's shoulder.
Trina followed suit.
The procession behind the casket clogged for several seconds and Mama yelled in a loud voice to the undertaker who was leading the pallbearers, "Alto!"
with her hand out like a traffic cop and pointed to the slowdown with a stern look.
When Trina and Carlos re-joined us, Jimmy was with them and Mama nodded, and then motioned to the undertaker to continue.
Connie, Desi and I exchanged brief grins between our tears.
Pop was laid to rest under the huge deodar tree in Los Gatos Cemetery, just a few blocks from my house.
Those at the service were invited to a get together at "We and Our Neighbors Club" hall on the corner of Los Gatos-Almaden and Union Avenue.
The food laid out was a grand fiesta--all of Pop's favorites: enchilada, tamale, and rice and beans.
Also available was fried chicken and several types of salad.
Beer, wine and punch satisfied thirsts.
Someone had several bottles of tequila stashed on a bookshelf next to a stone fireplace that became an oasis for some.
Rosie rushed up to me and said, "Oh, Papa, I'm so sad.
I'm going to miss Bampa something awful."
I hugged her and told her I was, too.
"But think how much you would have missed if you didn't know Bampa.
I feel sorry for the people that didn't know Ramon Reyes."
"I do too, Papa.
You always make me feel better.
