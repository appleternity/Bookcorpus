In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

"I thought going off to college would straighten you out.
Give you time to sow your oats, but it hasn't," Wade explained.
"The way I live my life shouldn't be an issue.
We made a deal.
The land was mine when I finished college.
I finished, and you're trying to back out because you think I need a wife.
I'm not you, Granddad.
I don't need or want a wife."
"That shows me how little you know about this place!"
Wade shouted, unable to control his temper.
"We are tied to the land.
We've worked hard to be strong leaders and good standing members of this community!"
"And I need a wife for that?"
McCrea questioned.
Three taps on the study door interrupted, causing heads to turn and paused the heated conversation.
"It's open," Hardin answered.
When the driver of the Chevy eased her head in, McCrea stopped her at the door.
"What do you want, Eleanor?"
The sharpness of his tone caused her to snap back.
"Excuse me, grouch.
I'm looking for Louisa.
Have you seen her?"
"I'm not my sister's keeper," he grumbled, not knowing why he was directing his anger at her.
"I have no idea where Lou is."
"Belle took her into town," Hardin answered with the same patient tone he used for his daughter.
She huffed out, "Darn" before shoving her hands into her back pockets.
"Something we can help you with?"
Hardin ask, and checked his watch.
"No, I'll come back."
"Hang around.
They should be back soon."
McCrea held the door open for her.
"Could you hang around in the hall?
We're in the middle of something."
Even as he tried to usher her out of the room, he couldn't help but notice how well her newly acquired curves filled every inch of her faded hip huggers.
Eleanor Mackenna wasn't strikingly beautiful.
Her creamy skin wasn't covered by layers of makeup, and her hair wasn't curled into the latest fashion.
In fact, she was pretty plain and seldom made an effort to make herself anything other than that.
But damn, if it didn't work for her.
"Oh, sorry."
A dusting of red colored her cheeks as she backed out the door.
"I didn't mean to interrupt.
Mr.
C, do you care if I get something from Louisa's room?
I left one of my dresses up there, and I have a date tonight."
McCrea had known Eleanor most of her life, and at first, she had been the shy little neighbor who blushed when he spoke to her.
But she was too energetic for shyness, and it hadn't taken her long to become a member of his family.
There wasn't a single activity, celebration or holiday she wasn't involved in.
She was a sweet girl with a magnetic appeal which made her approachable and attractive in an indescribable way.
She was kind, funny, and quirky, and McCrea felt his agitation start to soften.
"Is it with the tuba player who took you to the prom?"
The blush on her cheeks darkened.
"Conner didn't play the tuba.
He played the saxophone and no.
He's not my date."
She stuck her tongue out and crossed her arms over her chest like a pouting child.
He wasn't a dumbass.
He knew Eleanor had been hot on his heels for years, but he always ignored her, something easy to do until a few months ago.
Up until then, she was just a chatty, somewhat annoying little girl with the coordination of a newborn colt and the elegance of an ostrich.
That wasn't the case anymore.
Now she was a full-fledged, curvy, blonde who turned heads and extracted whistles and cat-calls.
In the past, he had been guilty of tempting her, but now the knobby-kneed little girl he'd left in the fall was the one tempting him.
"Get what you need," Hardin said, ignoring their bickering.
She began backing out of the door.
"Thanks."
"How's Rose doing?"
Wade asked, purposefully keeping her in the room.
Holy hell, McCrea swore silently.
Would they ever get back to the land?
With a heavy breath, he sat down in the chair across from the desk.
His impatience earned him a searing glance from Eleanor.
She was adorable when she was angry.
In an angry pup kind of way.
"A little sad I'm leaving, but other than that, she's fine."
"Her sadness is understandable.
You're a real comfort to her.
Lou mentioned you earned a scholarship."
Her head bobbed up and down.
"That's right.
I worked my butt off for it."
"What are you studying?"
"Business."
"Can't go wrong there."
"Maybe you should help Lou decide on a major," Hardin suggested.
She lifted a shoulder.
"Louisa is smart, Mr. C.
She'll figure it out."
"Are you coming back here after college?"
Wade continued his questions.
"Definitely."
She took a few steps forwards, allowing McCrea another lengthy glance at her backside.
"I'm going to rebuild Redemption."
McCrea didn't have to see her eyes to know they shone with pride.
Rebuilding her granddad's ranch was her dream.
She worked tirelessly around the place, and had since she came to live with Rose years ago.
When she was old enough, she got a job at Lomer's Hardware stocking shelves after school, and Old Ed Tubs let her wait tables at his bar and clean up on weekends.
The money she earned wasn't spent on frivolous things like makeup and new clothes.
Her worn, faded denims were proof of that.
She had spent her last year of high school saving for a second-hand car he nicknamed Old Blue.
The Toyota Corolla came with a busted radiator and over a hundred thousand miles.
It stayed in the shop more than it stayed on the road and was an eyesore with a duct tape bumper and missing hubcaps.
"I'm glad to hear that."
Wade was pleased by her plan.
"Those are awfully big dreams for a little girl like yourself," McCrea jeered.
"No bigger than finding gold in the ruins of an old church or landing that twelve-point buck you're always talking about."
He grinned at her comeback.
"Hey, the buck is real."
"So are my plans for rebuilding Redemption, and I'll start with Romeo Baby."
Placing all her hopes for Redemption on a horse like Romeo Baby was smart.
Charging a premium price for his stud service would generate money for the breeding program she wanted to start, and building a reputable name would ensure Redemption a future.
The horse was an untapped goldmine waiting for her return.
Because he was only a couple of days old when his mother died, she bottle-fed the colt, nurtured him, babied him and loved him as though he were a child, orphaned and alone.
The colt was a pitiful thing, and McCrea hadn't given him good odds at survival much less growth.
She refused to give up on him, and in her care, the horse thrived.
Eleanor never gave up on the things she loved.
Romeo Baby was one of the best cutting horses he had ever worked with.
The Quarter horse had a gentle disposition and a unique aura.
An intangible, low current surge of strength and fluidity which allowed for a distinctive harmony between horse and rider.
But more than that, he was smart.
He had a special kind of cow sense all real cutting horses have.
When the reins were loosened, he could isolate a calf and pull it from the herd like a gentle guiding mother.
After Charlie's death, Rose held on to his dream, but Redemption had been running in the red for years with little hope of ever making a profit.
Eleanor knew that, but she, like Rose, held on to the dream.
With the weight of last year's taxes bearing down on her, she was pinching the life out of every penny she had and was working her ass off.
"You should have named the beast Eleanor's Baby."
"He's not a beast and you're just mad because you can't have him."
"What's going to happen to your baby when you leave?"
he asked, knowing she had petitioned Jess to care for the horse.
"I'll give you a hundred dollars for him right now."
His insulting offer was for the sole sake of instigation, and she knew it.
That's what made their flirting quarrels so interesting.
He teased her with a few lighthearted insults, and she retaliated with witty comebacks and pretended to be angry.
It seemed to be the natural migration of their relationship since he came home from college.
He didn't have a clue as to where that migration might lead, and for the moment, he didn't care.
He was content living in whatever moment they had.
A convincing stare of anger narrowed her eyes.
"Your brother has graciously agreed to take care of him, and it will be a cold day in hell before I sell Romeo Baby to you."
He smiled and fought the urge to kiss her, just as he had earlier in the barnyard.
"Colder weather is comin'."
He tried hard to keep his mind centered on the land, but he found himself wandering back to a conversation he had with her a couple of weeks ago.
She was standing on the sidewalk outside of a little boutique on Main Street when he drove by.
He slowed the truck, mesmerized by her simple beauty.
Without knowing why, he parked and made his way over to where she stood admiring a peach dress.
He looped both thumbs in the front pocket of his Wranglers as he gave the dress a keen look of interest.
"Do you think they have it in a thirty-six?"
She fought a grin.
"Maybe, but I think the color is wrong for your eyes."
"Really?"
She bit her bottom lip.
"Yeah, red is your color."
