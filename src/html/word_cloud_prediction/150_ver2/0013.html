"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 0.8007674036320749, 'lexical_unit': 'powerless.a / forceful.a / power.n', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Most, but not all, LUs of this frame are usable in a context that implies a duty or responsibility, concepts related to the Being_obligated frame. However, our analysis is that such interpretations are due to contextual pragmatic strengthening--in other words, a duty is a frequently salient type of purpose that has negative consequences if not achieved."}, {'frame': 'Becoming_aware', 'tfidf': 0.7423177006585611, 'lexical_unit': 'perceive.v / find (oneself).v / observe.v', 'definition': "Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer adding some Phenomenon to their model of the world.

'' The words in this frame take direct objects that denote entities in the world, and indicate awareness of those entities, without necessarily giving any information about the content of the Cognizer's belief or knowledge.

In this process, the Cognizer may either passively perceive the Item and note that it fits the Criteria for a Category, or, alternatively, actively examine the Item for certain Criteria that define a Category (or set of Categorys).    Most members of the frame can also describe a resulting cognitive state of the Cognizer with respect to the Item and Category which no longer requires the current perception or consideration of the Item.  A few LUs (e.g. peg.v, pigeonhole.v) do not readily allow stative interpretation, and a few LUs (e.g. deem.v, regard.v) only allow stative interpretation.

Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Difficulty', 'tfidf': 0.71380674610864, 'lexical_unit': 'a pain in the neck.n / challenging.a / challenge.n', 'definition': 'An Experiencer has an easy or difficult time carrying out an Activity.

NB:  Contrast this frame with Likelihood and Preconditions frames, which involve many of the same lemmas.  Many LUs which might be expected to be found here (should, must, have to) are actually in the Required_event frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Leofric heard it and compassion spilled over from his eyes.
"When Lord Targhe escaped from Calis back to his own lands there were those who wished to pursue him and carry the fight to his lands.
They wished to bring Lord Targhe to justice for the slaughter on the House of Berron."
"'Tis a mercy that King Ine had sense enough to see that it would only have led to a lengthy and bloody war with King Aethelbald, thank goodness we were spared that!"
Finan heaved himself from his seat with a growl.
"Trust Lord Targhe to have had the forethought to align himself and his lands with King Aethelbald before embarking upon his murderous spree!"
He roamed angrily with the force of his convictions.
"The evil knave!
Did you ever hear ought to equal it?
The cold blooded turncoat!
To secure his own safety before lashing out in vile premeditation.
A more cowardly action I cannot conceive, for he knew King Ine would not risk the lives of his subjects for the sake of pride."
Leofric shook his head, he did not like to think that one mad man could wreak such havoc, havoc that other, better men, paid for with their lives.
He could neither understand nor comprehend that a man could kill innocent women and children.
There was no answer and thinking of such things only made him agitated and uncomfortable.
He was young enough to hope that he was in perfect control of his own life, and yet wise enough to know that his control was only partial.
No one directed the path of their life absolutely.
There were only two courses open to anyone; the roads of good and evil.
Just the two.
No matter what anyone else said, there was no opaque grey area.
No sitting on the fence.
Once a path had been chosen, there was no longer choice left, only the correct and right action on one side, and slavery to the depraved on the other.
God was always there to give lives direction, knowing in his infinite wisdom that which was best for each and every person.
In the case of those like Lord Targhe, the Bible was clear enough; they were from their father the devil.
He shivered uncomfortably, as though just discussing the atrocities of the past had brought an oppressive atmosphere of evil into their midst.
"'Tis strange, how far reaching it all has been, how even now its effects are felt."
Finan's eyes met Leofric's with great sadness in their depths.
"Such things should never be forgotten."
Chapter Eight
Rafe watched as Adele pushed a wisp of hair back from her cheek and tucked it behind her ear.
She was unaware of his eyes upon her, all her attention was on the robin that hopped about on the frozen earth, pecking at the crumbs she had scattered for it.
She must be tired, she had to be.
Eda was even now asleep, curled up in the shelter of a fallen log.
It was Eda who had begged for rest, for food, but never once had Adele demanded anything.
No word of complaint had passed her lips, yet still he was uneasy.
Adele and Eda had talk in a desultory manner, but there had been silence between himself and her for too long.
At first he had not noticed, his head was too full of plans and worries for him to spare a thought for conversation.
However, for a long while he had been conscious of the deafening silence between them, and had been made uncomfortable by it.
That was strange in itself because he had been used to long marches from an early age and had never found the quiet awkward before.
Certainly he had never voluntarily conversed with any lady not related to him.
He was surprised to find that the hush had become oppressive.
He longed for her to say something, however inconsequential, to show him that she was not upset that he had ignored her for so long.
Maybe he should talk to her, but he could think of nothing to say.
The robin, encouraged by Adele's stillness and enticed by the crumbs, bravely moved a little nearer.
Adele smiled, breaking another piece of rye bread and crumbling it on to the floor.
The robin fluttered away nervously and Adele laughed.
"'Tis only crumbs, you silly thing."
The robin cocked its head to one side, regarding her speculatively from one beady eye.
A moment later it hopped a little nearer again.
He was so close that Rafe could see with incredible clarity the overlapping feathers on his bright red chest.
He realised that he had never really looked at a robin before, not really looked.
"He's a handsome fellow, isn't he?"
Rafe was startled to hear Adele's warm and friendly voice.
He looked up to find her regarding him from wide, clear eyes.
"Welcome back to the land of the living; you were gone a long time you know."
She was still smiling, there was no reproach in her words.
"I was thinking," answered Rafe apologetically.
"Forgive me, I have not been very good company for you."
"You are worried," shrugged Adele.
"I only hope that you have found some solution to the problem that vexes you so.
It is not pleasant to be always troubled."
She scattered a few more crumbs for the waiting robin.
"You know, this little fellow reminds me of a passage in the Bible."
Adele smiled again.
"When Jesus was teaching upon the Mount of Olives and he said to take a lesson from the lilies of the field because they neither toil nor spin but even Solomon in all his glory was not comparable to one of them."
Her serene eyes drifted up to meet his gaze.
"'Tis true; for I have never yet seen a fabric that could equal this little robin redbreast."
Rafe stared hard into her softly unfocused eyes for some moments.
"You are a very unusual girl."
The words slipped from his mouth before he could check them.
Adele's gaze met his and, for the first time in the short while he had known her, he saw that it was clouded with uncertainty.
He had meant to compliment her, in his own mind it had been a praising description, although it was true that he never meant to speak the words out loud.
It seemed that although she might well be unusual, she did have one thing in common with the rest of her sex.
That was the belief that in a woman, unusual was not an epithet to aspire to.
She had taken the comment to be little better than a slight and was embarrassed, he could tell.
It was with some surprise that he discovered that he would have given a great deal to unsay those words, or to come into possession of others that would assure her of his meaning.
Unfortunately, he had none.
He knew not how to converse with women, although there were many who would have refuted that statement.
Rafe was held as a favourite with ladies; they thought him charming, attentively courteous, and yet still retaining that elusive air of reckless danger.
Rafe had never been easy in their company, it had rendered him silent.
Strangely enough this silence had the effect of inspiring admiration in female hearts.
These ladies believed that his lack of words had betrayed a great depth of emotion and sympathy.
Gradually he had learnt to suffer the discomfort he felt in their presence stoically.
He had never found their conversation particularly interesting, but then again he had not found it to be fraught with as many difficulties as conversation with Adele so often was.
Indeed these ladies would have said, had they been asked, that it was possible to converse with Lord Rafe in complete openness.
Rafe was innately polite, and had always listened to their prattle in well concealed boredom.
These ladies had been left with the impression that he was a wonderfully sensitive man, with whom a lady could always enjoy a deep and meaningful conversation, in which the souls of the principals had been poured out with unrestrained and frank honesty.
The fact that Lord Rafe rarely said a word, but listened in silence while the lady in question divested herself of her opinions on every subject under the sun, completely escaped them.
This left said Lady with the impression that Rafe were something of a fountain of wisdom.
Thankfully there had never been the need to say very much.
It had often been Rafe's reflection that ladies were quite capable of holding a conversation without the participation of a second party.
In fact they seemed vaguely put out when one interrupted them half way through their monologue.
It was different with Adele, she required active participation.
To her conversation was to learn about others, not discussing, at length and in great detail, her own feelings and needs.
He should have found the change refreshing, and in a way he did, but he found it alarming too.
Adele would have been greatly surprised to know that Rafe had any interest in her at all, and her opinion of his last remark was not well defined.
She was conscious of a sinking feeling of disappointment, tangled up with hurt and embarrassment.
It had never occurred to Adele that she might be different to other girls.
She had thought that the whole point of her training at the fort was that she might conform to the idea of a proper wife.
It came as something of a shock to find that this was not so, and she knew a sudden and uncomfortable fear that perhaps she would not please Lord Rafe, that he too would be disappointed.
"Are you thirsty, Lady Adele?"
Rafe didn't know what she was thinking, but he misliked the look of perturbed concentration on her face.
She looked up at him, not having heard what he had said but knowing that he had addressed her.
Her large, troubled eyes met his and he felt as if the breath were knocked from his body.
Suddenly he heard himself speaking.
"I did not mean that!"
He registered the meaning of his words and began to stammer.
"That is... 'tis not that I didn't mean it, 'tis just...
I just..."
He broke off, unsure if his tangled explanations were making it worse.
He was relieved to find that the worry had faded from her eyes and that they were filled with the beginnings of mirth.
"You are funny when you become nervous."
"I am not nervous!"
Rafe looked vaguely revolted by this description.
"It is only that I did not mean it like that."
Again he looked sheepish.
"All I meant was, that to be different... 'tis good... that is, Lord Rafe will be pleased."
He broke off abruptly again.
"You do not think Lord Rafe will mind?"
asked Adele blushing.
"You think he will like it, Finn?"
"I... yes."
Rafe cleared his throat and stood, looking in the direction in which they had come.
The conversation was becoming a little too complicated, too difficult.
He even had a vague suspicion that the discussion should not have been taking place.
As he looked through the trees, his eyes keen and searching, worry entered his face.
Again Adele saw it, saw his mind change track and begin on lines wholly different to those of a few moments before.
He was gone again, lost to her as a companion.
Though his form was still there, standing across from her, his mind was somewhere else, somewhere along the trail that they had traversed, restless, questing, searching for answers, for something that she did not know.
"Finn?"
Rafe turned at the sound of her voice, it was low, gently probing, and for a few seconds he said nothing as he tried to recover his wondering thoughts.
She didn't speak again, did not question him.
Rather she sat looking up, her eyes placid, waiting for him to respond.
He had the feeling that she was not requesting confidences, but merely seeking reassurance; the comfort of companionship with another person.
"You look tired."
"So do you," she replied.
"In truth I think you must be more weary than I; for 'tis you who must bear the responsibility of our journey."
She stole a look up at him from beneath lowered lashes.
"And I think you are plagued by much worry, more even than befits the gravity of our situation."
Rafe was taken back, few were the people who could read his thoughts with such a degree of perspicacity, and rare was the person who could hold their curiosity in check.
She didn't question him further, or try to find out from whence these other worries came.
For some reason her understanding unsettled him.
"We have yet much ground to cover before we make camp tonight, it is best that we move along now."
Adele stood, brushing a few lingering crumbs from the fabric of her cloak.
"Yes indeed we should, for I fear we are to expect rain before the day is much older."
She tilted her head upwards and gazed up at the darkening sky.
Rafe was pretty sure that they were in for a drenching and that the rain would last for some time.
However much he might have with otherwise, there was no option but to continue through it.
Adele bent to touch Eda's shoulder lightly.
"Eda... wake up, we have to move on now."
