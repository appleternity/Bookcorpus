"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 3.3399499019692556, 'lexical_unit': 'power.n / force.n / might.n', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In this sense Colonization is distinct from migration or exodus.  'In the 7th century BC, Phoenicians colonized the eastern section of Libya.'

"Look at this," said Lawson.
He held up a diagram of the Rabaul waterfront, which showed gun emplacements and Japanese writing.
Amongst the papers, they found a list of residents the Japanese were to arrest and execute when they captured Rabaul.
Both their names were on it.
"So that little scumbag has been drawing up lists of people to be shot!"
shouted Lawson.
"He goes around smiling and bowing to everyone, but all the time he's making it easier for his mates to capture Rabaul and execute the residents they don't like.
He's a dead man."
They collected all the papers and diagrams they could find and took them to the car.
Driving back to headquarters, Milne walked in and found his commander and several senior officers in conference.
His ashen-faced commander said, "The Japanese attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbour several hours ago.
America and Australia have declared war on Japan."
Chapter 25
Milne knew that it was only a matter of time before the Japanese tried to capture Rabaul.
A day after the attack on Pearl Harbour, a group of settlers gathered around the radio at his house listening to Prime Minister John Curtin's war speech: "Men and women of Australia...we are at war with Japan.
This is the gravest hour of our history.
We Australians have imperishable traditions.
We shall maintain them.
We shall hold this country and keep it as a citadel for the British-speaking race and as a place where civilisation will persist."
Some settlers wanted to return to Australia while others said they would stay.
A plantation owner from Kokopo said he would stay until it became clear the Japanese were going to attack Rabaul.
"Bloody hell," said Lawson.
"Are you all living in fucking wonderland?
The Japanese will attack.
Best port in the area.
And you can forget about your plantations - the Japanese will take those and you'll end up prisoners.
And we all know how the Japs treat prisoners."
"It's not over yet," said another.
"The Japs have to get down here.
The British navy will stop them.
They have the battle cruisers HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse patrolling the sea lanes, as soon as the Japs leave land, these ships will deal with them."
A Rabaul shop owner joined them saying he had heard that Curtin had ordered the immediate return home of Australian divisions fighting in North Africa.
He added that these battle-hardened divisions would give the Japanese a sound thrashing if they came near Malaya or New Guinea.
"And how long before they get here?"
demanded Lawson.
"Bloody months.
By then the Japs will be on top of us."
"What about you Francis?"
asked a settler.
"I hear Mary is setting up house in Sydney, are you going to join her?"
"No, not yet.
I have some unfinished business.
Tankara slipped through our fingers and I'm going find him if it's the last thing I do."
Lawson added, "And I'm not going anywhere.
Me and Francis are going to stick it out."
A few days later, coast watchers spotted the first of many Japanese aircraft flying over Rabaul.
Rumours flew around the town that an attack on Rabaul was imminent.
Every day, more alarming news filtered in; a day after the assault on Pearl Harbour, the Japanese attacked Hong Kong and invaded Malaya.
A day later, Japanese aircraft sank the Prince of Wales and Repulse, which was a huge blow to morale of the soldiers and settlers in Rabaul.
Japanese troops overwhelmed the small American garrison on Guam the same day, and advanced south into Indo-China and Thailand.
Meanwhile, Milne's commanding officer ordered him to hunt down the spy network.
Milne decided to use Jansen as bait to catch Frickner and Tankara.
He threatened that unless she cooperated, he would charge her with spying which carried a long prison sentence in Australia.
She agreed to cooperate and said that Frickner might be hiding on her plantation and she offered to show them all the places he might be.
They drove to Jansen's house, Lawson driving and Milne in the back seat with Jansen keeping an eye on her.
He took the precaution of handcuffing her in case she tried something.
She protested and begged but Milne refused to take the handcuffs off.
They parked in the jungle near her house and peered through the foliage.
There were no signs of activity.
Lawson, gun in hand, walked towards the house while Milne remained with Jansen in the jungle.
A few minutes later, he signalled to them.
"Everything is gone!"
she cried, when she stepped into her empty house.
"They took all the furniture and my clothes."
A plantation worker said that two days before, Frickner and Tankara had forced several workers to help them load up the car and truck with clothes, bedding and pots and pans, and then left, saying they would be back in a few weeks.
They paid several men to guard her property but as soon as they had left, the local villagers had helped themselves to what was left of her property.
Milne questioned her servants and one of them said that Frickner and Tankara might have gone to Toma.
They searched the plantation grounds.
Milne kept hold of her while they were searching.
She showed them a cottage, which was one of Frickner's hideouts.
After searching the area around the plantation, they sought out John Marsden.
He had not seen or heard anything suspicious in the area but he said everyone was preoccupied with the war.
"What will become of us if the Japanese come?"
he asked Milne.
"Should I leave the island?"
"I can't answer that," he replied.
"Each person needs to decide what to do."
"My advice is to get out while you can," added Lawson.
"Unless you intend to fight the Japs you should get back to Australia quick smart before Tojo arrives in town."
Marsden nodded and started making plans to exit New Guinea.
Milne and Lawson took Jansen back to Rabaul.
While Jansen had been cooperative and minimised her guilt, there was no doubt in their minds that she had engaged in espionage.
"The question now, Mrs Jansen, is what we are to do with you," said Milne back at HQ.
Lawson sat opposite her with a smirk.
As far as he was concerned, there was no question of her guilt.
She bowed her head admitting she had done wrong but she had not engaged in spying activity.
It was all Frickner, Friberg and Tankara.
She said she was in love with Friberg and supported him but did not know about the spying.
As she minimised her role in the network, she wept tears of remorse at the loss of her lover, her property and her freedom.
Lawson leaned forward, "You must think we were born yesterday.
What a load of crap you are telling us.
You are a spy.
We have enough evidence to charge you with espionage."
"Please, you must believe me.
I'm innocent.
I knew nothing about what they were doing.
They used me as cover and threatened to kill me if I reported on them."
"If you help us, we might reduce the charges, but you will be deported to Australia for internment as an enemy alien."
She looked up and wiped the tears from her eyes.
"I'll help in any way I can."
Milne asked where in Toma Tankara might be hiding.
She replied that her husband had owned a house and land on the edge of the town.
They often went there to escape the tropical heat of the lowlands.
She gave him the exact location of the house.
Milne placed her in custody and recommended to his commander that the military deport her to Australia for internment.
His commander agreed and she was imprisoned pending deportation.
They drove to Toma, parked near the house and hid in the trees to watch.
The house appeared to be uninhabited.
An hour after they staked out the house, they saw Tankara's servant walk out the back door, hang washing and go back inside.
"What do you reckon?"
asked Milne.
"Tankara and Frickner might be inside."
He pulled out his gun and walked slowly to the back of the house while Lawson covered him.
Milne pushed the door open and pointed his gun at the servant.
"Where's Frickner and Tankara?"
He stood staring at Milne, a look of terror on his face.
"I'm not going to hurt you.
Where are they?"
He pointed into the room at the front of the house.
Milne called in Lawson and asked him to cover the servant.
He crept into the front room and saw Tankara lying asleep on the couch.
He called Lawson in. Milne motioned to him to search the rest of the house to find Frickner but he was not there.
Lawson walked over to Tankara and pushed him with his foot.
"What is it...I'm trying to ..."
He turned and saw Lawson pointing his gun at his head.
Milne stepped forward.
"You are under arrest for espionage."
Tankara sat up rubbing his eyes.
He did not seem worried, and declared his innocence arguing that he fled from Rabaul after the attack on Pearl Harbour because he feared the authorities would intern him.
He denied spying on the Australian military.
"Search him," said Milne.
Lawson walked over to Tankara and said, "Stand up and don't try anything."
Tankara stood up put his hands in the air.
He roughly searched him.
"Thought you'd get away with it did you?
You'll be lucky if we don't shoot you on the spot."
"Don't move or you're both dead," said a voice behind them.
"Throw your guns on the floor and put your hands up."
Milne looked over his shoulder.
It was Klaus Frickner pointing a rifle at them.
Milne realised that if he turned to shoot, Frickner would kill him and Lawson.
They threw their weapons down.
Tankara picked up their guns.
He laughed.
"What fools you Australians are.
What amateurs.
If this is the best that your pathetic government sends against the might of Japan, your insignificant little country will soon belong to us.
Yes, I am a spy.
You have found out my little secret.
But it will do you no good because your world is about to change forever."
