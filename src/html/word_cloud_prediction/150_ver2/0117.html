Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves .

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

She was already curled under the covers and asleep.
The sound of Rachel's engine stopped me from lying next to her.
I stripped, put my clothes away, and settled on the end of the bed, careful of my bruised ribs.
*    *    *    * Tuesday was a repeat of Monday.
Gabby went to school, and I went to work.
The scent of werewolf drifted to me throughout the day, and I left early again.
Like the day before, the scent grew stronger as I neared the vacant building.
Only this time, it wasn't a single scent, but three.
I knew I wouldn't make it home before Gabby.
Walking around the building, I retraced my steps.
As I'd anticipated, the shallow bruises from the day before had already healed.
I doubted I'd heal as quickly from three fights in a row.
The bruising would go much deeper.
I stepped inside and found the three challengers.
Though I could see they planned to fight as men, I stripped down to nothing anyway.
"Just give up now," one of the men said.
"Sure you might win the first fight or two, but do you really think you can win three in a row?"
I waved the first one forward in answer.
The guy shook his head.
"Whether you win this fight or not, Gabby's no longer yours.
You had your chance.
Elder Joshua has granted any interested male permission to approach her without supervision."
Shit.
I struggled to control my temper.
I'd asked for controlled Introductions.
Sam had said he would see what he could do.
When I hadn't heard more, I'd thought...what had I thought?
No answer didn't mean a yes.
With a growl, I launched myself at the first challenger.
I needed to get home.
*    *    *    * It was past midnight when I left the building.
I stopped at a gas station to clean up.
I had a split lip and blood on my knuckles and in my beard.
Most of the blood in my beard wasn't my own.
Letting myself in the back door, I listened for Gabby's soft breathing.
She was safely asleep in bed.
No other sounds drifted through the house, which meant Rachel wasn't home yet.
Some of the remaining tension melted from my chest.
As I stripped and then changed into a clean shirt and shorts, I considered the challenges.
I'd taken my time and paced myself, careful not to expend all my energy up front.
But in the end, the third challenger had almost beaten me.
What would Gabby have done if she'd woken, and I still hadn't returned?
Her comment from Monday's dinner led me to believe she would have tried to find me, that we weren't done.
Yet, what were we?
Friends?
I needed her to start seeing us as more than that.
I carefully lay next to her, wincing at the soreness along my back.
She seemed to sense me in her sleep because she shifted closer.
I put my hands behind my head and let her use me as a pillow.
With her cheek on my chest, I wished I'd left off the shirt.
Once she settled, I sighed deeply and fell asleep.
*    *    *    * She moved, a slight nod that rubbed her cheek against my chest.
It was a pleasant way to wake up.
She lifted her head, and I opened my eyes.
"It's annoying not being able to see you," she said softly as she propped herself up on her elbows to study me.
"If you don't talk, and I can't see your face, how am I ever supposed to figure out what you're thinking?"
She reached out to push my hair back, but I caught her wrist.
She wouldn't like what she saw.
I doubted the bruises had faded from last night.
"Seriously, Clay, what kind of bribe is it going to take for you to get rid of some of that hair?"
I bared my teeth, hoping my excuse would work this time, too.
"Can't we at least trim it back some?"
Her desire to look at me had me tugging her hand to my chest and laying it flat.
I wanted her to see me, not just the outside but inside, too.
My heart was hers.
All that I was belonged to her.
She watched me with a slightly amused expression.
Her tousled hair haloed her head in appealing disarray.
Her lips parted, and my gaze drifted there.
I could handle a thousand more challenges if only for one kiss.
Barely breathing, I lifted my free hand and tapped my mouth.
"What, you want me to be mute like you?"
She was killing me.
I shook my head and reached out, cupping her jaw and lightly running my thumb over her bottom lip.
My pulse thundered in my ears.
She froze, then her eyes widened.
All trace of amusement fled her expression.
"Whoa!"
she said as she flew from the bed, almost falling off it in her haste to put distance between us.
My hand slowly fell to the mattress.
She didn't stop backing up until she hit the dresser, and then she clutched it as if she needed the support.
I saw her tremble and frowned.
Had I misread our relationship?
Did she truly not see me as a potential Mate?
I waited.
We watched each other.
After a minute, she loosened her hold and nervously wiped her hand on her leg.
I wished I knew what she was thinking.
As she continued to study me, her expression of fear melted away to one of slow amazement followed by a deep blush, which I found curious.
Her amazement vanished and a sudden panicked look took its place.
She was shifting through emotions too fast for me to understand.
I'd thought the amazement and blush a good thing, but why had it caused her to panic?
Then her gaze drifted to my throat.
I wanted to groan and close my eyes.
Her reactions were confusing torment.
Want me or don't, just decide soon.
She took several slow, deep breaths, wiped her hands on her pajamas again, then, finally she moved.
She didn't flee the room, as I'd half-expected, but edged toward the bed.
Her teeth caught her lower lip, making it hard for me to breathe.
"I have some questions before we talk about my bribe and your price."
What bribe?
What price?
I thought back to our conversation--her conversation--and realized she thought I wanted a kiss in exchange for trimming my hair.
She crawled back upon the bed and sat on her heels beside me.
"Will you try to answer my questions?"
I waited, unsure of her questions.
"Are you able to physically speak?"
I nodded.
"Are you ever planning on talking to me?"
That question hinted at a long-term future.
I smiled wide and nodded again.
"Clay," she said hesitantly, "were you asking for a kiss?"
I'd never wanted anything more.
I nodded and reached out to twine my fingers with hers.
She let me, and I ran my thumb over the skin of her hand.
"Clay, I can't even see your mouth to know where to kiss.
I hope this bargain includes a shave."
My heart stopped.
Was that a yes?
I didn't move, afraid I was dreaming it.
She pulled her hand from mine so she could set both hands on my shoulders.
I felt the slight tremble in her fingertips as she slowly leaned over me.
Her nervousness almost blocked the scent of her anticipation.
She closed her eyes a moment before her lips settled on me.
She hovered there, lightly pressing her mouth against mine.
I held still, wanting so much more and afraid to do something to scare her away.
She moved slighting, angling the chaste kiss as she reached up to gently brush her fingers along my face, exploring my forehead, ear, and jaw.
I couldn't hold back.
I tilted my head and started to nibble at her lips.
Her desire changed to panic, and I cursed myself as she pulled away and opened her eyes.
Her shock and gasp made my heart sink.
Was she so afraid of a kiss?
"What happened?"
Her concern confused me.
"I thought werewolves weren't supposed to get hurt like this."
Crap.
She'd moved my hair and was staring at my blackened face.
Wait.
Did that mean she hadn't minded the kiss, then?
Before the thought could firmly settle in my mind, she bounded off the bed again.
"A deal's a deal.
Go shower and shave.
After you're done, we can play charades until I have the story behind the black eye."
Screw the black eye, I wanted her back on the bed.
"That or I call Sam."
I ran my hand through my hair in frustration, then sighed and sat up.
The mood was obviously broken.
Swinging my feet over the bed, I turned away from her, ready to go take a cold shower when she came rushing over to me again.
I didn't stand.
She'd be able to reach my lips easier this way.
