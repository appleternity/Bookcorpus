Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'  'My life instantly changed from an empty life, to a life full of joy and purpose.'  'As you can see, the word WALK changed from red to green rather than have a separate lens for each colour.'  'My feet turned to stone.'  'The promise will turn to ashes if progress is not made.'  'The price  changed from $1.26 to $1.27 per pint. DNI'  'At least one relative instruction has changed in size from short to long.'  In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.  'The nation was crawling towards oblivion.' 'We were walking past almost reasonable and heading right for what-the-bleep.'

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Roadways', 'tfidf': 0.6096494109976605, 'lexical_unit': 'road.n / autobahn.n / bypass.n', 'definition': "This frame involves stable Roadways which connect two stable Endpoints, the Source and the Goal.

Now she was alone.
As if on cue, the sound of Carter exiting the house brought his goony fourteen-year-old younger brother down the stairs.
She heard him plod quickly down the steps, but then he slowed on the last one to casually turn the corner into view.
As handsome as Carter was, his brother Jeffrey wasn't.
Whereas Carter's eyes were dashing, Jeffrey squinted and leered, and the freckles near his eyes made him look like he was high.
While Carter was well built, Jeffrey's muscles were solely the result of excessive masturbation.
And then there was his personality.
"Oh, hi, Avery!
I wasn't expecting you.
I always knew you'd realize you had the wrong Thomson brother.
I'm glad you came around now, because the Sailor Moon outfit I ordered for you just came in the mail.
We could, you know..."
Creeped out to the max, Avery cringed, putting out her hand to keep him away.
"Actually, I'm here with Carter.
We're back together now," she said, despite proof to the contrary running through her mind.
A shocked expression came to Jeffrey's face, but he soon let it pass in favor of more disturbing gazes.
"Really?
Huh!
I didn't see that coming.
Well anyway, I'm happy for you," he said.
Avery nodded and turned away, but he wasn't done talking.
"I read somewhere about the funniest thing.
There was this guy who went to visit his older brother at college.
He was sleeping in his brother's bed and woke up to find his brother's girlfriend giving him a blowjob!
Can you believe it?
I guess things like that do happen, probably not even at college all the time.
I can see how that might be awkward for the girl, you know, accidentally blowing your boyfriend's brother, but I want you to know if a mistake like that ever happens I would be okay with it."
Horrified, Avery didn't know what to say.
Fortunately, the yapping dog signaled Carter's return, and she leeched onto him as soon as he walked through the door.
"We have to go to your room, now!"
she begged.
"Whoa, ok," he assented, giving his brother a look.
She dragged him to the stairs, leaving Jeffrey behind.
She still felt as though she would vomit any second, but shutting the door to Carter's bedroom did bring her some relief.
The rest of the world was out there, and they were in here, and they could finally, finally reconnect.
Carter picked up a piece of mail that had been set on the dresser for him.
It was a purple envelope that had no return address.
Avery climbed onto the bed as he opened it, learning over to tug on his shirt when he didn't come right away.
Removing the small slip of paper he read the frilly, scripted words.
"I can't wait to see you again?"
he puzzled.
"Did you write this?"
But Avery couldn't care less about whatever it was he was doing or talking about.
She sunk a finger into his waistband to tug him closer to the bed, but he jumped like his ass was on fire.
"Whoa, easy!"
he gasped, backing up.
Smiling, Avery wasn't about to let him go.
Slinking out of the bed, she approached him, her eyes on him, her hair flowing around her face, and breathing heavily.
Carter bumped up against the wall.
"I want you to listen to me, Carter, and I want you to do what I say.
We've waited long enough and I can't take it anymore.
You're going to tear off my clothes, throw me on the bed, and fuck me so hard the bed breaks because if I don't have you inside me in ten seconds I'm going to scream.
Ok?"
she closed sweetly, leaning in and planting the gentlest kiss on his cheek.
Carter had broken into a sweat, and his skin went beet red.
He shuddered, twitching a bit, and Avery had just enough time to peer at him curiously before the smell of Cool Ranch Doritos made it to her nose.
"UNNNGFFF," he wheezed.
"Oh, Carter, why?"
she gasped.
Avery closed her eyes, crushed.
Her fingers and toes ached with unfulfilled desire.
"I...I just," he stammered.
Avery didn't scream, instead she started laughing.
The first chuckles sputtered through her lips, making Carter seem even more uncomfortable.
"After all the times I made fun of you for being quick you did this to get back at me, right?
That's what you were doing in the bathroom, putting yourself right on the edge so you could pay me back.
I get it.
Hardy harr harr.
Ok, we'll just have to wait a few minutes before we can try again," she said, taking a seat on the bed.
Carter didn't even crack a smile though, and he just kept shaking his head, pinned against the wall, cream in his shorts.
He looked pale as a sheet.
Avery's phone rang, and it quickly became apparent her plan would not work out the way she wanted.
"Hey, Mom, what do you want?
I'm a little busy now.
Why is Lori at a Lamaze class?
She's only been pregnant for like a few weeks.
Can't you pick her up?
This is really inconvenient!
Oh, all right.
Lori doesn't need a Lamaze class though; she needs a doctor!
Yeah, I know.
Fine, bye."
"That's an awful shame you've got to get going," Carter sighed.
"Family comes first though, and you've got to do what you've got to do.
We'll catch up soon, I promise."
He had a cheesy grin on that made Avery wonder.
Did he want her to leave?
Everything felt so weird and she didn't know what to do about it.
Right now, there was only one thing she could do, pick up her pregnant twelve-year-old sister.
* A group of walrus-like expectant mothers waddled out of a downtown community center late that afternoon.
Her head against the steering wheel, Avery watched for her sister, sulked, and drooled on her jeans.
When Lori finally emerged, weaving through the protruding bellies, Avery thought of how it wasn't too long ago when she was in the car with her mother picking Lori up from elementary school.
Groping through her memory, it seemed like just a couple of years ago, when in fact it had been just a couple of years ago.
"Hit the gas before I kill somebody," Lori said when she climbed into the front seat.
"No problem," Avery sighed, lethargically shifting the car into drive.
Her glum expression couldn't be clearer, but Lori seemed too preoccupied to notice.
"Those moms think it's so cute I went to Lamaze class," Lori ranted, venom in her voice.
"They say, oh, it'll be a long time till you're a mother, and, don't you have a little growing up to do?
Little do they know!
In just a few years time, my kid's gonna be kicking their kids' asses all over the playground.
I've already got the perfect name for him figured out, Hannibal."
Just when Avery thought the hole in her stomach couldn't get any bigger, it did.
"You can't name your child Hannibal.
You just can't do it!
I thought you wanted him to be a politician anyway.
Nobody's going to elect anybody named Hannibal," she reasoned, stepping on the gas.
"No," Lori corrected her.
"The politician will come later.
The first one is going to be a serial-killing sniper...with an afro!
Yeah, that would be cool.
That's how I'll wipe out my enemies and start building my family empire."
Every word felt like a drill to Avery's head.
None of it made sense.
"What enemies could you possibly have?
You're a twelve-year-old girl!"
"Well, first of all there's the boy in my class who never lends me a pencil even though he has like a hundred.
He's got to go.
Then there's the homeless guy outside of the liquor store.
He'll buy for anybody else but when I ask he's suddenly got the morals of a preacher.
Them...and a bunch of others.
Hannibal will be a busy boy doing mommy's dirty work."
Avery didn't even bother to respond.
Everything was just ridiculous beyond belief, and the more talking her sister did, the crazier it all became.
The only solution was to shut it all out and give herself one moment to sort through her fragmented thoughts.
A honking horn snapped her back and she jerked the wheel to right the car on the proper side of the road.
What just happened?
Clutching the wheel, she stared at the road ahead of her.
"Are you ok?"
Lori asked, one hand on the door and the other on her stomach.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Avery brushed her off, flicking the blinker and making a turn.
"No, really, tell me what the problem is."
Lori's demands were hard to object to when Avery really did feel like she needed to talk to someone.
She couldn't tell her friends because it would make her seem weak.
It was too embarrassing.
But she didn't want to confide in her sister either because she might be too young to understand, and it might burden her with sticky relationship details she wasn't ready to know about.
Squeezing her fingers around the steering wheel, she clenched her face, finally giving in.
"I guess it's not that big a deal," Avery downplayed it.
"I was so happy when I got back together with Carter, but now things are different.
I can't put my finger on it exactly, but he's always so shy and reserved around me now.
He used to be, you know, really intense.
Just all the time.
Now, it's like he doesn't want to look at me.
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but it's been almost a week and we still haven't...made love."
"You mean fucked?"
"No!"
Avery cried, pained at hearing her precious sister cursing.
"I mean been intimate."
"You mean bent over in front of the sink and pounded from behind while your hair gets in the dish water?"
"Oh my God.
No!
