Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Then she would have gladly abdicated her right to the throne and given herself to Orlson and as long as they had the Crux and her crew she would be the happiest woman in Celestia, but that was impossible.
There was no one else.
It was her right and her right alone.
Xander stood with his eyes closed as Dorcas told him what to do.
He imagined the sound and feel of the rain on his skin and the sea filling his insides, then opening his eyes he said  'Water!'
Red flames escaped his hands, hitting an empty barrel.
Dorcas put the fire out just as Bri yelled at them.
'What in Hecate's name do you think you're doing?
Could you not have started with water?
This is my wooden ship you're on.'  'That is what I was doing,' Xander apologized.
'Well it looked like a fire to me,' she snapped before disappearing below.
Dorcas took him by the arm.
'Don't worry too much.
It might be safer for you to practice once we hit land,' she said.
The Third passed them, his arms filled with brushes and buckets and struggling to stay on his feet.
'I wonder what is wrong?'
Xander said realising Briganti was not in the best of moods.
The Third tripped and the sound of the buckets crashing filled their ears.
'Ppprincess and Orlson had a big fight.
She punched him, Your Highness,' he said hurriedly as Dorcas tried to help him.
'Is it me or is their relationship odd?'
Xander asked.
Dorcas shrugged.
'We were close once.'  'Yes we were, but he is to her what Surrial is to me and we do not treat each other in an informal manner like that,' Xander mused.
'She is bound to you and that's all that matters,' Dorcas offered.
'Yes, but she never looks at me like she looks at him.'
If they had not bumped into Dorcas he would have felt put out and angry at the obvious chemistry between Briganti and her guardian.
But he could not be a hypocrite, especially when he still had feelings for his own childhood sweetheart.
Just seeing her again stirred up old emotions he thought were dead.
Her dark hair cropped short still shone in the sunlight and her skin glowed.
She knew him better than he knew himself and he loved her for it.
This marriage was set to be doomed.
Why on earth did their parents have to interfere?
Why could they not have waited until they were old enough to make that decision on their own?
Chapter Fifteen
To everyone's relief the sky darkened as the Crux silently cut through the smooth sea like a hot knife through butter.
Her passengers, apart from Eyes and the Second, who was manning the wheel, had finally given into their exhausted body clocks and were sleeping.
The wind gently blew her delicate sails and dark clouds began to block out the weak sun and moon.
Rain started to fall on to the dry wood that was her body.
Never in her life had she known such anger and resentment sitting deep within her boughs.
She had been to lands afar and seen many things as well as many weathers.
Her companions loved her and she knew it.
Her body was well maintained and even when they climbed her it was done with care and grace.
And she loved them too.
It was her job to see them safe and she was proud to do so.
Her life had been filled with adventure, love and laughter and all that had changed since she had carried her beloved owner to meet her betrothed.
Now her heart ached as she was steered towards the unknown.
Below, inside his swinging hammock, Orlson tossed and turned, threatening at any moment to fall out.
In his dreams, he was inside a dark place that stank of rotting flesh.
Then odd flashes allowed him to catch a glimpse of a place that he had never seen in his life, but it gave him chills to be there.
He could also hear a warm voice calling him.
He then heard Bri calling his name and as he neared her face was filled with disgust and horror at him.
She was falling on her knees and begging him not to do it, yet he could not escape the look in her eyes.
She hated him.
'LAND AHOY!'
His eyes snapped open at Eyes' holler.
Struggling to his feet he kicked the First, who was beneath him.
'Watch what you're doing, you idiot,' he snapped.
'Sorry,' Orlson mumbled, eventually finding his footing.
'You will be, pretty boy,' the First sneered.
'Whatever First,' he replied making his way to the stairwell.
There she was pushing her hair beneath the large floppy hat she liked to wear.
He hated her wearing it, because it hid her eyes from view.
But that was Bri, always hiding.
Bri reached the deck to be greeted with the familiar smell of home.
Gunpowder and burning fires mixed with the fresh rain gave her that warming feeling.
Dorcas came up beside her, wrapping a cloak Bri had lent her around her shoulders.
'Is this Hades?' she asked.
'Yes it is,' Bri said almost too defensively.
'It is fantastic.
I think I rule the wrong kingdom.'
Bri looked at her with surprise, a Zolar complimenting Zilva.
'What?'
Dorcas asked noticing Bri's surprised stare.
'Nothing, it's something I did not expect you to say,' Bri said smiling.
Dorcas shrugged.
'How long will we be staying?'  'It seems to be night here, though at the moment it is hard to tell, and we are all over the place at the moment.
We will go in the morning.
That will at least give us time for some rest.'
Once the Crux was safely docked, the crew quickly scattered, not before Bri threw out instructions to meet at dawn.
Surrial stood protectively over Xander as though he was gold.
'I do not want you out of my sight,' Surrial said stiffly, eyeing his surroundings with unease.
'You will find an inn called The Royal Moon.
You will find it suitable,' Bri said, not hiding her growing frustration at their attitude.
Dorcas took her arm.
'Why don't you show me what is so famous about this island?' she offered.
'Orlson!'
Bri closed her eyes and gritted her teeth at a high squeal that belonged to Croenda.
She turned just in time to see Orlson catch the woman in mid leap with a grunt.
Her black hair hung wet and long from the rain as she began to shower Orlson with kisses, her breasts threatening to fall out of the low cut dress that she wore.
'What took you so long?' she asked, as he let her drop to her feet.
But then her face changed as her hands ran down his arm.
'This is supposed to be off.
She was supposed to married,' she spat nodding in Bri's direction.
Bri made to speak, however, Dorcas stopped her.
'So, these inns,' she said dragging her away from the potential fight.
Xander and Surrial walked through the ramshackle streets of Hades.
Music and song also filled the air mixed with smell of cooked pig and other animals.
Rain, having turned the streets underfoot to mud made it difficult to walk.
Small fires burned in the streets and cooked fish and pigs and made Xander's stomach grumble, but Surrial urged them to wait until they reached the inn.
Outside the huts, goblins and gypsies gambled drunkenly with dice and cards, which brought cheers and shouts.
Xander began to have some understanding as to why Briganti was the way she was.
This was a world away from the civilized streets of Zolar, or at least it used to be.
He shook the thought of home from his mind, he needed to keep focused.
Finally, they spotted an old thatched building that seemed to be brimming with activity.
The sign outside told them it was the inn Bri had recommended.
Once inside, they both spotted a table in the corner where Orlson, Clues, Eyes and the woman who had bounded past them at the dock were sitting.
By the way she was all over Orlson, Xander guessed that she was Croenda.
The landlady welcomed them with open arms and found them rooms to sleep in, telling them to take a seat and she would bring food and drinks over.
It was so rare to find a place run by a woman, but it was easy to see she was not one to be messed with.
She was small in stature, but she had a look of murder in her eye if pushed.
Tiredness came quickly to Surrial as he sat down.
His dreams on the ship had been filled with nightmares mixed with individual vibrations of the crew.
The princess, Briganti, he found frustrating and tiresome, but he had to admit her strength was something to be envied and that deserved some of his respect.
After all, he would have to learn to love her as his High Queen, even if the chemistry between her and her guardian, which was so obvious, disturbed him.
Something was not right about that man and as he sat beside him and watched him being pawed by a tramp of a woman he trusted him even less.
'Nice to meet you your majesty,' he heard the woman called Croenda say to Prince Xander.
'Nice to meet you too, I have heard so much about you,' Xander replied.
'Really?' the woman screeched.
'All good I hope.
Although it depends who did the talking,' she said cryptically 'Well I must go, it is my turn to entertain the crowds.'
Surrial watched with a curl of his lip as she provocatively moved past the Prince and for once he agreed with the Princess's opinion, this woman was hateful.
Bri and Dorcas entered the inn just as Croenda was starting her song.
Bri felt her mood drop as she watched her walk towards where Orlson and Xander sat, both engrossed in her dance moves.
'Typical, give them a bit of flesh and they're any bodies,' Dorcas commented, pulling Bri towards the bar.
'Two ales,' she said to the landlady.
The landlady looked at Bri and took her hand gently.
'Give my respects to your mother, Briganti, these are on the house.'  'Thanks I appreciate it,' Bri replied turning back toward the room.
'She is a gypsy right?'
Dorcas asked, eyeing Croenda.
Bri nodded gulping down her drink.
It was becoming apparent standing there watching Croenda and Orlson, that this was the life he would live once she married.
They would no doubt have children, many children.
Would they be like him or her?
She grabbed the jug and downed its contents.
She could not think about it anymore.
'Hey.
You'll be ill in the morning,' Dorcas said grabbing the jug from her.
'Look, let's show these men how we royals do things.'
Bri glanced at her.
'What do you mean?'
Dorcas merely smiled and dragged her off.
Xander could see Surrial was tired and made to get up and leave when suddenly in the middle of Croenda's song and dance, a familiar pair of voices rose above her.
Both he and Orlson sat up in their seats with shock for on top of the bar, Dorcas and Briganti stood singing Croenda's song and judging by her face, Croenda was fuming, as the crowd jumped up and began to cheer.
He had never seen either of them so relaxed and they were both glowing, he sensed a little charm was being worked in an attempt to steal the light from Croenda and it was working.
But for what purpose he had no idea, she was not a patch on either of them.
The men in the inn were now on their feet as the two princesses danced on the tables.
Croenda, giving up, succumbed to placing herself beside Orlson, but he too got to his feet to watch them.
It seemed the place had come alive and the more they danced, the more the place cheered.
