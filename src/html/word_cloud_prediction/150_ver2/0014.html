A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.'

Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities.

When the officer began to speak, Michael could barely understand him.
Somehow, he managed to gather that Ted had died the night prior and had left a note for Michael.
It was apparently sitting on the table between the two chairs, with a fresh pack of cigarettes resting on top.
The officer handed Michael the pack of cigarettes and the note, turning around and walking away without any further word.
Michael threw the cigarettes and the note on the kitchen table, heading towards the bedroom and falling into his bed.
Sleep came easier than it ever had before, but Michael hadn't completely registered what happened.
When Michael woke up later that day, he looked out the window and tried to figure out what time it was.
The sun had set long before he fell asleep, as the moon was already high in the sky.
He garnered a guess that it was around midnight, given the position of the moon.
Walking through the kitchen, he grabbed the pack of cigarettes off of the table and headed towards the door.
Then, paused and remembered seeing the note on the table.
He walked out towards the street, telling himself to make sure he read it when he got home.
Had to go have the usual evening talk with Ted.
Just before he hit the street, however, he figured that Ted would probably want to read it regardless.
He took it and jammed it in his pocket, crossing the street to Ted's house again.
He paused at the edge of the lawn, fear pricking the back of his skull.
Every light in Ted's house was turned off and there wasn't any sign of activity.
Ted's car sat in it's usual spot in the driveway and when Michael put his hand on the hood, he realized it was ice cold.
He walked up the stairs to the porch and opened the screen door, noting that there wasn't the normal smoldering cigarette in the ashtray.
He knocked on the door softly, thinking there was a chance that Ted had given up on tonight's talk, instead choosing to go to bed.
Michael fell into his assigned chair on the porch, he took the note out of his pocket and threw it on the table between the chairs.
It landed with a thud, as though there was something inside of it.
He ripped open the envelope and a key fell out, bouncing on the table.
Michael flipped the envelope over and stared at the front of it.
It was Ted's scratchy handwriting.
Tears welled up in Michael's eyes again, as he started to put it all together.
The memory of the police officer coming to his house replayed in his mind, although what was said was still a bit fuzzy.
He pulled the note out of the envelope and spread it out over his lap, the tears streaming down his face as he read the letter.
Michael, 
If you're reading this, then it means that it's all over for your old friend Ted.
There isn't anything that I can tell you here that I haven't told you a thousand times before.
I know that you're a smart kid.
I know that you have a firm grasp on reality and a firm grasp on what you want out of life.
With my passing, you now have two houses to care for.
I would suggest either selling or renting one of them, to be honest.
As I told you, I have also left you a sizable amount of money, but it's not going to last forever.
I appreciate the time that we shared together.
I appreciate the talks we had.
I appreciate that you actually helped me realize that there is hope for humanity as a whole.
I know that life has thrown you a lot of curve balls, but you have managed to take them in stride.
For that and everything that you have accomplished, I commend you.
Included with this note is the key to my, well, your house.
Feel free to go inside and help yourself to whatever you want.
After all, it's yours now.
I have no other family, other than you.
My wife's passing left me childless and since I have no brothers or sisters, there really is no next of kin for me.
If anybody questions the things that I have said in this letter, kindly show them the will that I have in a box underneath my bed.
It is notarized and signed by my lawyer.
Michael, I wish you all the best in all that you do.
I know that we will meet again one day, hopefully later, rather than sooner.
You were the closest thing that I ever had to a son and I wouldn't trade the time that we shared together for anything on this Earth.
I feel my lungs starting to collapse, so I'd better bring this to a close.
You and I both know how strong you are.
Use it to your advantage, son.
Your surrogate father, Ted Shepler.
Michael moved the note to the table, picking up the key.
The tears began to slow and Michael felt like he could no longer cry.
He couldn't handle the pain of tears anymore.
So much had happened to him, that he felt like he couldn't actually cry anymore.
Instead of mourning the death of those around him, he entertained the idea of joining them.
It would be so easy to blow his own head off, just to spend the rest of eternity surrounded by those that he loved and wanted to see again.
Instead, he thought, he would carry on the legacy that Ted had asked of him.
As he moved through the house, Michael found himself impressed with the care and attention that Ted had put into the house.
Everything from junk mail to used ashtrays had their particular place in the house.
A mahogany four-post bed sat in the middle of the bedroom, still made up from the morning prior.
Michael dropped to the floor and looked underneath the bed, finding the box that Ted had mentioned in the note.
He pulled the box out from underneath the bed and brought it out to the porch.
Michael sat down in his chair, still making sure that Ted's was available.
He opened the box and started to dig through the various items, which reminded Michael of some sort of collection box.
It seemed everything that Ted felt was even of minor importance was kept in here.
A birth certificate from the late forties, a social security card and a few old newspaper clippings that had announced the birth of Theodore Emmanual Shepler.
Underneath those, Michael found pictures of Ted on his wedding day, along with a collection of cards that he had received from his wife over the years.
As he read the wedding announcement and looked at the pictures, Michael realized that he wasn't ever as happy as Ted appeared in those pictures.
In every picture that he and Renee took together, he managed to look completely miserable, without even trying to.
Nobody had ever mentioned it to him, though.
They just looked at it as though that was Michael being Michael.
Thinking back, he pondered how different his life would have been if he had never met Renee.
Would he have met Theresa?
Or would it just be another missed connection?
He threw everything back into the box and closed it, setting it down in Ted's chair and staring out into the street.
What now?
Everything that he considered close and important to him was ripped away.
Throughout the night, he smoked one cigarette after the other and drank an entire pitcher of tea.
When there was one cigarette left and about half a glass of tea, he lifted the glass in one hand and the cigarette in the other, "This is for you, Ted," He paused and smiled, raising the cigarette higher, "Here's to you, Renee.
Here's to you, John.
Here's to you, Beatrice.
Here's to all of you and the rest of the people that I have lost in this crazy thing called life."
He drained the glass in one gulp and put the cigarette in his mouth, smiling from underneath.
Tonight, he would sleep in Ted's bed.
It seemed only right.
Ted wanted him to have this house, rather than Beatrice's old house, but he never came out and said it.
Michael could feel it, though.
Ted wanted Michael to succeed at everything he did, no matter what that was.
The undying support of a man who happened to be the neighbor of his mother-in-law was nothing less than amazing to Michael.
Ted managed to take him under his wing and teach him the ways of being a real man.
As the cigarette burned, a pain began to press down on Michael's chest.
He could feel his heart beginning to race and the pain began to travel through his body, up to his shoulder and down his left arm.
He struggled to take a breath, staring out into the street and understand what was happening to him.
This was the most incredibly horrible pain of his life.
It felt as though there were knives being stabbed into him and there was a rhinoceros firmly planted on his sternum.
Michael tried to take another puff off of his cigarette.
The glass fell off of his leg and dropped on the top of his foot.
The light amber mixture of tea and water covered his foot, the ice cubes skittering across the porch.
Seconds later, Michael couldn't hold onto his cigarette any longer.
He dropped it to the floor and the tea and water mixture extinguished it almost immediately.
He clutched his chest, struggling to take another breath, but found it impossible.
Michael looked around, hoping there was a neighbor who was out for a late night stroll.
A person looking for a dog that had escaped their backyard.
Two teenagers looking for a make out point.
Something.
But, there was nobody.
Michael was completely alone and was dying a slow, painful death.
His eyes grew dark and instead of ignoring the pain, as he had in the past, he finally accepted what was happening to him.
A smile crossed his lips and he leaned back in the chair, trying to relax and letting his arms fall to the side.
Now, he understood what Ted was talking about when someone finally accepted death and stopped being afraid of it.
The pain melted away.
Fear no longer meant anything.
Michael looked out through the screen door and could see someone waving their arms and running towards the porch.
Michael struggled to lift an arm, but couldn't manage, instead choosing to sit there.
Before the person reached the door, Michael felt the last breath leave his body.
After that, there was nothing but the sweet silence of death.
CHAPTER 13
Michael looked down at himself, trying to figure out exactly what just happened.
There was nothing.
There was no pain.
There was no hatred.
There was no anger.
The only thing that he felt was a sense of melancholy that draped over him, sitting at his body sitting in the chair on the porch.
There was someone trying to open the screen door to the porch, but just as the person started to come into view, Michael felt himself rise through the air.
A few seconds later, he found himself standing in a long hallway with a light shining from the end of it.
A sexless voice echoed in his head, calling him forward to the light.
After he took a step, a familiar hand fell on his shoulder.
He spun around and when he saw Ted standing there, he felt a true menagerie of emotions flow through him.
Sadness.
Pity.
Anger.
But, they all dissipated and the only thing that Michael felt was happiness.
Ted smiled and opened his mouth as though he were speaking, but Michael could hear no voice coming from him.
Instead, he heard Ted's voice filling his mind.
The soft voice of the older, more experienced and knowledgeable generation filled his head, "Michael.
We have been watching you from above.
It is time to spend some time here and fulfill the destiny that has been laid out for you," Michael raised an eyebrow, cocking his head to the side and trying to decipher exactly what Ted was trying to say.
Ted shook his head and extended his arms, his voice filling Michael's head once again, "Give this old man a hug and everything will be revealed."
Michael looked over Ted's shoulder, but saw nothing.
His brain, however, told him that the best decision was to do what the old man said.
He clasped his hands around his former neighbor's back, pulling Ted's body against his own.
The feeling of closure came over him.
He knew that no matter what happened from this point forward in his life, he couldn't blame Ted for anything.
Ted leaned back and looked at him, a smile teasing on the corners of his lips, "Good job, son.
There's a couple of people behind me that also want to talk to you," A tear rolled down the side of his cheek, "I also want to thank you for everything you taught me, Michael.
