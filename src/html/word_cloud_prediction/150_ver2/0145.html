The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they\'re expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context.   \'The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy .\' \'I \'m sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand .\' \'I thought, like, maybe you would know .\' \'My father was something of a dilettante .\' \'He rather doubts you\'ll be able to convince your mom. \' \'\' Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:  \'Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side .\' \'\' There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following:  \'When a standard vaccuum can\'t even pick up the clods, you know you\'ve kinda got a problem.\' \'\' Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., "a tad", "a little", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number ("a little whiskey", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average ("a mite stupid", "somewhat confused" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category ("something of a klutz"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition ("I, like, waved it around").  In both cases, the Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting.'}, {'frame': 'Morality_evaluation', 'tfidf': 0.530470966951093, 'lexical_unit': 'base.a / bad.a / upstanding.a', 'definition': "In this frame an Evaluee is described by a (usually implicit) Judge with respect to the morality or rightness of his or her Behavior.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Isabelle scrunches up her nose.
"What's that?"
"Shepherd's pie sounds like a dessert, but it's not.
Ground beef is slopped together with peas, corn, and gravy, buried under a mashed potato blanket.
Nothing like a pie."
Isabelle's house is squeaky clean and a bit haunted house-ish.
The chandeliers glow dim.
The gold brocade draperies are closed.
Soft velvet cushions cover her couch and ornate statues guard the corners.
Perfect for a ghost story.
Her tidy home with deep cherry wood furniture smells of lemon.
Usually her mom stays home and cooks or rests on the couch watching soap operas unless she's out shopping.
Her dad works late, and Joey is at football practice.
Isabelle and I rattle her house when we walk through the doors.
We head straight to the TV in the den.
Isabelle introduced me to Asteroids, now my favorite video game, and I'm hooked.
I love sending my mind into outer space to destroy incoming meteors as if I could save the world.
Sometimes, like today, Isabelle tries to bribe me to stop playing.
"I'll make you a vanilla milkshake if you shut off the game."
I give in for ice cream.
While slurping the last of the shake, Isabelle surprises me with a question.
"What will you do when Randi gets out of the hospital?
Will you hang out with her or me?"
The truth pops out of my mouth before I can stop it.
"I'll have to see her sometimes."
Isabelle frowns, so I back pedal.
"Maybe I can see her every other day--go back and forth playing with both of you.
Unless you want to come with me to her house."
"I don't like Randi.
I mean, not that I don't like her.
It's just she's strange, and I wouldn't want to hang out with her.
You have to make a choice between us."
Isabelle turns her back to me.
Is she crying?
What I want to say is: You don't even know her.
She's not weird.
She's nicer than you!
But the words stay locked in my mind.
I still have a couple of weeks before I have to deal with the problem of choosing friends.
How will I tell Isabelle that I want to see Randi because she is still my best friend?
I don't want Isabelle to hate me either.
Being in the middle is the worst.
On Mondays, Isabelle stays after school for band practice, so I choose a bus seat in the first row, next to Kimmy, a girl in Randi's class.
Before the bus even starts to move, Kimmy starts talking, barely takes a breath, and I regret my seat choice.
Kimmy is like a fly buzzing in my ear.
I have a strong urge to swat her.
"Have you seen Randi in the hospital yet?
Our class decorated a giant card for her.
Do you know how she's doing?"
"I went to visit her a month ago."
For the first time, Kimmy is quiet.
"She looked terrible.
She had no hair and looked so skinny since she's been losing weight.
And can you believe she only weighs forty pounds now?"
I add, hoping to shock her with my news.
"That's not so skinny," Kimmy retorts.
"I weigh forty pounds too."
Her comment irritates me, and I'm glad she gets off at the next stop.
Why did I answer Kimmy and gossip about Randi like I was handing out the latest newspaper for anyone to read?
What if Michael had heard us?
I would've felt horrible.
Good thing his mom picked him up today.
I kick the door open and drop my backpack on the floor.
"You okay?
Come help me bake a cake," Mom calls from the kitchen.
"And you can lick the beaters."
"What's the cake for?"
"Oh, I just felt like cooking something sweet for my sweetie."
I try not to cringe.
"How was school today?"
"Okay, I guess.
I got a 93 on my math test."
That's all I tell her.
"That's wonderful, honey.
I'm so proud of you."
She wouldn't be so proud if she knew how I gossiped about Randi today.
I wonder if Randi has a hidden side.
The only flaw I can see in Randi is the one she can't help.
As we sit down for dinner, Mom can't contain her secret any longer.
"Guess what I heard this afternoon?"
She doesn't wait for us to guess.
"Randi's coming home tomorrow, just in time for her birthday.
You girls are invited to her party on Saturday.
Mrs.
Picconi said it will be a casual party, just family and her closest friends over for deli sandwiches and cake.
That gives us two days to find a special gift."
"Wow, that's great!"
I should be excited.
And I am...I think.
But now I have to decide: But now I have to decide: how can I be loyal to my old friend and keep my new friend?
Someone's going to be mad at me--I'm sure.
Randi has been in the hospital for almost two months, and I'm used to life without her.
That sounds cruel, but it happened.
Tomorrow, she comes home.
How do I rewind my life and go back to the way it was?
Chapter 9
I don't like April weather.
It's too confusing.
Cloudy, sunny, breezy, rainy, warm in the sunshine, cool in the shade, hot wearing long sleeves, cold wearing short sleeves.
The breeze gives me goose bumps when I take off my sweater.
When I put it back on, I sweat.
Just as the weather can't seem to make up its mind, I'm having trouble deciding what to wear today.
If I wear a dress to Randi's party, I might be chilly or overdressed.
But my pants are all ugly, old, or ripped.
What about color and comfort?
White might get stained.
Some shirts have scratchy tags.
Whatever I choose--I'm not ready for today.
"What time is it?"
I wait for Dad to lift his face from the Agatha Christie mystery novel.
"Well, let's see.
It's five minutes later than the time I just told you.
It's 1:30."
He rests his book on the corner of the oak coffee table that Laurie decorated with permanent red marker lines at age two.
"Why don't you sign the card and we'll go over to the party in about twenty minutes.
It will come sooner if you stop watching the clock or stop making me watch the clock."
Dad returns to his book and I return to clock watching and tracing the red lines with my finger.
I haven't been in Randi's house for two months--since the day before her operation.
Now things are different, more than just her looks.
I doubt she knows I've been playing with Isabelle almost every day while she was in the hospital, unless her mother noticed and told her.
This is the first time I'm keeping a secret from Randi.
I'm not about to mention Isabelle today, her first week back.
I'll just keep my mouth shut.
Michael greets us at the door, blowing a party horn, and wearing a pointy, red party hat.
Pink and purple streamers drape across corners.
Matching balloons dance around every room.
In addition to the Happy Birthday sign is a Welcome Home sign hanging at the entrance to the kitchen.
Billy Joel songs fill Randi's house with a familiar sound.
Is everything going to be back to normal soon?
Can we play together like we used to?
Am I still her best friend?
Is she still my best friend?
I look around for Randi, clutching her present to my chest.
Mrs.
Picconi takes Mom's hand.
"I'm so glad you came.
It means a lot to Randi."
I hope Mom doesn't say something to make Mrs. Picconi cry.
Remember, Mom, it's supposed to be a party.
"We're just thrilled that Randi's home.
Francie has been counting the days."
Yes, I guess I have.
But not for the reason Mom thinks.
"Come in. Help yourselves to sandwiches in the kitchen.
You remember my parents and my brother Joe and his wife, Barbara."
As I'm peering into the other room, Mrs. Picconi puts her arm around my shoulders.
"Randi will be down soon.
She's feeling nauseous today."
Then she calls Michael over.
"I'd like you to hand out the hats and horns to all the kids and have them wait at the bottom of the stairs.
