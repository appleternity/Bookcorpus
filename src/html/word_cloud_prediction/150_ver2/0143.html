Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Scrutiny', 'tfidf': 0.5393626934621988, 'lexical_unit': 'ransack.v / eyeball.v / explore.v', 'definition': "This frame concerns a Cognizer (a person or other intelligent being) paying close attention to something, the Ground, in order to discover and note its salient characteristics.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.

Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

she asked quietly but didn't turn to face him or even lift her head from the downcast position she had assumed.
"No, can you talk to me a while?"
"I guess" she said reluctantly but didn't move to sit down "You can sit down."
Nick gestured to the chair She sat down, but didn't say anything.
"Lindsay, is something wrong?"
She shook her head "Lindsay, this isn't like you.
What is it?"
"Nothing important."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
"I have to get back to work."
She said as she stood to run from the room.
"Thank you Lindsay.
I appreciate you bringing my lunch."
He said momentarily halting her flight.
She mumbled a you are welcome and left.
Nick was stunned.
She didn't even ask how I was or anything.
She didn't even look at me.
I have been home for days and she hasn't come by and now this.
What is wrong?
He wondered.
Nick ate his lunch thinking about Lindsay.
She was so special to him only she didn't know it.
He had known her most of their lives but in the last few months his feelings for her had changed.
She was becoming so important to his happiness, now how to get her to see that.
Nick fell asleep and dreamed of Lindsay dancing with him.
Riding with him and loving him forever.
Lindsay however was rushing to her room to have a good cry.
She had to take some time off and soon.
Nick would be up and around soon and she needed to be gone.
Nick's bed rest period had been over for about a week now and he was getting around on his walking cast.
He couldn't do much work but he was glad to be up.
Nick walked up the main house for dinner.
He greeted his mama and she asked him to go get Lindsay for dinner.
As he walked to the hallway, she came out of her office and stopped.
"I was just sent to get you" Nick called as she paused.
"Dinner's ready."
"Thanks but I am not hungry.
I was just going to tell Gabby not to expect me.
Would you tell her for me?"
"I can.
You haven't eaten dinner with us in days.
You sick?"
"No, just not hungry.
Excuse me."
She said without looking at him and walked to her room.
She walked away from me again.
I can't believe this.
Nick thought as he returned to the dining room.
"Where's Lindsay?"
asked Gabby "She said she wasn't hungry."
Nick answered "Again?"
questioned Dalton "Is there something wrong with her?"
Everyone shrugged and started eating.
Sarah was concerned for her friend.
Lindsay wasn't eating or talking to anyone and it was time for a heart to heart.
Sarah finished eating and went to find Lindsay.
She knocked on her door but there was no answer.
She went back to the table and sat down again.
"Well?"
asked Dalton "She didn't answer the door so I don't know where she is.
I will talk to her later.
Let's head home."
David was relaxing in his room when there was a knock at his door.
"Come in" "David, can I talk to you?"
"Sure, sit down."
Lindsay sat on one of the chairs in the sitting area and tried to think of the best way to start this conversation.
"Lindsay, what's wrong?"
Lindsay took a fortifying breath "I am resigning from ranch manager and moving away.
I don't want to work or live here anymore.
You will have to hire someone to manage the ranch business."
"NO!"
David shouted.
Lindsay was glad it was just the two of them in the house.
His shout would have brought the whole house to see what was wrong and she didn't want anyone to know she was leaving.
"I wasn't asking your permission.
I'm telling you."
"The answer is the same.
No."
"Please David, this is very important to me."
"NO, but I want to know why you mentioned it."
"It is personal."
"And I am your brother so tell me."
"I can't."
she replied softly "The answer is no.
You are my sister; you will live and work here."
"David, I really need some time away."
"Then take a short vacation."
"How about a month and I will take my work with me?"
"What is this all about?
And why a month?"
"Please trust me David; I need to be away from here."
"Ok, but if I think it isn't working I want you to come home."
"Thanks.
I will make it work."
Lindsay said "Lindsay, I wish you would tell me what is wrong."
"I can't."
Lindsay gave him a sweet smile "Please have faith in me."
"I do."
"Thanks.
I love you David.
I'll see you in a month."
"I love you too Lindsay."
Chapter 4
Lindsay had enjoyed her first day away from home.
She had accomplished more work in a few short hours than she had in weeks at home.
David hadn't been thrilled with her leaving but finally gave in.
"But only if you can still do business away from home."
She hadn't told Dalton that she was leaving.
An email had been sent to Sarah explaining that she would be away for a month but to call or email her sometimes.
Sarah wrote back immediately wanting an explanation.
Lindsay wrote back "I need a long vacation."
She knew Sarah wasn't going to accept that explanation but it was all she was going to get from Lindsay.
Whether or not David chose to tell them what she had originally requested was up to him.
The next morning Lindsay woke refreshed and feeling better than she had in months.
She was going to the gym and then to spend the day at the spa.
She loved being one of the owners of this hotel.
She got dressed and left her room.
As she waited for the elevator, the door to the other suite opened.
She turned to see who Dalton had let stay in his suite and found herself looking at Nick Cates.
"What are you doing here?"
they each asked at the same time Lindsay responded "I am on vacation for a while."
"Me too" Nick agreed No, this can't be.
I left because of you!
Lindsay groaned silently.
Thankfully the elevator arrived and she got in hoping he wouldn't join her but he did.
She pushed the button for the floor for the spa and he pushed the button for the dining room.
She didn't speak or look at him.
"Lindsay?"
Nick cleared his throat "Do you want to have breakfast with me?"
"I can't.
I have an appointment at the spa."
"How about dinner?"
he tried again "Maybe, I have a table in the steakhouse at seven.
If you want to come, just tell them to seat you at the table."
"I'll be there."
Nick said as they reached the spa and she stepped off.
She waved back at him to acknowledge that she heard him.
Lindsay walked quickly to the gym to work off the stress she had acquired in that short elevator ride.
I must have the worst luck.
Who else would leave home and the problem follow her on vacation?
She went back to exercising and then went to the spa for her massage.
Lindsay saw that Nick was already seated at the table when she arrived.
The hostess gave him a sly smile of welcome as she seated Lindsay.
"Hi."
She said as she sat down "Hello.
You look nice."
"Thank you."
Lindsay replied and moved to look at the menu as the waitress approached.
They gave their dinner orders and tried to think of something to say to break the silence.
