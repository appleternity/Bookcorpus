Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Paddle hard!"
he screams out, although Topher can't hear him.
"Get up!
Get up!
Get the fuck up, Topher!"
Miles yells.
He must've seen the competition official in his peripherals because he throws his arms out in apology.
"Sorry dude!"
But it makes Vin crack a smile and that earns Miles a few more points in my book.
All eyes are back on Topher, who has popped up and is riding the wave flawlessly into shore.
He paddles back out for the next wave, but Kale announces ever-so-loudly that he knows Topher's moving on to the next round with that wave, especially when his competitor sucks.
An hour of California sunshine later, Vin turns his back on the ocean because he can't bring himself to watch the final heat.
We've abandoned the tailgate to stand with the Hooligans.
I soak up every bit of warmth from this moment because I don't know what next summer holds, and I don't know if all of us will ever be together in a single moment again.
I know Linzi won't be back here with me, attached to Alston's hip, and I don't know where the world will take Miles if he wins the sponsorship.
Kale could go back to Hawaii.
A.J. could get thrown in county for something dumb.
Or the ocean could take someone away.
I shake that last thought out of my mind as Topher paddles out.
The waves crash around him and over him, sloshing him back and forth, but he keeps going, fighting harder each time to reach the big set that's rolling in.
"He's going to take it," Jace says, craning his neck to see that far out.
"It's fucking beautiful," Miles says in an almost whisper.
He's right.
Everything about that wave is beautiful, and I'm not even looking at it from a surfer's viewpoint.
It's a glaze of all shades of blue, and it feels so right for Topher to be the one about to ride it.
The whitecaps stretch out behind him, hovering and waiting to make sure he's safely onboard.
The sun glints off the water creating a glow of ocean and sky with Topher Brooks right in the center of it all.
There's nothing amateur about the way he rides.
The waiting period for the judges to tally the scores feels like hours rather than minutes.
Topher paces the sand in this stressed out kind of frenzy, a habit he's inherited from his brother.
Vin hasn't said a word either, but I know he's hoping that Topher has the highest numbers - just because it means that much to Topher.
I latch onto A.J.'s arm to brace myself once the announcer asks everyone to gather around for scores.
Aside from the competitors and their supporters, the amateur section is pretty dead.
Even this emptiness makes me happy, just seeing who all really cares about their amateur surfers.
Of course there's one Hooligan who didn't bother to show.
But as far as I'm concerned, he's not one of them - and Kale is.
As third best ride and then second best is announced, my heart races and I hear it pounding even with the roaring ocean behind me. A.J. squeezes my hand, and I hold my breath.
"And with an average score of 8.5, today's best ride - and winner of the amateur division title - is Topher Brooks!"
A.J. wraps me up in an anaconda-grip kind of hug, and although I'd give anything to see the look on Vin's face upon hearing Topher's name, I don't fight my best friend.
Instead, I squeeze him back, breathe in the smell of cigarette smoke from his shirt, and savor every single second of this moment.
Miles screams out, "Hell yes!"
too many times to count, and Reed announces, "Celebration at my place!"
I glance around to see where Vin is, and I spot him easily.
He's wrapped up in a moment with the kid who's drinking Ocean Blast Energy like it's a gift from Kanaloa.
I wish Shark was here to capture it.
Chapter Twenty-Three The scent of charcoal fills the guest house as Reed fires up the grill out back.
I'm ready for next summer for Reed's cooking alone.
Strick is quite the housewife, even though he'd kill me and Alston both if he knew we said that behind his back.
Linzi makes more noise than necessary packing her things in the room next to me.
I think she's mad, partially at me for not telling her about Vin, and partially because she doesn't want to leave.
I just hope she gets it all out of her system before the cross-country drive home with her.
My heart crumbles just a little as I take Zombie Asylum down from the shelf and pack them into my suitcase.
I sniffle and blink my eyes a few times to keep from letting the tears fall.
I'll do enough of that later on.
"Hey," Linzi says from my doorway.
"Do you have anything I can wrap Sofia in?
I don't want her to get broken on the drive back."
She holds Sofia up, and the bedroom light catches her just perfectly.
Streaks of purple bounce off my walls, and now I can't help letting the tears fall.
"Damn it," I say, sitting back on the bed.
My bay window is lonely.
"I left Solomon at Colby freaking Taylor's house."
And I hate myself for it.
"We'll get him back," Linzi says.
She comes inside the room and sits down next to me.
"Any of the guys can get him.
Hell, I'll go out there and get him right now.
I'm not scared of Colby Taylor.
We have leverage on him."
I laugh.
Yes, we do.
But we're not sinking to his level.
I wipe the tears away and find the plastic bags our suncatchers came in and give them to Linzi for Sofia.
"You know what?
I'll be okay.
Solomon was the one thing that was constant on the Spence Burks-Colby Taylor search, and I found all my answers.
I found everything I needed.
Surfer boy needs Solomon's light more than I do now."
"So we're leaving him?"
Linzi asks.
"Yeah," I say nodding.
I imagine him hanging there, sparkling blue, next to all those jars of paper stars and the drumsticks.
He's surrounded by Shark's photography, surfboards, and Dexter.
"He's in good company," I say more to reassure myself than Linzi.
After dinner, Miles pops open a can of beer and chugs some of it, then raises it in the air.
"Toast!"
he yells out.
"To my boy, Topher - for his win today and for being the badass surfer that he is."
Topher holds up his hand to stop him.
Then he raises his bottle of Ocean Blast Energy.
"No, this one is for Shark McAllister, who taught me how to surf.
And to my brother Vin, who taught me everything else."
"Hell yeah!"
Kale says.
He stands up and raises his beer can.
"To all of you - for making me a part of your jacked up Hooligan family."
I wait just a second to make sure no one else is going to interrupt before I clink my Dr. Pepper can against Linzi's.
Like Kale, I feel so insanely blessed to be here with this jacked up Hooligan family, to be surrounded by people who see the best in each other and don't take a second of their time together for granted.
The party moves outside, but I know the night's winding down.
All of my things are packed.
There'll be no sleeping in the guest house tonight.
I won't be able to sleep period knowing what I'm leaving behind here.
I grab Reed's Strickland's Boating hoodie off the couch inside and walk down to the shoreline to watch the waves roll in one last time before the sun officially sets.
"Are you gonna miss it?"
Topher hollers out from behind me.
I glance over my shoulder to see him coming toward the shoreline.
Miles and Kale are a few feet behind him.
"Miss what exactly?"
I ask once he's beside me.
He nods toward the water.
"The ocean.
The cove.
California."
"Not as much as I'll miss the people here."
Kale snatches my cell phone from me, and Miles watches the ocean like he's contemplating the meaning of life.
He's fascinating, like the ocean in a way.
One moment he's pulling thoughts from the deepest depths and the next he's raising a beer can and screaming like a Hooligan.
"In case things don't work out with you and Brooks," Kale says, "I saved my number in there.
And you know, if it does work out, you can still text me and get the lowdown on the Island parties."
I tuck my phone back into my back pocket and hug him.
Someday he's going to make some crazy surfer girl really happy.
He says that he's going to send a special prayer up for a safe trip home?and back next summer.
He ascends the hill back to the house and disappears behind the privacy fence.
"I guess we're going to go," Miles says.
"Topher, you riding back?"
Topher shakes his head.
"Nah, I think big brother needs me more tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow, though."
Tomorrow.
The competition.
I wish I could spare one more day to watch Miles kick Dominic's ass.
"You're going to kill it tomorrow," I say.
"I wish I could see it, but I already know you will.
Good luck?and an early congrats."
Miles laughs.
"Don't congratulate me yet.
You never know what can happen out there."
But I do know.
I know that Miles will dominate because his heart is in it.
He gets it - real deal surfing.
He knows what it's about at the core.
He's not in it for the glory.
"I'll congratulate you again tomorrow then.
I'll be on the phone with A.J. getting play by play," I say.
"Well, in that case," Miles says, "after they call out my name and I pry Topher off of me, I'll find A.J. and holler at you."
He hugs me, waves a shaka at Topher, and moments later, his truck rumbles in the driveway and into the night.
Two Hooligans down and I already want to cry.
Topher crams my last bit of stuff into the trunk and, by some miracle, actually gets the thing to close.
He lingers around my car in that awkward way that his brother does, like there's a million things running through his mind, and he can't decide which to say or if he should speak at all.
"I don't like goodbyes," he finally says.
