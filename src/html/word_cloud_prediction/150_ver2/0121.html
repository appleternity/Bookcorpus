Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.' 'Everyone stood as Captain Jack Aubrey delivered a toast.' 'Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is sticking to his guns .'

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

In the extended sense of living things in general colonizing or settling a new area, the original Homeland must still inhabited by some of the same group. In this sense Colonization is distinct from migration or exodus.  'In the 7th century BC, Phoenicians colonized the eastern section of Libya.' 'In the 7th century BC, Phoenicians colonized the eastern section of Libya.'

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.

"*Come with me*" She responded With the tone Of an underlying question "*And we will ...*"
"No" I interrupted "Our relationship Has nothing to gain"
I turned  And walked Down the path
I wasn't angry Really, But I felt That nothing Could be gained From the information of silence-- Not friendship Nor happiness Nor love Nor the light Of the rising sun "So, It is best That we part" I thought
And with clinging feet I clung And over hills and over hills All alone again I traveled
"On with the fields of wheat And I shall sow this garden And see what grows Before I track the desert again
Path of rolling hills Of indifference Sowing the garden as I go Now is the time of the prophecies-- Take me to my sun What matters?
Let me reap the light"
My confidence was high As I walked along
Above The sky was blue And dotted with white clouds Birds flew Circling above and Sailing over Little animals That scampered in the fields of wheat
The sun was warm
I thought again Of the desert prophet-- Long white hair And brown wrinkled skin An old, old man Near the gates of death Yet a man of wisdom With an inner eye To see the paths Of the future
The desert peoples Traveled thousands of miles To obtain his advice They would listen to his prophecies His philosophies His teachings of life
Some would find sadness, Others gladness
They would lay gifts At his feet In appreciation; They knew that his were the words Of truth
"Yes" I thought "Words of truth Telling me of a garden-- This garden Yielding The light of the rising sun"
In anticipation Perhaps eagerness I continued To trail
The day was slow In passing As I thought About the sun The prophet The lady Wild beasts and jungle The desert And other gardens--
"And now The path in front-- To what future Of reality Does it lead?"
Like a snake The path continued Winding Easy And slow As it moved A Westerly route Through the hills
Another day Through the night The morning A few hours more, Coiling the hills And then- Swaying, waving Becoming sparse Rolling from sight The sea of wheat Was gone
Flattening out The hills were leveling
Up ahead A path crossed mine I passed it by
After walking Nearly half a day Finally Looking ahead The hills were gone
A plain plain planed
A vision of miles and miles and miles The underside of flat For miles and miles and miles
I continued on For several days Searching
The weather had changed No clouds in the sky No wind Not a breeze Not even an occasional gust
I looked ahead, Watching-- Another path crossed mine
Upon the clinging path I passed it by The heat was stifling If only for a breeze
Furthering distance Another day Ahead again A path crossed mine
The sweating heat Burning Burning feet
Another path crossed mine
"Paths-- Tracking  And trailing the worlds Like feet in the sand Traveling Seeking a goal
Each time I pass a path I wonder 'Where Does it travel?
And How would my life be changed If I took this path Instead of that?
Indeed How would it be If I could travel All the paths Live all the lives Track all the tracks?'"
Several more crossed At different angles And I passed them by
"If I had infinite feet, Then would mine Be the knowledge of God-- Omniscient"
Through that day And through that night The sweating hot night Furthering on Sleep and walk To the dawn I went
The breaking of day Broke To break the will The rising sun Shone through The beginning light Spread Accompanied by birds (but not that day) The cloudless sky Blue and pink combining Providing light Dimly seen Vaguely outlined Gradually The beginning day I looked about As the light intensed
I stopped in amazement "Hundreds Thousands No-- Countless Obscurity" I looked behind be "Where is the path I have walked?--
Lost in the maze"
Paths crossing paths crossing paths But where was mine?
"From whence did I come?
And Whither shall I go?"
There was no way to tell Which way Was the way
Crossing Crisscrossing paths Countless on barren land In all directions Away Surpassing the horizon
Treeless Plantless Rockless ground Not even was the desert so barren
I moved on-- What else?
"Finding the sun Will be just as easy here As any other place, But the heat Is stifling"
As the sun broiled down I wandered aimless through the maze of paths It was my hope To come, eventually, to the perimeter Of that Hades Kingdom-- "I will follow the path Of the sun" I thought
"The end of this Confusion Will come" I wiped the sweat From my eyes And continued on
A day passed And still The paths were countless On barren land
Still Another day Passed As I followed the sun In the field of paths Stepping lower Slower Pushing through the waves of heat Almost dragging Stumbling upon the barren ground
I paused For a moment Straining my eyes Searching ahead
I thought I saw something Standing In the distance
"Is it a mirage?"
I wondered
Closer Draggingly closer
"My eyes are undeceiving, It is not a mirage But a figure-- How to figure a figure Out here It is"
I wondered who it was "She possibly knows The way out But possibly stranded Too" Approachingly closer Hoping
My imagination Began to take over "Is it a woman?
Do I see a dress?"
Lifting my feet Through the heat Upon the plain of paths
I moved quicker Closer Dismayingly closer
"Wet sweat Sweet sweat Toiling In the boiling heat And all for naught
Not a woman But a pole-- Tall And wooden
"Why a pole In the middle  Of a maze?"
Carefully I scrutinized, Observing
Upon And around the pole There appeared to be Bloodstains
Sweat dripped from my nose As I looked At the pole
I sat on the ground Leaning my back against 'The empty door' Jutting itself insidiously From the trailing maze
"Two days And no water--" I thought As I watched The sweat drip
I was lacking Energy-- Too tired To wipe away My life's blood
"Perhaps The old prophet Saw into death-- Maybe I shall find The light Through the infinite darkness Of my eyes"
I reached up And unbuttoned My sweat soaking robe
My hand Flopped again Down  To the ground
I sat And waited-- For what?
Perhaps To regain Energy
Perhaps For the sun To go down
Still I sat--
Sitting Waiting Suffocating Drowsing Tiring ...
And then I saw it--
At first Merely a haze, Coming closer Through the night
I peered I strained For the sense Of it
"Come closer And Let me see"
Gradually The form Takes shape--
Elegance And radiance In the rain
I call to her,
But then She turns-- Movement in white Graceful strides
The flowing silk The moonlit hair Running through the rain Away Far away
How beautiful The falling rain How beautiful But oh the sadness The blinding blinding rain
It has come It has drowned the light And the sight of your soul is gone
To see you again Through the dark The rain
Come Come back again Come, let us be together Love together Write together
Yes Let us bend quills together
Let it flow Free and rhyme Fiction and prose And to the world The drowning world The bending river shows
But ah the sadness Reality: You are gone
Oh my God My God My Man My Greatness My God You are gone And the rain is warm
Warmer It is hot Running hot It is ...
Suddenly tense I awoke Wet sweat Running warmly Dripped from my nose
Wiping the salt tears From my face I looked to the trailing maze
Leaning forward I put a hand on the ground, Again The other wiped away water That stings the eyes
Was I still dreaming?
I looked
No I was awake And they were really there Standing in front of me
Tall Broad Proud Men and women Such big people
Rings Bracelets Necklaces Spears and knives Scalps on belts Such little people But where did they come from Upon this maze Of paths?
There were close to fifty of them (Including children) Most were expressing grins Of invidious plenitude And many seemed excitedly anxious Anxiously waiting
"Who are you?"
I asked
But they didn't, Couldn't Answer, Instead They conversed in a strange language One I had never before heard It was guttural and primitive
I thought "Perhaps they will help me" (But somehow I didn't think so) "Just a palm of water, Of life And A finger Pointing the way away From this maze" I thought
Suddenly they stopped talking And two white men and a yellow Came cautiously Forward Toward
In moments And a brief struggle They had me bound to the pole; Binding with rawhide And tearing the skin that covered my wrists; The rawhide soaked blood
They began to dance In a circle Around myself and the pole
Singing Jumping and chanting Running Yelling Spinning and rolling
Such strange people Skins of all colors
A large white man Tore a hole With his spear And ripped away my clothes-- God But for a breeze
All Then Became quiet But for the large white man-- Yelling and shouting And jumping magnificently high He danced a dance of epilepsy
Rippling muscles surged Taut to the bone Dancing to a rhythm Rippling Quivering Quaking Bulging And relaxing For others to bulge
He continued to dance While the others watched They edged to the front of the crowd Getting better positions--some sitting, And little children peered between legs--
And the white man continued, He danced for the sky Face upward Jumping Twisting Jumping Chanting Continuing
Finally He finished-- A violent finish Bearing down on me With beady eyes Twisting and turning Showing his Teeth And yelling to the heavens Heaving his spear Up and down Sweat rolling from his body Such a big man
Up and down Up and down
Such a splendid spear Beaming reflections Reflecting Bright light From the hot, cold steel point
Such a skillful spear Accurate Deft
Such a violent finish With a skillful spear He wounded my side
The spear parted skin Easily Being sharp Slicing bowels And puncturing organs-- The spear rended And withdrew
The anguish and blood Tearing my brain Borning my death When the morning Was gone My eyes Would grow dark With the night
Ah the anguish, But the warm blood Was cool Running on burning skin In the heat Of the day
They all rose, Again he danced This time, Time A longer dance Perhaps waiting For the morning to pass
But Forthwith He drew a knife Glinting And came toward He placed it to my throat And drawing to create A new passage-- Blood
As I looked at him I thought In anguish "Merely a movement A mere move of his arm To send away From this body Forever-- A mere merely For forever A mere merely To destroy A total world"
And so, So quick There it was-- The end How should I have felt So close To my goal?
How unfeeling My shaded end To end And begin over again
"Time has turned My wheel of life" I thought In the moment Before death "And I have traveled Many roads-- All leading To the same goal, Bringing me closer
But now It will end-- A slip backward, A delay In progress Only to begin again"
I waited For the final pull The slicing Of my throat The gushing Of blood And the feeling Of horror The moment before death I followed his eyes As he began To draw the blade-- But he was no longer Looking at me Instead He was gazing Behind
And His smile downed To a wrinkling frown And stepping back Carefully With Withdrawing the blade
Concerning He stared behind me Backing further, Back to his people They all stared
Still I waited, The dance The knife The end
My body waited The eternal wait The dead weight My soul would be free
Together They huddled closer The leader Thrusting forth his spear As if A protecting threat
"Finish your ceremony" I said
I waited--
Nothing happened, Truly A strange ceremony
I was feeling faint The blood continued From the rend In my side
Still They stared Watching perhaps Until death came From bleeding
