For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Kristina took the device and gave the woman a small smile.
"I guess that makes sense.
It's very kind that you do that."
She shrugged and her face fell.
"It is mercy," she said quietly.
"There is too much need for it here."
Kristina gave her another nod and left without a word.
The warm summer air enveloped her and warmed up her skin, which she only now realized had gotten cold in the air-conditioned store.
She clutched her new device to her chest.
Maybe she could find a place still open to grab a bite to eat before she went back to Tatum's hideaway.
She turned to the trio of men watching the ad on the building's wall, but they hadn't moved.
Nor would they the whole night, she figured.
Probably best not to ask them what was open.
Footsteps rushed behind her, approaching rapidly.
Her heart raced and she froze, torn whether to bolt back into the store or run down the street.
Instead, she dropped the box containing her newly purchased comm device on the ground and spun to face her attacker, fists clenched.
Tatum came to a stop just two feet in front of her, eyes opened wide.
He still wore the fitted navy t-shirt she'd seen when he was on the couch, his hard chest rising and falling with each breath.
In the light now she saw his five o'clock shadow had come in thick, and his hair had pressed up to one side of his head as evidence of sleeping.
"There you are," he gasped.
"I thought you'd gone."
She let her fists loosen by her sides.
"You scared the hell out of me."
"You scared the hell out of me!"
He stepped forward.
"Leaving without telling me?
Before we've even talked?
What were you thinking?"
Blood rushed to her face.
"I was coming back," she said.
She dug into her pocket and held up the key she had stolen minutes earlier.
"Obviously, seeing as I have this."
She looked down at her newly purchased comm device.
The box was dented, but it looked not too much the worse for wear.
She bent down and picked it up, clutching the device to her chest again.
"I just needed to buy a comm to call my brother and let him know I'm alive."
"You should have woken me up," he said, though his breathing had slowed down.
"I shouldn't have fallen asleep, but you should have woken me up."
"I was only going to be gone twenty minutes.
Hardly worth you getting up for."
"I'll be the judge of that."
She squared up to him.
"I know you're used to running things, but you aren't my boss.
Back off."
"You don't know what's out there."
"I don't think you do either!"
He stepped forward, his back straight so that he stood to his full height.
She was a good head shorter than him.
"I have a better idea than you."
She took a step back and made to go around him.
"Listen, however worried you just were, my brother Kevin is that times a thousand.
Now do you mind?"
She motioned back toward where she remembered the apartment being.
"I'd hate for whatever budding partnership you have planned to get off to a bad start."
He held her gaze for a moment, his dark eyes boring into her and sending a shiver through her body.
Whatever attraction she'd had for him in The Velvet--and in her dream--it had carried over.
She would need to get on top of that before she made an ass out of herself.
Finally, he turned and led the way down the street.
She hurried after to catch up.
"You need to eat something," he said as they walked.
"There's no way you've had anything since lunch."
They came to the main road.
Kristina looked back at the glowing blue ad before answering.
"I'll be fine," she said.
"Nothing edible open at this hour anyway."
"There's some food at the apartment.
I'll make you something while you call your brother."
She stopped and looked up at him, a smile on her face before she even knew it.
Having the richest man in the city make her a meal was not how she'd expected to end this day.
"If you insist," she said, her earlier frustration thawing by the second.
"I do.
I'll warn you, though, that the only meal I can do at all is breakfast.
So it's going to be an omelet."
She narrowed her eyes, though the smile wasn't completely gone.
"Why breakfast?"
she asked, half-guessing the answer.
They came to Washtenaw, the street they needed to turn down to get to the apartment.
He put his hand on the small of her back firmly, seemingly to make sure she turned.
"Perhaps you'll find out."
"I don't think so," she said, turning on him.
"I don't know what else you have in mind, but it's not going to be like that."
His sharp brows shot up.
"Like what, Kristina?"
"Don't play dumb with me, you big oaf."
He smiled, his lips drawing back to expose perfect white teeth.
"Call me Landon, please."
She sighed.
"Okay, Landon.
I just ran for my life a couple hours ago.
If you try to get in my pants, I'll have to tell my superiors you were murdered."
He laughed.
"Your point is taken.
We'll talk at the apartment and I will fill you in on what I know there."
He turned and led the way without another word.
Kristina followed closely down the dark street, and soon they were in front of the apartment.
It was a two story brick building that appeared to have four units.
They walked up some stairs to their spot in the front second floor apartment.
He turned to her at the door.
"The key, please."
She complied wordlessly.
After a brief battle with the lock, he opened the door and stepped aside for her to enter.
Landon came in behind her and turned on the lights.
For the first time, she got a good look at the apartment.
It was like many of the places she and her friends had lived in as soon as they moved out.
Beige, almost institutional walls.
A horrendous dark blue carpet that probably hid stains well.
Cheap light fixtures in the ceiling.
The bones of the place were in stark contrast to how it had been furnished.
The fine leather couch and oak coffee sat opposite from the huge vid screen looked like they belonged in another place.
Tatum hadn't been creative, but he hadn't been cheap either.
She looked around for a place to sit, but there was just the couch in the living room and some stools beside the gray laminated counter-top.
She went for a stool and opened her box on the counter.
Landon immediately went to the fridge and got to work on her omelet.
"What are you going to tell him?"
Landon asked, as he cracked some eggs into a bowl.
She looked up at him, her jaw tense.
His sharp cheek bones looked particularly pronounced in the kitchen light.
"Just that I'm alive and okay," she said.
He looked up from his work, his sharp, dark eyes flashing.
"Are you going to tell him you found me?"
She took a deep breath.
He had a point.
Kevin was going to have follow-up questions.
"I ask," Landon started, "because if you decide not to work with me, I would very much prefer you not divulge that information."
Her back went straight and her cheeks warmed.
She looked up at Landon with a hard gaze.
"Is that a threat?"
He waved his hand dismissively, defusing the situation, though his dark eyes had narrowed and pulled out a brand new cutting board.
"Merely a request.
Hear me out before you tell him you found me."
She considered.
If she was Kevin, she would want the news he was okay as soon as possible.
Strangers or near-strangers be damned.
"Okay," she said.
"I'm going to call him.
But I'll cut him off when he asks questions and tell him I'll be in touch again shortly.
In between you can tell me whatever it is you're planning."
He took some more ingredients out of the fridge.
"Very well," he said.
"Though if you don't mind, Kristina, I'd rather you have the conversation here."
"So you can eavesdrop?"
"It doesn't sound like a long conversation.
And my life is at stake.
Along with many, many more lives."
He put the ingredients for the omelet--cheese, ham, a red bell pepper, and an onion--on the counter.
"Plus, I'm making you breakfast."
Not wanting to argue, she got back to the business of unpacking and then activating the comm device.
Landon set to work cutting up the pepper without bothering her any further.
By the time she had the device activated, Landon already had the omelet cooking.
Toast had gone in the toaster.
