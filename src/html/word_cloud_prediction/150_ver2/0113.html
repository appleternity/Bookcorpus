The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

"You're quite right.
Glad mine are still in elementary school.
Ten years from now I'll be happy just to know they aren't out breaking the law!"
The two men chuckled at that.
Before Dirk could say anything more, a voice came over the PA system.
"Life Flight 203, please respond.
This is an emergency life flight request."
"That's me," Dirk said.
"Again?
Man, it's busy tonight."
"Haven't you been paying attention?
It's busy every night."
Across the hospital, Rita was busy patching up a child who had fallen in the playground earlier that day and cut herself on a broken glass bottle.
The school nurse had wrapped it, but the mother had wisely chosen to bring the girl in for stitches, even though it would cost the family nearly a week's wages for the service.
"There," Rita said, smiling.
"You're as good as new.
Now, you need to keep it clean and dry, all right?"
The girl nodded, her eyes too wide.
Rita turned to the mom.
"I'll wrap it.
Leave the bandages on for a day or two.
After that, a mitten will work fine.
In two weeks take a clean pair of scissors or nail clippers and cut the knot on the stitches.
You may have to wet them to get them to come out.
Just put a bandage on it for a few days after that and she'll be fine."
"Thank you.
Thank you so much."
As mother and daughter filed out of the exam room, a red light in the hall began to flash.
Rita left it and turned her attention to cleaning up the exam room, but another nurse stuck her head in the door.
"Multiple victims, looks like a car crash."
"Do you need me there?
Or should I keep working through the ER backlog?"
"Better stay on ER.
I'll page you if you're needed."
Rita nodded.
She preferred working with people who had come into the emergency room with cuts and scrapes and strange symptoms.
They were usually so grateful to finally see someone, and the ones who were angry she could forgive since they were angry at the system and not directly at her.
Those patients made the nights long, but since most of them had been sitting in that crowded waiting room for eight hours they had every right to be upset.
Rita met Dirk at the bus station at the end of their ten-hour shift and gave him a kiss on the cheek before slipping her arm through his.
"Are you as tired as I am?"
"Probably," he said.
"The bus is late again.
It doesn't look like we'll make it home before the kids leave."
"Maybe I should trade with Mary.
She's been asking for nights again.
Then one of us would be home all the time."
"Home and sleeping."
"At least we'd be there if the kids needed us.
Rushell's only fifteen and I know Garth is trying to act grown up, but is it really fair of us to ask him to look out for his sister like this?"
Dirk yawned.
"We'll talk about it, okay?
Right now I just want to get off my feet."
They ended up standing the whole ride to their corner, and they made it to the front door of the building just as Garth and Rushell were coming out.
"Good morning," Rita said, holding her arms wide.
Rushell gave her mom a hug.
"Good night mom."
Garth slipped by and started down the sidewalk.
"Would you hurry up?"
he snapped.
Rushell rolled her eyes and said, "He's been pushy for days now!"
Rita laughed.
"He's right though.
I'll see you when you get home."
She stood and waved until both kids were out of sight.
"So what's your problem?"
Rushell said, kicking a stone along the sidewalk ahead of her.
"Nothing."
"Yeah, right, I believe you. Not.
Did you get into a fight with your friends?"
"No."
"Are you sure?
You've been sticking close to home all week.
If you're not fighting with them why aren't you spending every evening with them while Mom and Dad are at work like you always do?"
"Would you stop pushing?
I don't want to talk about it, okay?"
"Fine."
She watched him storm off towards school and said softly, "I just wish you would talk to me."
Chapter 3
"Left here," Tony said.
"Tony, we're flying.
I don't have to follow the roads," Dirk replied, but banked the air ambulance left anyways.
It was their fifth run of the night and their shift wasn't even a third over.
Dirk held the air ambulance steady while Tony, with the help of the cops on the scene, loaded the gunshot victim off the curb and into the back.
"Another one for the morgue," Tony reported as he jumped back into the co-pilot's seat.
"It's turning into another rough night," Dirk said.
"And another and another and another," Tony agreed.
"Can we stop for coffee?"
Tony had been Dirk's loading partner for nearly a year, and Dirk was used to the other man's dry humor.
They were very similar in appearance; Dirk's mixed heritage had left him with a skin tone very similar to the big Italian.
They also had the same dark hair, though at forty-eight Dirk's was beginning to thin and lighten.
They pulled into the morgue and spotted four police vehicles parked over near the emergency room doors.
"You don't often see them out so late, especially not here," Dirk said.
"Maybe somebody important got shot," Tony said.
"Because they sure aren't here for this stiff."
They unloaded the body, signed the e-register, grabbed a fresh stretcher and the next call on the info-roster, and headed back out into the city.
Rita was looking for a fight, so she focused on the computer work in front of her.
She dealt with a lot in this job; she had seen everything, even a few things that had made her laugh.
Only in nursing could you watch someone die one minute and then listen to a man try to explain how "that" got "up there" the next.
But it was cases like this that woke her inner mother bear and brought out her temper.
The girl had a broken arm.
The father said she fell down the stairs.
The mother was sobbing too hard to add anything useful to the situation.
The girl was strangely quiet.
The x-rays revealed a twist fracture, more common in cases where the arm was grabbed than in falls, even down a set of stairs.
But all Rita could do was put on the cast and write her suspicions on the medical report to be ignored by an over-worked system.
"Another one?
How do you end up with all the battered kids?"
Rita glanced up.
"God, Pam, what the hell is wrong with people?
She's six years old."
Pam jerked her head to point down the hallway.
"Maybe they're here to do something about it for a change."
Rita leaned over the counter of the nurses' station to find two police officers in their gray shirts and black bulletproof vests speaking with the hospital director.
She snorted.
"More likely they're here because some politician came in for a vaccine and left with a hangnail."
"Well, they're coming this way."
Pam rapped her knuckles on the counter once and headed for her next patient.
Rita went back to her computer work expecting the police to walk right past her.
When she looked up next, she found herself face-to-face with the hospital director.
"Sir, I'm sorry to make you wait," she said, pushing the chair back and standing.
"What can I do to help you?"
"Mrs. Haston, I'm very sorry about this."
He'd never called her by her last name before; most of the nurses found he was too casual and 'friendly' with them for their liking.
His nervous demeanor was also a change from the arrogant over-confidence he generally displayed.
"Sorry about what?"
"I need you to go with these two officers."
"Is this about the abuse cases?
Really, it's just my job to report suspicions.
None of those cases was ever proven or even brought to police attention."
"Please, Rita, just go."
"No.
Go with them where?
What is going on?"
One officer stepped forward.
"Mrs.
Haston, you need to come with us, now.
We have a warrant for your arrest."
Rita laughed.
"You must have the wrong person.
I've never broken a law in my life.
My family, they're good people.
We've done nothing wrong."
"Escort her out."
"No." Rita pulled her arm away.
"You can't do this!
I've done nothing wrong.
Don't touch me.
Don't you fucking touch me!"
They had her cornered in the nurses' station, and each of the officers easily outweighed her.
They gripped her under each arm and at each elbow and started to walk out, but Rita dug in and started to scream again.
