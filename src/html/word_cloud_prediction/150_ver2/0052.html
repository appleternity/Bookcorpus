The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.

In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

"Can you do me a favor, Veronique?"
"What?"
"Stop being such a stubborn bitch, shut the fuck up, and listen to me.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm telling you that I think I may know where you can find the computer.
I know that's what you're looking for."
"W-h-a-t?"
Pointe's look was suddenly jovial, the kind one shows when an unexpected gift just drops into your lap.
"You're not dicking us around, are you?"
"Nope."
"Wait a minute," he said, holding up a hand.
"Just how in the fuck did you know what we were looking in the first place?"
I leaned forward and went hard.
"Because I'm looking for the same thing myself."
"That's not telling me anything."
"Does it really matter?
At this point?"
Although I had no specific idea what they were after, I fronted as though I had my own reasons for doing such.
The security chief gave Merchant an unsure glance before returning to me.
"So, let's say we took you up on your offer.
What do you want out of this?"
"Well, since your girlfriend here has already spilled the beans, so to speak, the way I figure it is, we're all are here now.
In this meeting that just happens to be, well, coincidental.
Why not make a deal?
I don't know what you guys are after, neither do I give a fuck.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm going for some very controversial pictures that my client wants destroyed," I said with a sincere look, trying to put up the best, believable lie I could manufacture on the fly.
"Her main objective is, she doesn't want any of them getting out into the public.
Add to the fact that I'm being paid rather handsomely, again, I really don't give a fuck what you guys want.
I just want those damn pictures so that I can get paid."
"Why is your client so worried those pictures?"
"Yeah," Merchant chimed in.
"What kind of pictures are they?"
I paused for a moment just for effect, raising my eyebrows with caution.
"I don't think you wanna know."
"I think he's lying to us," Veronique threw in cynically.
"Can you prove it?"
"And that's the very problem I'm having...Greg!...Your client?
Pictures of controversy?
I mean, come on.
You're no construction worker.
Who in the hell are you anyway?"
"You really wanna know, Veronique?"
"Yeah."
I pulled out my wallet and showed them my blue card.
"A private investigator?"
Pointe asked.
"Now will you get a load of that?"
Veronique stiffened a bit, eyeing me with more suspicion this time.
"I knew it!"
she said, balling her fists.
"Greg the construction worker, eh?
Just taking care of a little business at the MD Group?"
"You wanted to know."
"So, let me get this straight," Pointe queried.
"You've been following her all this time...just to get these pictures off of this computer?"
"That's correct."
"And that's all you want?"
"That's all I'm askin' for."
"I find that kind of hard to believe."
"I don't get paid to give a fuck about beliefs.
I get paid to produce results."
"That's fine," Pointe said, pulling out a pistol to make his point.
"But it's not gonna work that way this time, Greenley."
"So, no deal, huh?"
He shook his head slowly with an evil grin.
"Nope.
Sorry.
But look at it this way.
All of that work you've done?
At least it paid off.
For us, of course.
You know like they say.
Finders keepers, losers weepers."
Veronique exhibited a more confident stance as she stood behind Pointe.
"You're not going to kill him, are you?"
she asked skeptically.
"No.
I'm not going to kill him. Now." Pointe stood up as he kept the gun directed at me.
"We're just going to take a nice little trip.
Get a few things verified.
And then we'll see what we're going to do with him."
"You're a lousy negotiator," I said to him.
"Can't be good at everything."
He motioned the Glock pistol at me.
"Come on, Greenley.
You've got more work to do."
I stood from the chair as the security chief ordered.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But at least I was getting out of this freezing situation, and into another.
(Back To Top)
Chapter 22
Friday--9:45 P. M.
I might have been under considerable duress, but the trip in the five-hundred and-twenty horsepower German sports sedan was one helluva ride.
Even if it might have been my last one in this life.
We were in the same car that almost crashed into the Grand National on the freeway nearly three days ago.
As we drove in thickened silence, I took note of the details of its interior.
The smart-looking natural leather seats, indeed, felt plush and very comfortable, while at the same time deepening the suspense of the trio's intentions for me.
Its sunken, dark matte luster would have been the perfect setting for a movie of my demise, if one were ever to be made.
I watched Pointe's nameless henchman drive the muscled Audi S8 with a finesse that might have come easy after a few thousand miles on the streets of San Diego.
All throughout the apprehensive trip to Gunn's house, he'd play every now and then with a variety of shiny technical gadgets on the stylish instrument panel and the wide center console engulfed between the two front seats.
They kept him amused at each traffic light at which we stopped.
The car's interior was immaculately trimmed with brushed aluminum and walnut tree panels which shined like pieces of lustrous furniture, and buffed to rival the sparkle of the brightest stars in the night sky.
Clues were everywhere.
I noticed how Veronique Merchant's tattoo extended around to the back of her neck.
The etching sneaked at me from underneath the sway of  her jet-black hair.
Her head moved about with a stiffened nervousness, giving the first indication that something may have been incongruous between her and Pointe.
I tried to feel out their moods and silent interactions as the car traveled via all-wheel drive over the cracks and crevices of San Diego's streets.
The reflection on the small talk we had that night on the plaza of Club Waterz summed up Veronique Merchant to the letter.
If she had been lying about all of the things she had told me, she was pretty damn good at it.
There was something funky going on between her and Ricardo Pointe.
It might have been a stretch to speculate about their private lives, even purely irrelevant.
After all, it was none of my damn business if Jill was fucking Jack or whomever.
But the strange communication between them signaled a grander plan at play with a few wrinkles that hadn't been ironed out.
And as usual, Forrest Greenley had a habit of getting in the way of these types of criminal designs.
Pointe sat in back with me, giving a glance every fifteen to twenty seconds with that silly grin of his.
Maybe he was able to read my mind, feeling that he needed to keep his eye on me.
Sure enough, I was thinking and planning all along about what I was going to do next during the mysterious drive.
The eye of his Glock pistol was watching me likewise, positioned low and pointed within the canyon of deep leather between us.
It had to be close to ten o'clock when the aggressive-looking European saloon pulled up at the front gate of Gunn's castle.
I had no idea if the ex-Marine was inside his house. ...
But, man... ...
Was he in for a big surprise when he saw what I would bring with me this time.
This was not, I thought, what I had in mind when he hired me.
Before we got out of the car, Pointe poked me hard in ribs with his pistol.
His sudden display of aggression didn't surprise me by now, with that smirk stretched across his face showing how much he liked doing shit like that.
Some people were just purely evil, and did evil things just for fun of it.
I'd seen enough faces like his during a lifetime, becoming very familiar with how much their terror helped churn a world that supported wickedness over good.
"Okay.
Greenley," he said after a prolonged stare.
"Here's what I need you to do. No.
What you're going to do.
We're going to walk up to the front door.
Together.
Just the three of us.
Just like two guys and a gal who are here for a nice little late-night visit."
"Okay, " I nodded with calculated compliance.
Just as cool and calm as Denzel would.
"That's what I'm talking about.
Teamwork!"
He snickered with a crooked rasp.
"It's all about teamwork!
It's so fucking uncomplicated.
As a matter of fact, it's simple.
You and your friend give us what we want?...And bada-bing, bada-boom!
It's over.
You get it?
I get what I want.
You get what you want.
Everyone goes on with their lives.
We're all happy people.
