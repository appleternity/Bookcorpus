The State_of_affairs may be represented directly (e.g., outline what happened, the situation abroad), or as a textual source (summarizing the documents), or metonymically as some focal entity (a synopsis of the candidates).  'Frank has already summarized some of the reactions on his weblog.' 'Director Van Auken gave a brief informational synopsis of each applicant.

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Legal_rulings', 'tfidf': 3.0226493102540313, 'lexical_unit': 'decree.v / adjudicate.v / judgment.n', 'definition': "An Authority with the power to make decisions hands down a Finding over a question presented in a formal or informal Case.

Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Silencing', 'tfidf': 2.5722254907442803, 'lexical_unit': 'shut up.v / hush.v / shush.v', 'definition': "An Agent causes a Speaker to become silent, sometimes about a particular Topic.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).

This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Aesthetics', 'tfidf': 1.2707438468933105, 'lexical_unit': 'smart.a / fair.a / ugly.a', 'definition': "An Entity is judged to be sensually pleasing or intellectually interesting to a (generally implicit) Judge.

How delicious.
But I'm afraid I won't be able to indulge you.
A duel is only between gentlemen, which unfortunately you are not."
No one interceded on the goblin's behalf.
Raiden could see the lords and ladies all watching and listening, but no one stepped in.
Many of them hid smiles of amusement.
"It seems I am not welcome here."
The goblin looked around at the crowd, as if hoping someone would step forward in his defence, but no one spoke.
"I will bid you goodnight."
The goblin gave a curt bow and then turned and marched through the crowd.
There had always been hostility between the goblin and fairy courts.
The two races hated one another.
Over the centuries they had often been at war, but there had been an uneasy truce between them since the last war over a hundred years ago.
It never stopped, Raiden realised.
The pettiness and spitefulness.
The cruelty.
It wouldn't end when she left the school.
She empathised with the goblin.
He had tried so hard to fit in, but he would never belong here.
They wouldn't let him belong.
She saw the back of a lady with white hair, talking to an elderly lady with grey hair.
Thinking it was her grandmother, she moved toward them, but as she got closer, she realised she had been mistaken.
"You know who that is, don't you.
The girl in the black dress."
The lady she had mistaken for her grandmother was speaking.
Her voice was lowered, but still loud enough for Raiden to hear.
"They're all in black dresses," the other lady said.
The white haired lady let out a huff.
"The blonde one."
The lady with grey hair turned to peer at Raiden through her lorgnette.
"I haven't seen her before.
Who is she?"
"She's the Duchess of Northumberland's granddaughter."
The small lady gasped.
"Are you sure?"
"Of course I am.
She looks just like her mother."
"I haven't heard much about her."
"Well..."
her voice lowered to a whisper, "they say she hasn't come into her family's magic."
"At her age!"
"No."
They lapsed into silence.
Raiden was aware of their gaze.
She stared ahead, pretending to be oblivious to them.
The white haired lady continued.
"You remember the scandal with her mother all those years ago."
"They say the apple never falls far from the tree."
Her grandmother appeared through the crowd, her steely gaze fixed on the women.
"Come along, Raiden," she said.
She followed her grandmother, not wanting to be separated again.
"What did she mean about my mother?
What scandal was she talking about?"
"I have no idea," her grandmother said.
"Perhaps she confused you with someone else."
Raiden knew she wasn't going to answer her question.
The crowd had thinned as most of the people had left to take their seats before the performance began.
The fairy with the eerie orange eyes was still there.
He was now talking to an elderly gentleman.
"Do you know who that fairy is?"
Raiden asked.
Her grandmother glanced back.
"Do not look at him."
"But --"  "That is Prince Valerian.
It is not wise to draw his attention."
He would have to be a prince.
"Why not?"
"He leads society.
He can be merciless if he takes offence to you and it takes very little to annoy him.
You should stay away from all fairies.
Just because you're too old to be stolen away does not mean they're not dangerous."
"You mean he could ruin my reputation?"
"He could do more than that."
Her grandmother's tone was sharp.
"When I had my debut there was a fairy lady.
She was high up in the fairy aristocracy.
There was a breeze and it blew her back.
She tumbled through the air and her skirts went over her head.
One girl laughed."
Her grandmother was silent for a moment.
"She realised what she had done, but it was too late.
They found her dead in her bed the next day, her mouth full of ribbons."
"She died just because she laughed?"
"They have different rules.
They do not abide by the same laws as us.
The family got off lightly.
They had two young children.
They were fortunate they didn't take the children as well.
Fairies are a demon race.
They may look human, but they're not.
Do not forget that."
Her grandmother led her up the steps to another floor.
Curtained doorways led off to the boxes.
Her grandmother paused to exchange words with a couple.
A man stood by one of the curtains talking to a woman.
There was nothing remarkable about him except for his hair.
It was a deep red.
Raiden knew who he was, even without seeing his face: Lord Ignatius Inferre, the Duke of Exeter and Blaize's father.
The man who had been at Matherson's house the night of his death and also there the night her mother died.
The Duke must be in his mid-forties now, although no grey marred his hair.
It was the same brilliant shade of red as his daughter's.
He threw back his head and laughed at something his companion had said.
He moved aside, revealing the woman he was with.
Raiden's breath caught in her throat.
It was Sylvia, her aunt.
Cut extremely low, the black dress she wore clung to her body and her golden hair was curled into ringlets that bounced when she tossed her head.
Her lips were painted a dark red and her eyes were outlined with black.
She ran her hand along the Duke's arm, smiling up at him.
He bent his head and put his lips against her ear and whispered something to her.
She laughed and swatted his arm playfully with her fan.
She was supposed to be in mourning for her late husband.
Her grandmother turned from the people she had been speaking to.
"Sylvia is here," Raiden said.
They still hadn't noticed them.
They were too immersed in one another.
The Duke was widowed; if he were to marry again, his wife would be a duchess.
Sylvia would finally get the title she had always wanted.
She would also be Blaize's step-mother.
Sylvia finally looked up and saw them.
For a brief moment, the smile disappeared from her face.
"Come along, Raiden," her grandmother said.
She turned to walk away.
Sylvia left the Duke and hurried over.
"I didn't know you were planning to attend the performance tonight."
Her aunt smiled, but it was a false smile that didn't reach her eyes.
"And you've brought Raiden with you as well.
How lovely."
"Lady Northumberland," the Duke said, as he came up.
He stood behind Sylvia, his hand resting on her waist.
"Lord Exeter," her grandmother said, acknowledging him.
There was an awkward silence.
Her grandmother's eyes never wavered from the Duke's.
He bent his head and murmured something to Sylvia.
She looked at Raiden, her eyes filled with dislike.
"Of course," she said.
She cleared her throat.
"May I present to you my cousin, Lady Raiden Feralis."
This is where Raiden had to curtsy, but she didn't.
She stood frozen.
"Raiden," her grandmother said, a warning in her voice.
Slowly, Raiden sank into a curtsy.
"Your Grace," she murmured.
The Duke smiled at her wistfully.
"You look so much like your mother."
Raiden tensed.
He had no right to speak of her mother.
The Duke turned to her grandmother.
"Don't you think so?"
Her grandmother didn't answer.
"It was a terrible accident," the Duke continued.
