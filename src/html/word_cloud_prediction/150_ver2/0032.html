The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.' 'Unless you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.'

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

And he's right.
I need him to find Lou.
"Where are we going?,"
I ask him.
"To Caesar's, of course."
"Makes sense."
"Lou didn't want to stay there.
He figured in a Hollywood hangout like Caesar's he'd run into every swinging dick he ever knew.
But that young dolly insisted.
She wasn't coming to Tijuana and stay at no dump, that's what she told him, and if he wanted to get his bugle blown tonight he'd damn well take her to a class place.
And there's only one of those in town.
When I found out where Lou was staying, I got myself a room there, too.
Might as well be comfortable."
The entrance to Caesar's is just around the corner.
Inside the big double doors there's a long tile floored arcade stretching back to a bronze-doored elevator.
We get some attention shuffling through, but Nick stays calm: "Just keep the legs moving and the mouth shut," he tells me.
We'll be there in a second."
We're coming up on the elevator now.
The operator, a reedy Mexican in a button front uniform, smiles his automatic smile and waves us in, but an elegantly bald gent in a grey suit blocks our progress.
"Mr.
Flanagan, Mr. Thorne, can I be of help?"
It's the owner, Caesar Cardini, a piece of European jetsam washed on these shores after the War.
He's the guy who first thought to mix raw eggs in salad.
It's disgusting if you ask me, but it made him rich and famous and he's learned to act that way.
Behind him there's a powerful looking Mexican hard case in a double breasted white suit, which is a good thing to wear if your packing heavy hardware.
I figure him for the house dick.
"Caesar, old buddy, how you doing?"
says Nick.
"Good to see you, Mr. Flanagan.
Going up to your room?"
"Sure enough.
Jake here got mugged.
I remember when Tijuana was a nice place.
Fellah could walk on the streets at night.
I'm going to give him a stiff drink.
He'll be alright."
"Perhaps I should send a doctor up," says Caesar in a tone which says he's going to do it whether we like it or not, and maybe the house dick into the bargain.
"Sure, Caesar, you do that.
You know my room number."
"Of course.
Take them to three," he says to the elevator operator.
"We'll be waiting," says Nick.
The next second, we're in the elevator.
When we get to three, a bell dings and door opens.
The operator has his back to us.
Nick's still holding me up with one hand, but with the other he takes my rod out of his pocket and plants it, butt first, into the back of the operator's head.
The Mex says madre something or other and slumps into the hall.
Nick and I step over him.
"We gotta take the stairs," Nick says.
The door to the stairs is at the end of the hall, but I'm not going to make it, so Nick picks me up, fireman's carry, pushes through the door and starts down the stairs toward the second floor.
"It'll take 'em a few minutes to find the guy, then they'll go to my room.
After that, all hell will break loose, but we should be done with our business by then" Luckily for Nick, who's breathing hard under my weight, the room we're going to is next to the stairwell.
It's a big door at the end of the hallway with a brass plaque.
I feel myself sliding off his shoulder and propped up, nose first, against the door.
I groan "Who's there?"
It's Lou's voice from inside.
"Open the door, Jake," Nick whispers to me.
"No key," I grunt, trying to think straight.
"Don't worry," Nick says.
I feel his arm reach around me and grab the knob.
"It's open."
He turns the knob, the door swings wide and Nick shoves me on through.
I stumble a couple of steps and head for the floor not far from where Lou Carnesi is standing in a shocked embrace with the bounteous Gloria.
They're mostly naked.
The girl's wearing white knee socks over patent leather pumps.
Lou's in tented-front boxer shorts.
He's shirtless, his chest thick and hairy with four long, scabbed over scratch marks running down his shoulder blade.
I watch the rest of it from the floor.
"Nick, baby, what took you so long."
This from the naked girl, who jumps back from Lou as if he's suddenly electrified, bounces across the bed and snuggles up to Nick.
That solves the problem of where Nick's information was coming from.
" I unlocked the door when he was in the bathroom.
He didn't hear me.
I was scared to death."
"Sure, baby, sure.
Good job.
Now put on some clothes, we're getting out of here."
The girl scrambles after her blouse and Nick looks at Lou, who's mouth is slack.
"So what did you think, Lou " he asks him.
"That she was with you for the great sex?
Is that the money?"
Nick is nodding at the alligator case which sits on a night stand."
"That's it," says Gloria, buttoning her blouse.
"He was nervous about having it in the room.
Want to take it to the bank here and wife it the Mexico City.
But the banks were closed."
Nick has the top of the alligator case open and is looking down with a smile at all those neat stacks of twenties, just where they were when I saw them in Crawford's living room.
Nick admires them for a moment, then snaps the lid shut and hand the case to the girl, who's looking respectable again.
Gloria's all buttoned up now.
"Let's get out of here," she says.
"Just a minute," says Nick.
He walks over to where I'm laying, bends down, slips an arm under my shoulder and half lifts, half pushes me onto a chair.
Meanwhile, Lou seems to be coming out of his shock.
"Take the money," he says to Nick.
"The girl, too.
Just get out of here."
Just then somebody hammers on the door.
"Mr.
Carnesi.
Open up."
I figure it's the blunt little Mexican who rousted us in the lobby, and he seems to mean business.
"Open this door!"
It sounds like Cardini's voice, with most of the polish off.
"Are you in there, Jake?"
That's Suzie, screaming in the background.
Well, well, the gang's all here.
"Oh Jesus Christ," says Gloria, who sounds discouraged.
But all those voices in the hall seem to cheer Lou up.
"I got friends around here, wise guy," he says to Nick.
" They'll put you in jail to rot."
Nick doesn't seem to be bothered.
He's leaning over me, pressing something into my hand.
I recognize the cold slickness of my little Remington  The girl is amazed.
"Don't give him the gun, baby.
What are you doing?"
Nick ignores her.
He's threading my trigger finger through the guard and whispering in my ear.
"Shoot him, Jake.
Shoot the son of a bitch!"
I'm thinking about it.
Carnesi is losing some of his composure, babbling about something or other, his arms out.
I can't make sense of what he's saying, though it occurs to me he's pleading for his life.
I wonder absently whether Jeannie pleaded with him before he strangled her.
Somehow, I don't she did.
"I'm in hurry, Jake," says Nick.
"Shoot him!"
He lifts my gun hand "Goddamit," says the girl.
"Shoot him, Jake!"
Nick says.
"Why..?"
is all I can manage.
Nick is leaning real close to my ear.
"Like I told you.
I liked her, Jake.
I really did.
Now shoot him!"
I want to.
I think I can, if I concentrate.
The shouting from the hall is getting louder.
Nick glances in that direction.
"Oh well," he says.
I feel the gun being taken from my hand.
"You always did need someone to do the dirty work."
The cough from the silencer and the splat of the bullet hitting Lou in the chest are almost simultaneous.
I'm trying to keep from slipping down the black slope.
Lou has a hole in his shoulder above the heart, and there's a spray of blood on the wall behind him.
But he's still standing.
The banging on the door is louder.
Somebody's fumbling out there to get the key in the lock.
"We're coming in," a voice shouts.
