This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)

In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

He shoved the thought away.
It wouldn't have been the same.
He wondered where Clint was tonight.
Who Clint was, and who he was with.
The logs crackled and popped, as little beads of resin caught flame.
Eventually he had to turn around.
"This is a real nice house you have."
"Thanks."
Gayle glanced around.
"Maybe I could show you to your room, let you relax a bit before dinner?"
"That'd be nice."
He detoured out to his truck to get his bag, then followed her upstairs to a modest bedroom with a single bed.
She said, "I bet that bed's going to be a bit short.
This was Jesse's old room, and it fit him.
How tall are you?"
"Six-three.
But I'll be fine.
I tell you, I've slept in some far worse places."
She sat on the edge of the bed.
"Will you tell me about yourself?
Just, you know, whatever you don't mind telling.
About your childhood, maybe.
A mother always wonders."
He told her a bit, as he hung his three shirts in the empty closet.
About the house in town and his small school and always having a dog or two.
About his best friend Gordie and a little of the shit they got into, and that his mom was cool with it.
About Clint being born.
"You have a brother?"
"Yes, ma'am.
He's fourteen years younger than me.
I didn't see as much of him as I'd have liked, when he was growing up.
By the time he was in school, I'd deployed for my first tour overseas.
But I was around some."
Not enough.
Not when I should have been.
"He's a good kid."
"What does he do now?"
"Well, he's just seventeen."
And I wish to God I knew.
"Oh, of course.
Will he work on your ranch when he graduates, do you think?"
"It's not really big enough for that, and anyway, he never did like the ranch much.
It's funny.
All these years growing up, there was no doubt I was adopted.
Mom and Dad are both short and dark.
Folks called me the Viking kid sometimes.
But I was like Dad in every other way.
The same interests, the same goals.
Then along comes Clint when they'd long since given up hope, and he's the spitting image of Dad and they couldn't be more different."
"You can't predict how kids will turn out," Gayle said.
There was a sadness in her voice that he didn't understand, given the two healthy kids in the room downstairs.
But who knew where the bodies were hidden.
He wondered for an instant if she'd given up more than one baby, before those two got to stay.
"Nope."
Although the way Dad always rode Clint hard, maybe he'd had an inkling.
"You just have to love them, whoever they are."
Did she mean him?
That was a little uncomfortable.
He did wish Mom and Dad could manage to see it that way.
"Yes, ma'am."
She smiled.
"Now I said to stop ma'am-ing me.
All right?
Do you need anything?
There's towels over there if you want a quick shower.
Dinner's in an hour."
"I might do that.
And, um, I brought my tablet.
Do you have WiFi set up here?"
"Sure."
She went to the desk, found paper, and wrote on it.
"That's the name and the password."
"Thanks."
"I'll leave you to relax then."
He waited until she was gone and then got out his iPad and went online.
As usual he went first to his Facebook page, looking for messages.
There were a few from friends, one from his mother hoping he had a safe trip.
He quickly replied so she wouldn't worry.
But nothing from Clint.
Like always.
He added a brief note about being in Minnesota for the holidays, rather than spending them at home this year.
See, Clint, I left too.
I'm on your side.
He typed "Clint Albright" into a search, came up with the usual hockey player and the fifty-three white pages listings, nothing new, nothing worth looking at.
The hard part was that his brother had almost never gone by Clint, except under protest.
He'd hated the name, and its association with Dad's hero Eastwood.
He'd tried out name after name in some desperate search for who he was meant to be.
For all Sam knew, he might be looking for Adam Albright, or Toby Albright, or Chris Albright.
Or Clint might have abandoned his last name too, along with his cell phone and his laptop and everything else Sam could have used to track him when he ran.
Damned kid.
Sam rubbed at his eyes.
The screen blurred, but there was nothing there worth seeing anyway.
He put it away.
A shower sounded good, before sitting down to dinner with his stranger of a mother, his cute sister, and oddly hostile half-brother.
*** 
Jesse was trying.
He really was.
He'd had an argument with Devin over the phone, in hushed tones, about whether he'd done his duty with Sam already by saying hello, and could go back to the hotel now and have Devin's ass in place of dinner.
Devin insisted that keeping the peace meant actually getting through the meal.
So here he sat, eating his favorite foods without really tasting them and listening to Sam talk about his childhood horse, and the time he was caught in an ice storm on the way from North Carolina to New Jersey.
Sam didn't seem to talk much about his time in the military.
What he did say was mostly poking fun at himself for training mishaps, and minor disasters.
He was pretty low-key, for a guy who stood six-foot-plus-some and still had the Marine haircut.
"And do you have a girlfriend?"
Mom asked him.
"Or a boyfriend?"
Jesse said innocently, widening his eyes when Mom glared at him.
"Yeah, I kind of have a girl," Sam said.
He didn't react at all to the boyfriend quip.
Jesse wasn't sure he'd heard it.
"The problem is, right now I'm here, and out of the service, and she's still over in Iraq for another four months."
"Are you serious about her?"
Sam didn't seem to resent Mom's prying into his private life.
"Once she rotates state-side, then we'll figure out just how serious we want to be."
Of course, he has a private life that can stand the light of day, right?
Jesse shifted restlessly in his seat, and ate another green bean.
Emily said, "If it doesn't work out, I have a bunch of friends I can introduce you to.
They'd have fist fights over you."
"Um, thank you."
"Just kidding.
Sort of."
Dad said, "Will you go back to Texas to find a job?
Or settle somewhere else?"
"It's kind of up in the air right now."
"We'd love to have you nearby," Mom said quickly.
"To get to know each other.
Minnesota's a pretty good place to find a job."
"If you don't mind freezing your balls off getting there five months of the year," Jesse pointed out.
This time it was Dad who glared at him.
Okay, he was just done with this.
He stood.
"Hey, I'm going to head out.
I'll see you in the morning.
Merry Christmas everyone.
Nice to meet you, Sam."
There, that was plenty friendly and polite, right?
He ignored Mom calling his name, and quickly tugged his coat on and headed out into the cold.
The drive to the hotel was only a few blocks, and he felt the chill inside him warming at the thought of Devin, waiting.
He parked, hurried inside, and slid his card through the door.
