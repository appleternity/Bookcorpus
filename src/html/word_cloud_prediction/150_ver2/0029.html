This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

All that is required to be this kind of Competition is that there is some way of determining whether a Competitor will receive the Prize.  \'We won a car in the raffle.\'  \'\'  The use of win.v in this frame is similar to the Finish_competition frame, but there are a number of differences. Firstly, Win_prize focuses on what the Competitor receives as a result of their participation in a process. Unlike Finish_competition, Win_prize does not necessarily give any information about how a Competitor ranked relative to other competitors, or even if there is any system of ranking of competitors, or any end of the process that is defined as winning or losing. Win_prize only requires a system for determining which Prize or prizes go to a Competitor, if any.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

She knew what the call was about.
She had been running about a month behind on her latest and final book in the hacker series.
She had hit a wall with the ending for a couple weeks now.
It wasn't writer's block she had struggled with--it was her indecisiveness between two excellent endings.
She wanted to wrap up the series and leave her readers satisfied, while also leaving them wanting more.
Rachel's belief was that an author's rule of thumb should be to never totally close the door on a story.
Always leave it cracked a little--just in case most of your readers were lifers.
There were always readers that pleaded for either a sequel or better yet, a spinoff.
When she answered her cell she was treated to a colossal banter of curse words.
"Hello?"
Rachel shouted over the ruckus.
"Oh...I'm sorry baby girl.
I was involved in an altercation with the copying machine," the caller informed her in a voice brimming with enthusiasm.
"It's Robert with J&J just reminding you of that deadline, sweetie."
Robert was the assistant to the editor with J&J publishing.
He was also flamboyantly gay and made no apologies about it to anyone.
Rachel adored him because he had the kind of off-the-wall sense of humor that she possessed also.
Robert had brightened many of her darkest days.
One of those times came directly after she had been the victim of a huge fight on the phone with Mike over trivial things concerning the division of items bought during their marriage.
Throughout the whole conversation, Mike had made it a point to inflict as much pain as the evil man's soul could.
Rachel often thought that Mike had perfected the art of being a complete and total ass.
By the time the hour long argument had ended, Rachel was lying curled up on her sofa crying.
It had become something of a routine for her every time she had a conversation with Mike following their separation.
He had been an awful person to be married to and even worse to be estranged from.
Her cell phone had rang again shortly after she had hung up with Mike that day years before.
She had answered it screaming Leave me alone Mike you can have it all for all I care!
The voice on the other end instantly corrected her.
"Oh, baby girl, this isn't that jackass of an ex-husband of yours...it's me...your one and only Robert calling you!"
He had given her a much needed laugh, and she was more than grateful for the distraction his call had brought her.
Rachel's reflections on why she loved Robert were interrupted when he reminded her she had to talk to his boss immediately about the deadline.
Her final book in the series was in huge demand from the public, and was already on fire in paperback pre-orders.
Robert informed her that he was placing her on hold, which she loathed.
After about ten minutes, Mr. Johnson came on the line and commenced to lecturing her on her indecisiveness.
Rachel assured the eccentric old man that she would have it transferred to his firm no later than Saturday for final editing.
After making her usual promises and thank-you's, she hung up her cell, cursing her own procrastination.
She had just sat down at her computer to write the ending to her baby when her phone rang once again.
"Please, Lord...please don't let it be him," she prayed out loud as she picked up the phone from her kitchen table--she looked at the screen of her cell.
After the unfamiliar number on screen confirmed her worst fears, she looked up in the direction of the ceiling once again.
"Really?"
she asked, while directing her eyes upward, in a tone that was both disappointed and curious.
Rachel pushed the answer button hard.
"Hello?"
"Rachel?"
His voice was deep and sensual.
There was a subtle hint of a southern accent to it--she instantly felt warm and peaceful inside.
It was a feeling of coming home finally, it was the best way she could describe it to herself.
"Hi, it's Derek".
This was the first time she heard the voice that belonged to the man that would change her, and the way she felt about herself and her life.
He would be the man that would eventually pick up all the pieces of her that had broken off long ago, and carefully put them back where they belonged.
CHAPTER TWO
Derek Williamson had always believed that matchmaking amongst friends was a bad idea--plain and simple.
He always feared that if the relationship went downhill, then so could the relationship with the friends that set it up.
His best friend Ken had assured him numerous times that the dinner was just a casual get together between friends.
It was an opportunity for them to get to know one another before the wedding--nothing more.
Derek didn't buy it for a minute, and it bothered him that Ken would do something like this.
It made him feel as if he were some kind of pity case.
He couldn't recall any of his friends who had ever experienced a successful blind date.
If Kenneth Carter had not been his best friend since third grade, he would have refused without a doubt.
However, the two were more like brothers, so reluctantly Derek had agreed to Ken's request.
Now he was going out to dinner tomorrow night with the three of them: Ken, his bride-to-be Jan, and Rachel--Jan's maid-of-honor.
Ken had tried several times to convince Derek that all he was hoping for was that he and Rachel would become fast friends because they had so much in common.
That of course was a lie, but not the kind Ken thought he should feel bad about.
Ken had pitched this to him one last time as they spoke on the phone one afternoon, just a few days before the planned double date.
One thing that Ken did not feel the need to inform Derek of during their conversations was that the woman he was meeting was, in fact, Caucasian--not African-American as Derek himself was.
Derek didn't feel right asking about her ethnicity.
He thought it would sound presumptuous and paranoid, but something deep inside his mind was pushing him to anyway.
While he knew what that something was, he resisted the urge for now.
Another thing that almost convinced Derek of their differences in skin color; was the artful way Ken had of changing the subject if Derek started to ask too many questions about her.
"Maybe I'm wrong," he whispered to himself, while looking at his phone on the counter.
He had been staring at her name on the screen that he had already assigned to her number.
I swear if she turns out to be someone who owns twenty-five cats I'm going to hurt that man, Derek thought.
That would have been much more of a problem if he were interested in her more than her race, even though it too was an issue for personal reasons.
Derek could only hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.
Despite his apprehensions, he couldn't help but be curious about her.
He had been told she was a successful writer, who had suffered through a horrible betrayal of some kind at the hands of her ex-husband and a close friend.
Derek assumed Ken had meant an affair.
He knew though that his friend, being the type of guy he was, would prefer to not discuss too much of the woman's private business.
Ken made a living keeping things like that confidential, so he would let that be Rachel's choice if it ever came to it.
Derek hoped his friend's fiancee had paid his personal life the same respect, but he didn't count on it with Jan.
At thirty-nine, he had become a widower.
He had an intense hatred for that label.
It had been almost three years since his wife's death, and he had shared the gruesome details of it with only a few people, Ken being one of them.
It was just too painful to discuss it with others.
To burn to death had to be one of the worst ways to die--it was a thought that haunted Derek still.
He would often lie awake at night and question why she deserved to go out that way, but knew it would remain an unanswered question for the rest of his lifetime.
He also knew that well over two years was more than enough time to wait, but making his heart understand that was something that had been very difficult.
"Maybe it is only a friendly get together and nothing else.
What the hell do I have to lose?"
Derek asked himself as he picked up his cell off the counter in his office and dialed her number.
After hanging up the phone from their brief conversation, Derek knew that this woman was, if nothing else, a mystery.
She had seemed a bit agitated when she answered her phone, which left Derek wondering if she was also a semi-willing participant in this plot.
She had a raspy, sexy kind of voice that left Derek on the fence about her ethnicity.
She also had a hint of southern country about her, which only made him even more unsure.
He decided to perhaps send Ken a text message, which he figured would go over better than just asking the woman what color her skin happened to be.
It wasn't entirely a deal breaker for Derek.
Of course he would still go, but he knew at least if she were a white woman that he didn't have to worry about it being a set up or worry about whether or not there would be other dates.
Derek had little interest at all in an interracial relationship--he had been in one once, and it ended horribly.
He was forced to break the heart of a girl that he loved.
It was in his early college years--a time when almost all college kids experiment with something that they know their parents will disapprove of.
Derek's parents definitely did not approve of Carla.
He could still remember his father's words the day he surprised Derek in his dorm, and got a surprise of his own.
The old man had walked in on Derek and his young, Native American girlfriend while they slept in one Saturday morning.
After his father politely asked his girlfriend to leave them alone--the religiously judgmental man proceeded to go on a rampage.
"I will take away your car, your money that I send you weekly, and I will refuse to pay another penny for your education boy, if you don't end this today!"
After many heated words and tears, Derek reluctantly agreed to the bitter old man's demands.
He did, however, let his father know just how wrong he thought he was for his reaction and his feelings about the whole ordeal.
Looking back at the memory he could still hear the words that she had said to him as he explained his situation to her.
You are no better than your prejudiced father!
Derek remembered how deep those words cut into him.
They were the last words she ever spoke to him.
Derek couldn't make a young girl, who had fallen in love for the first time, understand that his education, and his father's support through it was what he needed more than anything--or anyone--at that time in his life.
He never wanted to hurt someone that way again.
He had been attracted to women of other races in his life after college.
To him, the traits of a woman that attracted him had no color attached to them--it was all about who she was on the inside for Derek.
His late wife, Claire, was actually biracial, but Derek's father never knew that.
He died several years before Derek met her.
Her mother had lived in South Korea when she met and fell in love with Claire's father, who was a black man from Mississippi fighting in the war.
To everyone who didn't know this, Claire was a beautiful, black woman who had only inherited her mother's light brown, amber-colored eyes and her wavy hair.
By the time Derek found out of her true blood lines, they had been dating for three months.
He was madly in love with her by that time, so the promises he had once made to his father paled in comparison to his love for Claire.
Had he known before ever dating her of her heritage, he probably would not have ever asked her out.
All because of some warped sense of loyalty he felt to his father, and the promise he had made to the old man on his death bed.
Although Derek had no immediate desire for an interracial relationship, a friendship was something he was more than open to.
I'm the best man...she's the maid of honor in the wedding of our best friends and that is it...nothing more, except maybe friendship.
Finally, after too much thinking and worrying about it all, Derek decided it was time for some stress relief.
He felt a trip to the gym was in order.
Judging from her shortness on the phone, he hoped maybe she wouldn't even show up for the dinner tomorrow night.
"As if I'd ever be that lucky," he murmured as he climbed into his SUV and headed to the gym.
As he drove, his thoughts wondered, as they always did.
He thought about Claire, the accident, and why she had been where she was when it happened.
These questions had haunted him so often, he didn't know that in the near future he would find out the answers to them and when he did it would change everything.
CHAPTER THREE
After her brief phone conversation with Derek, Rachel relaxed with a glass of wine after a rather emotionally draining day.
She decided it was time to tackle the final chapter of her book.
"May as well put this baby to bed," she told herself.
It was something she always said when she was in the final phases of a book.
As she flipped open her laptop, she had a feeling of deja vu come over her and suddenly her thoughts took her back to the house she had shared with Mike years ago.
Then: She was tapping away on her keyboard, the way she had done most nights while he slept upstairs.
The house was quiet and dark.
She could see every corner of that house as she recalled the scene.
She could hear Mike's faint snoring traveling down the stairs as she typed.
She got up, stretched, and went to the kitchen for a glass of water.
As she turned, she was startled by Mike standing in the doorway.
"Are you coming to bed soon?"
he asked in a sleepy voice, walking toward her.
"Why?"
Rachel asked in her best seductive voice, "Do you want to give a shot at some baby-making?"
Her attempt at romance was quickly brushed off by her sleepy husband.
"No, I just wanted a drink of water Rach that's all, I have an early morning meeting my dear."
Mike Barnes had all the skills of a cheating husband.
