Sounds are a subtype of sensation. In talking about sounds, speakers often provide information about how the sound was produced. A Noisy_event may be mentioned which gives rise to the sound. Alternatively, the sound may be attributed to a Sound_source, which is construed as a point source emitting the sound. A further possible specification of what gives rise to the sound is for speakers to talk about two physical entities coming into contact by motion, resulting in either friction or impact.   Although this frame is defined in terms of a phenomenon of objective reality, many instances of the LUs in this frame are metonymic references to purely psychological phenomena due to a strong metaphorical relationship between external and internal reality. Furthermore, many of the LUs in this frame such as chuckle.n or whimper.n require a perceiver's analysis of a sound rather than being purely descriptive.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.'

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

He held it there for a second and closed his eyes, imagining the blackness.
The noise.
A rush of adrenaline went through him, but didn't quite reach the part of the brain that pulled the trigger.
A thought stopped him.
What if he didn't die?
Was this the right way to shoot?
He put the gun in his mouth momentarily, quickly changing his mind and resting it back against his temple.
This was the way.
- Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thine will be done.....
The Prime Minister wasn't a religious man, but it's surprising what the thought of impending, eternal nothingness can do to a man's beliefs.
- ....
Forever and forever.
Amen.
Silence.
Was he dead?
A tingle in his foot and a churn in his stomach advised him that he was still very much part of the material world.
He tried to focus.
Pull the trigger.
He wanted to.
Needed to.
He just couldn't send the signal from his brain to his finger.
The door knocked.
The handle rattled.
- Sir....Sir.....
Steve.
It was now or never.
Lex shut his eyes tight and allowed himself to drift.
- Sorry Eduardo.
He heard no bang, he felt nothing.
He was gone.
- Sir...Eduardo is back on the line.
Open the door. Sir....
Steve was too late.
Eduardo Rey died of a heart attack on the island of Ducie, a couple of moments after his counterpart had taken his own life at 10 Downing Street, London.
It was at Prime Minister Lex McGivern's insistence that his own counterpart be tracked down in order to run the island.
A moral safety net that afforded him the ability to live with what he was doing to the test subjects, but which arguably had credentials no more honourable than that of a suicide bomber.
Ultimately though, his plan had served its purpose.
The Prime Minister was able to take his own life to stop the man who was threatening to pull the plug on Ducie; his counterpart Eduardo Rey.
Had the Prime Minister been one of the many test subjects over the years that didn't seem to have a locatable counterpart, the whole story might have played out very differently, but as it was, the Prime Minister's CROP-fuelled sleep state led them to Eduardo.
The equivalent of PS3,000,000 up front and a further PS5,000,000 on completion of the project and Ducie had itself its first leader.
Eduardo had strongly suspected that he'd have been killed anyway had he declined.
He may well have been right about that.
Chapter 58.
Into the abyss
Adam Trundle isn't the first person to seemingly disappear without a trace.
History is fraught with examples of inexplicable disappearances that are accepted for no other reason than that there is no answer.
Or more so, that there are too many possible answers and not enough evidence to support the logical theories of murder, abduction or the simple fact that someone just didn't want to face life any more and decided to hide away from it instead.
Is it possible therefore that when the universe cannot find a logical way to dispose of a counterpart when his opposite number dies, it simply sucks them into the abyss or some alternative existence?
This is the question that Steve Towerbridge vowed to get to the bottom of in memory of his friend the Prime Minister, of Eduardo, of Lionel Martinez, of Andrea Fuentes and in what he assumed was the memory of Adam Trundle.
This would be the next stage of the counterpart project.
Whether to take the project public or to keep it under stress-inducing lock key would be another decision Steve would have to make.
All in good time though.
First, he had one phone call that just couldn't wait....
Chapter 59.
Do not do all you can
PC Kevin recognised Kate instantly as he steered the patrol car around a traffic island and onto the dual carriageway
- That's her there.
He pointed to an unfathomable figure in the distance.
- You sure Kev?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
I know that walk.
- Bingo!
Paul reached for the siren, but Kevin slapped his hand away firmly.
- She'll run if we start flashing blue you idiot.
Pull over just short of her there and follow me out.
Paul brought the car to a stop and the two men jumped out.
Kate turned round at the sound of car doors slamming and shaped to run away, but instantly thought better of it, whether due to sheer fatigue or the fact that she was still a good half a mile from the Institution, the only safe haven she knew of.
She stopped dead in her tracks and waited for the officers to catch up.
- Ok.
Do your thing boys.
Take me to the station.
- We're not going to take you in Kate.
You haven't broken the law as far as we know.
- They think I busted Adam out though don't they.
- They did.
Becky said you hadn't moved from the waiting room though.
- So what do you want from me?
- This place, the underground prison.
- The institution.
- That's the puppy!
- What about it?
- Take us there.
- You're wasting your time.
- So you made it up?
- If you like.
- Something tells me you didn't.
- Well you had a good laugh at me earlier when I mentioned it.
- Well since then, your buddy has apparently teleported himself out of a locked police cell.
I'm entitled to think anything's now possible.
So you'll take us there?
- Why?
- Well if what you're saying about the place is true, then it's something we need to be looking into.
Check it's all legit, you know.
The place isn't showing up on any register, so something must be up with it.
Who's running the gaff?
Immigrants?
Squatters?
- Government.
- Give me a break!
- It's government run.
You can raid the place if you like, but you'll be overridden once they call on the PM.
Then you'll be part of it, because you know the secret.
- What's the secret Kate?
- Look, you're better off turning round and going back to the day job.
Look for Adam.
Whatever.
You don't want part of this, trust me.
- But what if I do want part of it?
Kate looked Kevin in the eye, searching for some sign that would validate her trust in him.
- Just go, Kevin.
- But, Kate, I....
- Just go!
Kate shot Kevin a look that he recognised all too well.
A look that spoke of underlying truths.
That all was not what it seemed.
He got it.
- Well, ok.
We're going.
But if you change your mind....
He handed her a card with his name and number on.
Kate took it and feigned disinterest.
Kevin gestured to his colleague.
- Come on pal.
We're out of here.
And with that came the beginning of the end.
Chapter 60.
Permission
PC Kevin felt the satisfying, warm buzz of his mobile phone in his trouser pocket.
Sooner than he'd expected, but he'd known the message was coming.
He put the phone to his ear and navigated the maze of robotically spoken options that eventually lead him to one that advised, "You have one new voicemail".
The line crackled and what sounded like wind or traffic dominated the line for a few seconds before it was punctuated by the sound of someone clearing their throat.
- Hello?
Has it started?Right....
If you're sure you know what you're getting into.
Exactly where you just pulled the car in. 11pm.
Tomorrow.
Just you though, ok?
Ok...erm.... bye.
Chapter 61.
It's always the quiet ones
As Daniella Diaz's eyes opened, they were met by rays of the Ducie sun that didn't offer a soft and welcoming illumination of the day to come like they usually did, but instead attacked her retinas and pierced a cold tunnel of reality into her consciousness.
The weight of recent events fell on her from a height, crushing her under a torrent of bad memories.
Eduardo, Lionel, Andrea all dead.
Lucas missing, maybe even dead himself.
She couldn't allow herself to believe it.
She reached under her bed and retrieved the hand made box that Lucas had given to her the night of the beach party.
His words from that night replayed vividly in her head like a tape recording:
