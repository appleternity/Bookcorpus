In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talking about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .'

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Goji happily panted up to Mary Anne from her feet.
The two had quickly bonded thanks to the never-ending supply of failed meals that Mary Anne had scraped into the vixen's food bowl.
"Sorry, Herbert, I burned the oatmeal," Herbie's Mom moped, standing over a smoking pot on the stove.
"You could burn cereal, Mom!"
Herbie laughed, shaking his head.
"You really need to mind not to waste water, Mary Anne, this isn't Washington D.C!
We could have used that to do some cleaning.
This kitchen has a layer of dust on it thicker than the hair on my head!"
Beatrix warned.
"I'll get it one day--sorry Beatrix.
Take care of Herbie while you're out there; I'm still not used to him being outdoors all the time," Herbie's mom hummed as Beatrix made her way to the door, a swollen backpack fixed to her shoulders.
"I will, Mary Anne, your boy's grown a lot in the past weeks," Beatrix replied before turning to Goji, "Come on, you, if I leave you here with Mary Anne's cooking all day, we'll be rolling you up and down the stairs on your swollen belly!"
Goji pined three high pitched squeals as she was torn between her love for food and her obedience to Beatrix, before darting out the door and leading the way to the barn.
"Love ya Mom!"
Herbie called as he made his way out the door.
"Love you, Herbert!"
she called back.
*** The twins waited at the corner for them, apparently willing to suffer each other's company for the sake of a game of SleightSoccer.
After an awkward re-introduction to Beatrix, Herbie, Hollis and Brenda Lee were slowly cycling westward toward the churchyard, Lazy Sam sluggishly trotting behind them while Goji gleefully nipped at his back leg to keep him moving.
Beatrix had done little to hide her wariness toward the twins, untrusting of how brainwashed they may be by the Light Seekers, but Herbie knew it wouldn't take long before she warmed up to them.
The more he thought about it, the more he realized that Brenda Lee and Beatrix shared very similar opinions about the Light Seekers, while Hollis's enthusiasm for pretty much everything that came his way made him undeniably loveable.
But what truly won Beatrix over was Goji's delight in having Lazy Sam as company.
She nipped his ears and ran circles around him, pouncing on him whenever she got a chance.
Beatrix had been worried that the retriever would lose his patience with the vixen, but his response was careful and soft pawed, knowing all too well not to claw and bite back too hard, as though she were just a puppy.
Goji yapped with excitement as they approached the churchyard, the oasis of plant life a refreshing change from the dry sands that had consumed the Rift.
She scurried up the road, diving into the lush bushes and flower beds as though they were an ocean of life.
All the excitement was too much for Lazy Sam.
In a rare display of athleticism, he cantered up the dirt path after Goji, excitedly sniffing around the bushes in search of his new friend.
The others were soon laying their bicycles down on the persistent lawn and stretching out their limbs for practice.
"Maybe Sammy just needs someone to get him moving?
I've never seen him like this!"
Hollis smiled, as he watched Sam shove his nose in the flower beds after Goji.
"So, who's got a ball?"
Herbie asked the group.
The twins looked to one another and shrugged.
"Neither of you brought the ball!"
Herbie snapped.
"I thought Brenda Lee was gonna bring it," Hollis huffed.
"It's your ball, why didn't you bring it!"
Brenda Lee hissed back at him.
Herbie threw his hands in the air, "Well, maybe if the two of you would just talk to each other, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
Out of nowhere, a brand new soccer ball bounced into the space between them.
"I had a feeling you kids wouldn't know your ups from your downs, so I got you a little gift from the Sole Provider," Beatrix smiled.
"Wow!
Thanks, Mrs. Hunter!
Mine was super busted up anyways--we'll be pros in no time with this beauty!"
Hollis beamed.
"Not a problem, kids.
Now you'll need a goalie if you expect to test any of your plays.
Looks like you kids are up against me."
"Awesome, Grandma!"
Herbie laughed.
"Now I suggest you three rotate between defense, midfield and striking positions.
Pass the ball up from your defense line and get it to the striker to take a shot at the goal.
It's practice drill to teach you kids how to get the ball upfield into a striking position."
"You sure seem to know a lot about SleightSoccer," Brenda Lee commented, speaking up for the first time all day.
"I played plenty of sports growing up, though we didn't have anything quite like this.
You kids will have to teach me the finer details.
But for now, I should figure out how to goalie just fine," Beatrix replied, kicking off her shoes and using them to make goal posts.
Herbie and the twins took their positions, Hollis starting in defense, Brenda Lee at midfield, and Herbie ready to strike at the goal.
Hollis started with the ball at his feet, "So you see, Mrs. Hunter, the game's like a combination of soccer and basketball, the ball starts at your feet, but ..."
Hollis attempted to kick the ball at Brenda Lee's hands but instead sent it rolling toward the shrubbery lining the churchyard fence, "... your teammate can grab it with their hands," he concluded sorrily.
"Too bad the shrubs aren't on our team then!"
Brenda Lee laughed, Beatrix and Herbie doing their best not to chuckle along with her.
"Shoot first, and whatever you hit, call it the target!"
Hollis smiled through his embarrassment.
"Keep your kicking foot and your hip in a straight line, Hollis, then your leg becomes your sight and the ball will always travel in the direction your knee is facing," Beatrix called over to him.
Herbie made a note to consider the advice as he fetched the ball from the shrubs and threw it back to Hollis.
Hollis caught it in his hands and placed it back at his feet, then stepped back.
Heeding Beatrix's advice, he aligned his hip, the ball and Brenda Lee in a row in his mind's eye,and tested the arc of his leg a few times like a golfer about to take a swing.
His foot made contact with the ball, and although it didn't manage to leave the ground, it at least rolled in Brenda Lee's direction this time.
"Nice one, Hollis!"
Herbie called to him.
Beatrix left her spot at the goal posts and walked to Hollis, "Much better, but you're kicking with the tips of your toes," she advised, then turned back to Herbie and Brenda Lee, "The two of you come here, let me show you how it's done."
The morning progressed slowly in this manner, occasionally interrupted by Goji and Lazy Sam wanting to get in on the game.
Herbie tried to hide his frustration at his slow learning curve because as soon as any of the trio tried to perform the most basic of moves, Beatrix would stop them and point out what they were doing wrong.
By the time the high noon sun shone down on them, everyone was ready for a break.
Even little Goji emerged from the shrubs still chewing on a cricket to lie beside Beatrix and Lazy Sam, who by now refused to leave the vixen's side, trotting along after her.
Beatrix unpacked a canteen of orange juice and a lunch box crammed with cheese and tomato sandwiches from her backpack and called the kids to sit with her in the shade of the yew tree behind the old church.
"You're in pretty good shape for someone your age!"
Hollis admitted as he sat beside Beatrix.
"That's rude, you dunce," Brenda Lee scowled.
"Ha ha!"
Beatrix laughed, "I know my age, but I'd rather be sixty-five years young than fourteen years old!
Beatrix sighed deeply and wiped her lips on the back of her hand after glugging down some OJ, "That was a good start kids, but if you want to get your plays clean, you need to trust each other."
"What do you mean, Grandma?"
Herbie asked.
Beatrix lazily leaned up against the tree trunk behind her and gazed knowingly at Hollis and Brenda Lee.
Both Brenda Lee and Hollis huffed and folded their arms, turning away from one another in unison.
"Aha!
You two are so much alike, but you seem to be far more preoccupied with your differences than your similarities," Beatrix laughed.
"I'm not a naive child," Brenda Lee grunted.
"And I don't like to act like I know everything," Hollis countered.
"Well, it looks like you're two sides of the same coin.
Perhaps if the two of you listened to each other, you might find the perfect balance."
Herbie watched the twins digest the information and it was clear to see that neither could argue against the point.
"You don't know us," Brenda Lee scowled, rolling her eyes, "If I was anything like him, I'd have been bitten by a rattlesnake searching for Chupacabras in the desert by now."
Beatrix shook her head, "Oh, I was just like you when I was your age--stubborn as an ox."
"You've changed so much, Grandma," Herbie sniggered.
Beatrix shot him a mean look before turning back to the twins, "Now pretty words ain't always true and true words ain't always pretty, but listen up.
You're only limiting yourselves when you go out of your way to be unlike each other.
Stop holding on to all your anger and start treating each other like siblings."
"I guess I could try to be a little more open minded," Brenda Lee whispered reluctantly.
"And I could be a little more skeptical," Hollis replied.
While the twins were talking out their differences, Herbie felt his cell phone vibrating in his pocket.
He pulled it out and saw an incoming call from the same unknown number that had been calling him all week.
He carefully got up and walked back to the front of the church while the others were distracted.
"Hello?"
Herbie said after punching the answer button.
"Her-bert Hunter, have you been ignoring me?"
the voice on the other end replied.
"M ...
Melody?"
Herbie stuttered.
"Who else?"
she giggled.
"How did you get my number?"
Herbie queried.
"I am a very resourceful young lady and, anyways, you should have given it to me yourself.
You do owe me a favor after all.
Speaking of which ..."
Melody hummed.
Herbie swallowed hard, "H ... how can I be of service?"
"I need your help, Herbie.
I need to find my sister."
The words struck Herbie like a bullet to the brain.
He stood there a moment with the cell phone to his ear, the implication of the statement sending a bolt of fear down his spine.
"Yoo-hoo!
Earth to Herbie!"
Melody mocked impatiently.
"Are you trying to tell me that your sister is still running free in the desert?"
Herbie shuddered.
"Don't be silly, she's just not at the house anymore," Melody began, "Daddy says it's not safe for her here after her last little escapade and now he won't tell me where they're keeping her."
Herbie shook his head, "Maybe your dad's right, Melody, she needs help, you should probably let the adults sort it out."
"Herbie!
I never took you for a coward!"
Melody huffed.
The words stung.
Herbie hated the idea of being thought of as a coward, and it seemed that since he arrived in Paradise Rift, he had failed at every test to prove otherwise.
"Anyway," Melody continued, "If you knew my Dad like I do, you would know that she's not getting the help she needs.
Only I can help her.
I know she was scary out in the desert, but trust me, she listens to me."
Herbie sighed deeply, "She didn't listen to you when she attacked Ashverosh."
"If you recall correctly, I didn't command her to stop attacking that weirdo in the desert.
I was in shock.
She would have listened if I had got my brain together," Melody hummed.
Herbie chewed on that a moment.
The last thing he wanted was to ever see Daeva again.
But if Melody was right, if she could keep Daeva calm, it would present a unique opportunity to find out some answers.
"She could be anywhere.
