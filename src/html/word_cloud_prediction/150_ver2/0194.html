A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Connecting_architecture', 'tfidf': 1.5197888612747192, 'lexical_unit': 'gate.n / corridor.n / elevator.n', 'definition': "An entity is integrated into a building as a Part of a (possibly unexpressed) Whole which may refer to the whole building or merely to a sub-part of the building.

And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.  'The nation was crawling towards oblivion.' 'We were walking past almost reasonable and heading right for what-the-bleep.' "}, {'frame': 'Cause_motion', 'tfidf': 1.410140037536621, 'lexical_unit': 'jerk.v / drive.v / impel.v', 'definition': 'An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.'

'' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.

In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability. (MET)' 'It says a lot that he did n't come back.

            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically

Tammy's told us so much about you."
"She has?"
Sam asked uncertainly, but she didn't care.
Anger was boiling deep in her gut at being called Tammy.
Her name was not Tammy!
"My name is Tamara!"
she growled through clenched teeth.
"Not Tammy!"
"What?
Oh, sorry."
Brock turned back to the car.
She had to fight hard to rein in her fury.
He'd apologized, but he'd acted as though he really didn't care.
It was a matter of respect and damn it, she may have just met them but she deserved to be respected!
She forced the heat building inside her belly back down and let out a sigh to try and cool her down.
"Who would do something like this?"
she asked, trying to put the matter aside.
A volunteer fireman standing a few feet in front of them reached around the rub his neck.
He turned back and glanced at them before his eyes lingered on Tamara longer than was appropriate.
He smiled a little but was swept aside when Sam cleared his throat.
"Well, I see the police have everything in hand," Sam told Brock.
"It was nice meeting you.
We'll get out of your hair and let you deal with that."
He seemed nervous about something.
Sam tried to shoo her away, but another voice rang through the air.
"Sam Mendez.
I didn't expect to see you here."
"Fuck!"
Sam swore under his breath, then turned to face the officer that'd called to him.
"Officer Jenkins!
What are you doing here?"
Tamara thought that was a dumb question, considering the amount of police around them.
"My job," the officer replied.
"I saw you talking to Mr. Anderson there.
Do you know him?"
The man's face looked calm and relaxed, but his tone was cold.
"We just met, actually.
Tamara and he are friends."
"Tamara?"
Jenkins asked.
"Oh, you mean your little ... um ... friend here."
She noticed that he was growing nervous.
She wondered if he'd been about to call her a crack whore again, but assumed he wouldn't be so rude in front of the crowd that was starting to pay them some attention.
"You look nervous, Sam.
You know, it just occurred to me that you live only a couple blocks away from here.
Did you get jealous of your little, I mean, her friends and destroy their car?
Wait a minute.
Didn't I hear something about the aquarium where you work at from dispatch this morning?
Something about one of the dolphin tanks being damaged?
I understand that the security cameras were disabled.
Must be an inside job."
Sam clamped his jaw shut at the accusation.
"You're kidding me, right?
I didn't do any of that.
Or this!"
Sam snapped.
"Adrian mentioned that you were pretty rude to him last night," Brock added.
Sam began to back away, fear evident in his wide eyes.
"It was two o'clock in the morning.
I wasn't happy about being woken up!"
"Upset enough to take a bat to their car and toss some gas and a match on it?
But that's not enough for your temper, is it Mr. War Veteran?
I'll bet you went to work and took it out on those poor defenseless fish."
"They're not fish.
They're mammals!"
Sam was really ruffled now.
He started mumbling something about too many people and setting up a cordon.
What was wrong with him?
She knew he hadn't done anything.
Under normal circumstances, Tamara would have enjoyed watching the man squirm, but he was hers to make squirm.
This annoying cop didn't have the right to treat her man like that.
"He's innocent," she said loudly enough to be heard over the muttering crowd.
"I know, because he was between my legs last night, fucking me to new levels of bliss with his fat cock."
"Says his accomplice whore," Jenkins sneers.
"No," Subie said, stepping out of the crowd in her usual attire, or lack thereof, "Tamara wouldn't help with something like this.
She's a good girl."
Tama was shocked that Subie of all people would come to their rescue.
"Yeah, so good, she'd fuck this creep," Jenkins laughed.
"Look at her, officer," Subie continued, undismayed.
"You'd fuck her too, if you had the chance.
Hell, I'm straight, and even I'm a little tempted."
Very high praise, coming from the slim eyed beauty.
"Well, I'm taking him in anyway," Jenkins's voice said he wasn't going to argue this anymore.
"Sam Mendez, you have the right to--" "Hey, aren't you that officer that asked me if I was a crack whore, or where I could find any the other night?"
Alex stepped out, an angry expression on her pretty features.
"Yeah, it is you!
I thought you were just some creep pretending to be a cop, but you really are one.
What's your badge number?"
"Enough!"
Jenkins yelled.
Now he was the one backing away.
"I don't know what's going on here, but I'm watching you Sam.
Don't let me find you near any more crime scenes."
Without another word, Jenkins turned and fled back to the burnt out car.
"Go find yourself another whore!"
Tamara yelled after him.
He stopped and shuddered for a second, before continuing on.
"That's the creep that asked you that?"
Brock turned on Alex, and she nodded.
Tamara turned to see that Sam had moved back to his car, and was leaning over the back end, breathing heavily.
"I can't believe that asshole," she told him.
Sam jumped, spinning to face her at the sound of her voice.
His prosthetic didn't land right, and he crumpled to the ground.
Tamara would have laughed, if he hadn't looked so pitiable.
"Here," she offered him her hand to help him up, but he ignored it, using his car to get back on his feet.
"I can't believe you told everyone we ... we... ."
he started to say, but just shook his head.
"What?
Fucked?"
Tamara laughed lightly.
"We did, Sam, and it was great.
He doesn't need to know it wasn't last night.
I know you didn't destroy their car, or anything else.
You're a good guy."
Sam looked around, and she could tell that he was still bothered.
"You don't know anything about me," he told her, but his voice was resigned.
"I'm not as good a guy as you seem to think.
I just wish you hadn't said it."
"Well guess what, Sam," she retorted, starting to get tired of his attitude.
"Neither one of us knows a thing about me, either.
Stop acting like this is all about you."
"You have no idea what you're getting yourself in for," he told her, but at least he was smiling a little.
"Fine.
I'll grow up.
Is that you wanted to hear?"
He laughed at his little joke, but she didn't think it was that funny.
"So this is the infamous Sam with the massive cock?"
Subie's voice broke into their conversation.
Sam's cheeks turned that shade of red that Tamara liked seeing on him.
"Well, Sam at any rate," he told her.
Tamara noticed him checking out Subie's bikini, and jealousy wormed its way into her.
"Sam, this is Subie, Brock's girlfriend," Tamara introduced her.
The others walked over, and Tamara introduced each of them as well, except for Brock.
He was still talking to the police.
"Sorry about last night," Sam told Adrian.
"Don't sweat it.
If someone woke me up at two am, I think I'd be a bit annoyed as well."
The two shook hands.
Something passed between the two that Tamara couldn't interpret, but they smiled and that seemed to be the end of their rivalry.
"If you two are done seeing who has the stronger grip, I'm going in to lie down," Alex moaned.
"I don't know how any of you are even standing after what we drank last night.
I'm hung over like crazy."
"Only Tamara drank more than you," Adrian laughed as he let go of Sam's hand.
"Why don't we go get some coffee?
Brock can handle the police report."
Adrian looked around for a second, then grimaced.
"Um, you mind driving Sam?"
"Sure, why not?"
he said, though Tamara suspected he wasn't overjoyed at the notion.
He didn't seem to mind as much when Subie joined them, however.
