Call me a traditionalist, but if it would be our house, both our names should be on it."
"I'm thinking practically here."
"So am I.
It's not signing some one year lease or something.
This would be a mortgage.
It would be me putting my income and my livelihood on the line as a testament to our relationship."
"True."
"And you offering nothing new.
You keeping your place 'just in case' something bad happens."
"I never said I wouldn't help pay for it.
And this place is just as much yours as it is mine."
I laughed sharply.
"No it's not.
Yes, this is a beautiful home, Eric, but it's not mine.
This is your bachelor pad.
A little decoration and some window dressing won't change that.
Call it what you want, but this is your backup plan."
"Lauren," he said, folding his arms across his chest and pouting slightly, "we have been together for ten years now.
I'm hardly going to leave you high and dry."
I stared at him blankly, making a point with my silence.
"Look, just promise me you'll think about it.
At least give me that much."
"Fine.
I'll consider it.
But no more talk about it until the new year.
I need some time to get my head around it."
"Fine."
I peeled back the comforter and wrapped myself in its warmth, positioning myself as far away from him as possible.
He gravitated towards me as he climbed under the covers.
Reluctantly, I allowed him to curl his arm around me.
I pretended to fall asleep, relaxing my muscles as much as possible so he wouldn't continue the conversation.
He didn't pick up on my charade and soon fell into his own authentic slumber.
It was hours later before my eyes finally gave in and I fell into my own dreamless sleep.
So much for making the boyfriend happy.
Chapter Twenty-Five
"I swear that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard," Gracie commented bluntly.
We were sitting at my father's house in my old bedroom having some much deserved girl time while the guys were watching television in the other room.
With the door closed and firmly latched behind us, I felt comfortable enough to tell her in hushed tones about Eric's supposed gift to me.
"I know, right?"
I stared down at my hands.
"Don't tell me you're considering it."
I shrugged.
"I told him I'd think about it."
"Tell him you thought 'no'."
"I kind of thought I made that clear.
But the more I thought about it last night, the more I realized that he's trying."
"He needs to try harder."
I sighed.
"In order for this to work, we both have to make compromises.
He's willing to accept that I want to keep my job-" "I can't believe you just said that with a straight face."
"It's a complete one-eighty from where he was just a couple of weeks ago.
Back then, he still wanted me barefoot and pregnant in his kitchen."
"The traditional husband and wife roles without the whole pesky marriage thing."
Gracie flipped her stick straight hair over her shoulder and hopped up to her feet, unable to stay in place for too long.
She paced back and forth along the length of the room, her impractical stilettos sinking into the carpet.
How she didn't lose her footing was beyond me.
My devil's advocate had serious skills.
She was also practically reading my mind, totally giving a voice to my subconscious.
It was difficult not to agree with that, still something burned in my gut that said I should try harder.
Eric was making a valiant attempt.
He wasn't used to giving in.
Nor was I.
Maybe if we both worked our own angles, we could meet somewhere in the middle at a mutually agreeable conclusion.
"I thought that myself," I mused, "that he was putting the cart before the horse.
A mortgage is a huge commitment.
Granted, marriage is bigger.
But you would think we would do that part first, just to get it out of the way.
I wasn't about to bring it up last night, though.
He looked like I had just killed his puppy."
"I bet he acted like he was eight, too."
"Kind of," I snorted.
"So, what's your plan?"
she asked, absentmindedly picking up a picture frame from my old dresser.
"I don't have one yet.
With the lack of sleep I got last night, you would think I would have written a ninety page thesis on it by now, but I'm fresh out of ideas.
If I turn him down outright, he'll never forgive me.
I guess I'll just keep dropping hints and see if it gets me closer to what I want."
"And what do you want?"
"To be honest, I want it all.
I don't want to choose.
And that's not going to work because it's not fair to anyone involved.
I want the boyfriend and the job and the friends.
I just can't make the pieces all fit."
"Then maybe you're trying to put the pieces from two different puzzles together."
"You know, that's pretty deep."
"I have my moments of brilliance."
I smiled despite myself.
"I'll think of something.
I always do.
And why do today what you can put off until tomorrow?"
"He's not going to leave you alone until you tell him yes or no," Gracie contemplated, "just be prepared for that."
"I'm fully aware of this.
He'll probably pay more attention to me than he has since I left.
I told him I didn't want to discuss it now; I want to wait until after New Year's rolls around."
Gracie nodded, putting down the picture frame and staring into space thoughtfully.
All of a sudden, her expression changed and she whirled around to face me.
"You wouldn't, would you?"
"I wouldn't what?"
"Marry him.
You know, just to get it over with."
My stomach clenched as I replayed our earlier conversation and realized that's exactly what I had said.
I had treated a sacred covenant as nothing more than a business deal.
A practical merging of households and incomes.
That wasn't exactly a glowing report on the state of our relationship.
When I had thought about marriage as a little girl, I had imagined breathless declarations of love.
I wasn't even sure that Eric allowed that word into his vocabulary.
"Lauren?"
she asked as I stood in silence.
"You don't know something, do you?"
She chuckled inwardly before answering.
"The guy can't stand me.
It's not like he's talking my ear off when you're not around.
I haven't seen him since Thanksgiving."
I breathed a sigh of relief.
She was right.
Eric wouldn't tell Gracie what he had for breakfast, let alone confide in her about something as major as a house hunt or a proposal.
Yet now that the thought had been planted in my brain I couldn't shake it.
If I had associated buying a house together with getting married so organically, couldn't it be possible that Eric had done the same thing?
"You look positively green, dearest," she declared, coming to sit beside me on the bed once more, "so let's talk about something else.
How did you like your present from Blake?"
"It was fabulous.
And I know you were in on it.
You are so sneaky."
Gracie's face lit up at my mention of her involvement.
"She ran it past me when we were together on Thanksgiving.
When you and Eric were indisposed, she and I had a mighty nice talk.
If we lived closer to each other, we'd probably hang out."
Just how I had figured, my Indy best friend and my Fort Wayne best friend were two of a kind.
Maybe that's why the transition had been so seamless for me; I had a Gracie stand-in at the ready.
"If you and Eric end up sealing the deal, maybe I'll take her up on her offer," Gracie mused, referring to the fictional lease Blake had proposed on Thanksgiving night.
I glared at her, a reminder that it was her idea to end that line of thinking for now.
"Oops, sorry."
"I'm not going anywhere anytime soon," I stated more firmly than I felt.
"I haven't accepted his offer.
Even if I did five minutes from now, we haven't begun to look.
We haven't even discussed where we would look.
The whole house-hunting and purchasing thing would take a while."
"The financing part would be a lock though," Gracie teased.
"I know someone who could help you with that."
I elbowed her with a giggle.
"You know, the idea of a mortgage shouldn't be so scary for someone who works with them all day long.
But one with my name on it, that's another story."
"One with only your name on it when you're not the one calling the shots," she clarified.
I laid back on the mattress and ran my hands through my hair with a sigh.
"That's exactly the problem.
I'm glad someone else gets it.
If it were just me and I had decided to do the homeownership thing, I'd be fine with it.
I'd go find a house in Fort Wayne and be happy."
"You like it there that much?"
"Yeah.
