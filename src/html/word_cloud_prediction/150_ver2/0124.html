This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Touring', 'tfidf': 1.2228569984436035, 'lexical_unit': 'see.v / sight seer.n / tour.v', 'definition': "A Tourist experiences an Attraction, a location with a unique history or other societally recognized individual character, with the goal of seeing and learning about it.

Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Offenses', 'tfidf': 1.0664631128311157, 'lexical_unit': 'hijacking.n / larceny.n / battery.n', 'definition': "Words in this frame describe acts in violation of a legal code.

        <h1>Which word-cloud best represents the story snippet?</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

I can't come down there.
I'm sure they're following me.
They'll kill me if they can.
I know too much.
Leave in the morning.
Sail up to Newfound Harbor.
They won't expect it.
I'll be on the dock at Little Palm.
Pick me up in your dinghy.
I'll tell you everything.
Please ...
It's got to be over.
I want to live."
She was right.
I didn't trust her.
It had to be a set up.
Maybe I knew too much, too.
But what else was I going to do?
It was a bizarre request, but it was a risk I had to take.
I'd prepare.
Chris would have done it for me regardless of the danger.
If she could provide me with the info I needed to bring it to a close, it would be worth it.
If not?
What the hell?
At least I gave it my best shot.
"I should be there by four unless the weather goes bad.
I'll pick you up at the dock like you say.
Remember, I've got friends."
"I wish I could say the same."
She hung up.
When I told Sunny about my little cruise, she looked at me like I had lost my mind.
She was probably right.
She sipped her ruby Cab and stared at the floor of the cockpit on KAMALA.
"Come on, Cap.
By now, the Ghostcatcher should be able to smell a trap from a hundred miles.
Sure ... she gets you in that damned near deserted cove, away from any help or safety.
She already damned near killed you with the poisoned whiskey.
Now you're ready to jump right back into her web with no plans, no backup.
Hell, she could have a submarine in the basin and a torpedo with your name on it.
Get real, T.K.
How many times are you going to let Miss Poor and Needy suck you into another abyss?
Face it, this could be your last."
Sunny was right, but that wasn't unusual.
I was being dumb, but that wasn't unusual either.
"I gotta do it ... for Chris, maybe just for me.
If I don't investigate every angle to try to avenge his murder, I can't look in the mirror when I shave in the mornings."
"Okay Cap ...
P.T. Barnum said, 'There's a sucker born every minute.'
You, my love, are the living embodiment of that tome of wisdom.
Make sure you have your cell charged.
I want you to check in with me every hour.
Call Frank.
Tell him about your foolhardy scheme.
Maybe he can have a patrol boat or the Coasties nearby if you need them.
Hell, do what you have to do, my beloved Knight Errant."
I shook my head and took a heavy hit of Evan Williams.
I promised to make the calls.
She obviously wasn't satisfied, but at least she was quiet.
For Sunny that, in itself, is an accomplishment.
The hamburgers on the grill sizzled and spit a scent of rich beef.
If this was my last meal, at least it would be a good one ... and I wasn't going to beat myself up for scoffing up the French fries.
There wasn't much conversation the rest of the evening.
We ate.
The debacle didn't much affect Sunny's appetite, but then nothing does.
She wolfed down two monster burgers and I was lucky to even get any of the fries.
Meanwhile the Cab flowed.
She finally gave me a rather nasty look and shook her head.
Then she headed up the dock.
I checked my Taurus .38.
She was clean and loaded, five slugs in the cylinder.
I place it under a ragged t-shirt in the nav station.
It would be quick and easy to get to, not to mention deadly, if the situation called for it.
Chapter 17 I left about seven the next morning.
I wanted to cover the 40 miles to Newfound and have the anchor down by late afternoon.
On the way I made my calls to Frank and checked in with Sunny.
She was still in a foul mood, but hell, I was at sea.
Frank promised to alert the Coast Guard and fill them in on the basics of my ill-advised plan ... if that's even what it could be called.
I could tell by the tone of Frank's voice he thought I was an idiot.
So it goes.
Not the first time.
He knew that, too.
The day was magnificent. 10 to 12 knots out of the southeast, not much in the way of swells.
KAMALA was flying full canvas and making a steady six to seven knots over the ground.
She pranced like a Kentucky Derby winner, proud and strong, headed for the finish line, even though we still didn't know where that line was.
I sipped a couple of Ice House and ate some sardines and peanut butter on saltines.
It tasted mighty damned good.
I was in Newfound just across from Little Palm, anchor down and set by three.
It was hot, but the breeze cooled the furnace and KAMALA waltzed at anchor like the lady she is.
I checked the dock with the binoculars, but nothing but the usual ... at least until around four.
She appeared and waved, looking like a lost child on the first day of school waiting for the bus.
I stepped off the stern and piled into my Achilles.
The outboard fired up on the first pull and I was off to meet the lady.
I still wasn't sure why.
She wore a large brim straw hat with her hair tucked up underneath.
Massive, black rimmed sunglasses.
I thought I recognized them from a Prada display I'd seen in a window on Duval Street.
As I got closer I could see wisps of the blond silk trying to escape in the breeze.
Very short denim cut-offs and a yellow linen top that teased around her breasts.
Blue paisley Tevas on browned feet, the toes freshly painted a bright pink, fingernails to match.
She was wearing the Cartier.
She glanced at it as I drove up to the dock.
I guessed time was important to her.
A small blue bag hung limply from her wrist.
She hesitated a minute, then climbed into the dinghy.
"Thanks, T.K." she almost whispered, keeping a healthy distance between us.
I pulled up to the boarding platform of the O'Day 31 and she stepped up onto the boat.
I pushed the engine kill switch and tied the painter to the stern cleat.
She sat down in the cockpit and took the hat off her head.
The yellow locks fell around her face.
She shook her head and brushed them back with an insouciant wave.
There were dark orbs under her eyes, but her skin glowed like a pagan goddess in the sun.
"I need a drink.
Something strong.
You probably do, too.
It will be hard for you to believe me, but I all I want is an open mind.
I know how you felt about Chris.
I didn't kill him, and I didn't poison you, but I know who did, and I know why.
I guess it's just time to make things right."
I stepped below and pulled out a fifth of Evan Williams.
She watched and nodded.
"Just ice," she said.
I filled her request and then mixed myself a strong one.
"Maybe we should go below," she said, "they might be watching."
We went down the companionway.
The temperature was fine.
All of the hatches were open and I had the DC fan running.
The breeze was fresh and salty.
She sat on the settee and crossed her legs.
She took a sip of the bourbon and crossed her arms beneath her breasts.
There would be no invitations to seduction this time.
"Okay, Holly, or should I call you Miriam?"
"Suit yourself.
Either one works," she said with a hint of irony in her voice.
"You know a lot of the story.
I did con the old man, Foreman.
Actually he was kind of sweet in his own way, treated me great, and the millions from the tool business made him all the sweeter.
If I wanted it, all I had to do was say the word.
He called me 'Princess'.
Jewelry, resorts, the best people ... they were all at my feet.
I admit I did persuade him to change his will.
Those damned kids of his, Mercer and Estelle, were a matched pair, bastard and bitch, spoiled beyond any redemption and greedy as hell.
They thought it would all be theirs and little Miriam could live in the trailer park and drink Roma Rocket.
They only made one mistake.
They thought I was too dumb to figure it all out.
I wasn't.
When the old man died, I was actually distraught.
He loved me in his own way and he showed it.
Plus, I had the money."
"You know there was talk ...
" "Yeah ... mostly planted by them.
