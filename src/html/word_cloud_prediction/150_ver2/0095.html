Unlike Finish_competition, Win_prize does not necessarily give any information about how a Competitor ranked relative to other competitors, or even if there is any system of ranking of competitors, or any end of the process that is defined as winning or losing. Win_prize only requires a system for determining which Prize or prizes go to a Competitor, if any.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar.

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

She didn't realize that her flattening stomach was from the loss of ten pounds due to an exceptionally poor diet.
She often thought that she could be a model and had heard many stories about girls who arose from nothing to become the supermodels that commanded tens of thousands of dollars per gig on the runway.
She knew of one pop-music icon that lived in her car, even as they were recording her first hit record.
She wondered if any of those ultra-famous cat-walkers were intelligent or if they truly were the popularly thought of airheads that will do anything as long as a camera was pointed at them.
She admitted that there had to be skill involved and stamina, but it just didn't strike her as being mentally stimulating, which she needed regularly.
She had a favorite store to visit.
They were well known for being bizarre and "out there" with their campaigns.
It was unusual for her not to laugh at some of their ideas.
There was one poster in that showcase window where a woman had a large green Mohawk hair-do.
The funniest part of the poster was that she was dressed mainly in a single strip of yellow, smiley-faced duct tape across her breasts and a large clam shell covering her womanly parts tied by a yarn around her waist.
On her wrist was an obscenely brilliant diamond tennis bracelet.
She marveled that there were no words anywhere on the poster.
Apparently the observer was supposed to guess what they were trying to sell; the large Mohawk, duct tape and sea shell modesty, or possibly and most likely the diamond bracelet.
That model probably made a fortune to surrender her dignity like that, although Charlie would never recognize her even if she met her in person.
She stepped between two of the buildings and strolled down the clean alleyway.
It was one of the clean ones because it was barely wide enough for her to stretch her arms out to the sides.
Worst case scenario, it smelled like urine from those 3am visits by the clubbers too lazy to find an actual restroom.
No vehicles could travel here so no garbage seemed to pile up.
Bicycles didn't count and they often used this alley as a shortcut from street front to delivery area.
She emerged from the alleyway, leaving the posh and snobbish shopping area behind and entering the world of the blue-collar workers and the artisans.
Here she felt a kinship although she had no real skills, just like Man-Charlie said.
She had that high school diploma though!
The manufacturers, clothing assemblers, design studios, and wholesalers were located in this back side of wealth.
These were the people who made the whole fashion industry perform.
They created, tested, manufactured, promoted and delivered all of the high-dollar products from pretty much this very area, no larger than a football stadium.
There were "over-seas" manufacturers who made bulk goods but if you were looking for one-of-a-kind items or limited runs, this was where they came from.
Her creative attitudes seemed to explode as she walked past truck after truck unloading at the shops and wholesalers.
She heard no less than a dozen different languages being yelled in the din, amid the whistles, laughter, horns blowing, and diesel engines running.
Occasionally a small scooter would come purring by, a stark contrast to the industrial machinations meeting old world skill and artistry.
There were a few designers on this street who would use her to model some of their clothes to do design work.
She was a very slender, having an almost-boyish figure and apparently the most non-descript size - purely average.
She stepped inside one of the loading bays, looking for a familiar face.
The owner of this design house, Mrs. Kumi, who she called Mrs. K, was an arthritic, wizened Korean lady.
She had the most amazing flair for fashion in trendy America.
She wasn't one of the cable television millionaires but you could find her products in all of the elite stores, even if at the back of the rack.
Charlie sees her and walks over to the steel table where she is busy arguing with a Hispanic man in a business suit.
She is holding a bolt of purple fabric, pointing out a visible defect on the leading edge.
She argues first in Spanish with the man, then switches to Korean as she yells at someone else down the hallway.
She sees Charlie walking toward her and beckons her forward.
"Charlotte, you girl!
Come here!
Look at this."
She holds the fabric up in front of her.
Charlie looks at the business man and smiles, earning a scowl in return.
Obviously he wasn't feeling very good about the transaction that Mrs. Kumi was trying to work out with him.
Mrs.
K held the fabric in front of her face.
"Do you see that?
Do you think I can make a good jacket out of that with uneven colors?"
Charlie thought for a moment that she may even be getting the blame for the flaws which was completely unreasonable as she just walked up.
"Can I look at it please?"
The old woman relented and handed the bolt to her.
No expert in textiles, she knew Mrs. K needed some support, which was rare.
She was a rock, an unbreachable island with rocky shore lines.
She unrolled the fabric on the table.
The table was laser etched with a variety of lines and measurements, along with some strategic grooves for running shears through.
She looked at the aberration in the fabric and then put her hand behind it, feeling for an unusual texture where the difference was.
"I can feel an oddity in the texture at that spot.
It's almost like a different thread was used in the weaving process for a few runs."
The business man looked guiltily at her and nodded his head but admitted nothing.
She ran her hand along the fabric and then began to unroll the oblong bolt, letting it make the characteristic flopping sound as it rolled over on the table.
Once she had made two or three turns, the spots began to show up with more frequency.
Mrs.
K made a "P-sha" sound and started carrying on in Korean again.
The man then apologized to her.
"We must have had a problem with the looms."
He reached forward and looked at the defects.
"Look, it's on the edges of the bolts.
You could trim them and only lose an inch along that side."
"Only lose an inch?
I pay you by the foot!
That inch is fifty foot long."
"I can discount this bolt."
"No, I don't want this one.
Close your truck doors."
"Wait!
Let's not over react.
I'll call and get this replaced right away."
He flipped open his telephone and jabbed quickly at the keys.
She smiled and looked very much like a Cobra about to eat a squirrel.
"I want you to discount me ten percent on this order, just because you were trying to sneak something in on me."
"That's a lot!"
He then lapsed into Spanish and started squabbling with her, all while talking on the telephone.
Mrs.
Kumi finally put a hand on top of his wrist, calming him.
"Calm down Gustavo.
Go have some coffee and we'll work this out.
Discount me five percent, replace the defective bolts, and we'll call it even."
He smiled at her and took a deep breath.
"Thank you Lanye.
I've been through a lot just to get this one container shipment here."
He snapped the telephone close.
"I can do five percent without calling in."
"We've had a good business.
We won't let this change it."
Charlie was completely lost in the process, first thinking that they were going to fist fight, and now she's acting like a loving mother to him.
He walked down the hall toward the employee break room, his shoulders slumped.
"I don't understand what just happened."
"Charlotte, it's so good to see you."
Mrs. K hugged her warmly.
"Where have you been for so long?
Adrianne needs a model right away.
Her table is deep with projects."
Charlie had not been by for about two weeks and Adrianne was very needy as far as a designer was concerned.
She didn't like to use any other proto-type models for her work.
"I'll go help her.
What happened with your salesman though?"
"That fabric is ruined.
I can trim it but it is such a waste of materials."
She clasped her hands in front of her chest and shook her head.
"Why did you change your mind with him?"
"Oh, I didn't change my mind.
Sweet girl, that container by itself is worth almost three quarters of a million dollars.
A five percent savings is great big!"
She held her arms out wide.
"That last call Gustavo made, I overheard his boss tell him to make the deal or come home without a job.
He's been a good salesman and my number one connection to Costa Rica.
I got five percent and he made the sale.
We all win!"
"Is Adrianne here today?
Does she need me right away?"
"She's been sick without you.
I have to teach her to find other people when you're not around."
"I don't mind.
I just wish it paid more."
"Since you helped me today, I'll give you an extra fifty dollars."
"Wait, I helped save you $37,500 and all you give me is fifty?"
"Okay, okay, I give you one hundred but more than that you can grab a broom and start sweeping too."
Mrs. K looked at her appraisingly, "Hey you figured that amount quickly.
Are you a genius girl?"
Charlie held up her hands, showing how clean and clear the skin was.
"No broom callouses on these hands Mrs. K.
I'm not anxious to start down that road just yet."
She tapped her head, "I'll keep using this for a while."
The old woman laughed and pushed her down the hall toward the designers' stables.
Charlie pulled her backpack off of her shoulder and dropped it in a broom closet that she knew no one would be going to.
These people had an aversion to sweeping the floors, much less mopping.
They hired it out so they wouldn't have to, and that was done at night.
She knocked on the end door, which rang with an echo that gave away the size of the room behind.
Adrianne threw the door open and dragged Charlie inside, hugging her fiercely.
"I thought I heard your voice!
I need you!"
"Hey wow, it's nice to be needed."
She pushed away from the hug, realizing that it was more of a gesture to comfort the neurotic designer than to show affection for Charlie.
"I hear you have a bit for me to try on?"
"Boy, do I!"
Adrianne ran to the table and came back with an arm full of different types of fabric.
"How long do I have you for?
Do you have to go somewhere today?
"I'm all yours for the day.
