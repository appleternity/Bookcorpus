This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

She'd had them for more than five years, had them resoled once, and they were in excellent condition.
It was already hot, promising a scorcher, and she tucked her mass of hair into a ponytail and then clipped it atop her head to leave her neck bare.
She squinted, reminding herself to dig out her sunglasses later today, as well as her sunblock.
She now followed a very zombie-like LeAnn back to the mess hall.
If dinner had been delicious, breakfast was divine, with bacon Kristin knew had been cured right here on the farm, eggs fresh from the chicken coops, and raw cream for the coffee.
She refrained from giving the details of freshness to LeAnn, who perked up as she shoved the 'fat pig and cow' into her mouth, knowing she'd likely freak out that none of it was processed, labeled, and purchased from a supermarket.
As the group finished up, Dale appeared from what she assumed was the kitchen, wearing a dark green T-shirt that made his eyes look supernatural.
Kristin's breath caught in her throat, and she heard LeAnn's low whistle of approval just before he clapped his hands to get everyone's attention.
Kristin forced herself not to look away as his eyes landed on her.
Dale turned away, ready to address the group, but she had the sensation he was still looking at her from the corner of his eye.
"Okay, folks, today's adventure begins with a little education.
We're going to head to the stables in a few minutes.
You're going to learn how to properly saddle and bridle a horse, and then we're gonna get you all on a horse.
Can I get a show of hands for anyone who's never been on horseback?"
Kristin looked around the room and groaned inwardly as several hands shot up and several more came up slowly, as if the admission embarrassed them.
LeAnn was one of those.
Kristin blinked at her and leaned over to whisper, "You've never been on a horse?"
LeAnn's eyes glittered with excitement.
"No, and I can't wait!"
"Excellent," Dale continued, stifling the quiet muttering.
"Half and half is perfect.
We'll split into two groups after we saddle up.
One group will go with Bobby and learn the basics of riding a horse, using the reins, and sitting comfortably before you head down the trail.
The other half will come with me, and we'll take the experienced trail."
Was it Kristin's imagination, or did he look straight at her as he said that?
It brought back an unbidden memory of being with him on her parents' ranch, taking Maximus and Primus, two of her Appaloosas, for a ride out into the woods.
While there, they'd stopped and had what had perhaps been the most epic make out session of her life.
Something low in her belly heated, and she had to swallow a sudden twinge of longing.
She hadn't felt that kind of desire in so long it was foreign, and it frightened her.
"When we get back from our rides," Dale continued, cutting into her thoughts, "we'll go through how to clean and brush a horse, how to clean the tack, and how it's stored.
By that time, you're all going to be pretty hungry.
With the horses in their stalls, Wesley will have the barbecue ready to go in the large corral, and we'll get our grub on and talk about the evening."
Kristin could almost feel the protest that went around the room.
While she didn't necessarily think the majority of the guests were lazy, she knew for a fact they didn't understand just how much work went into running a ranch.
They were ready to complain about a couple of lessons in caring for a single horse, when in actuality, there were usually no more than two trainers and anywhere from five to twenty horses in their charge.
Personally, this assignment was a blessing, and Kristin welcomed the task.
Horses had been her passion and her main charge on her parents' ranch, and it was the one thing she missed in New York.
She would never complain about working with horses and only hoped Dale kept an Appaloosa or two in his stables, those being her biggest weakness.
*** Kristin mostly tuned out the lesson on saddling and bridling a horse.
It was old hat for her, and instead, she studied the group surrounding her, looking confused as they studied what Bobby and Dale were doing.
A few nodded, getting the picture, while some were bound to fall, not quite understanding the way a horse would push out its belly to keep the saddle from being properly tightened.
As each person was directed to a stall - Kristin counted somewhere around twenty-five stalls in just this stable and knew there was another one behind this - she stepped in front of a gorgeous white and gray Appaloosa named Rocky and fell instantly in love.
She offered her hand so he would get used to her scent, and he nuzzled it instantly, snorting and snuffling in greeting as he nodded his big head.
She smoothed her fingers over his long face, and her soul settled, as if Rocky ate her stress for breakfast.
"Hey, there, Rocky," she cooed softly, turning him side to side to inspect him more closely.
He had to be eighteen hands, at least.
"We're going to be best friends, right?"
LeAnn leaned over from the next stall, curious.
"Mine won't come to the front of the stall.
She's got her ass shoved into the back corner."
"I'll be right back, boy," Kristin told Rocky, patting his muzzle, and she scooted over next to LeAnn.
Sure enough, the dappled chocolate Hungarian Warmblood twisted its lips nervously and backed against the stall.
She glanced at the name on the stall - Bessie - and held out her hand, palm up.
"Hey, girl," she spoke softly.
"Come on, Bessie, come say hello."
To LeAnn, she muttered, "You can't be intimidated, or intimidating.
You have to be gentle, open, and firm, or one of two things will happen.
They'll fear you, or they'll think you're afraid and bully you."
She turned back to Bessie, who'd taken two hesitant steps forward.
"Come on, girl."
She motioned for LeAnn to hold out her palm in the same nonthreatening way, and slowly, Bessie made her way up to the front of the stall, sniffing them both and finally holding her head down for them to pet her.
"Now, remember, firm but gentle," Kristin said as she moved back to Rocky, who was watching her around the corner with giddy eyes.
"You're a damn horse whisperer, aren't you?"
LeAnn chuckled.
Kristin wouldn't claim that, but she'd always had a good handle with horses, felt naturally drawn to them.
She opened the door and led Rocky forward, taking the saddle Bobby had placed behind her on the saddle horse and making fast work of readying Rocky.
He behaved well, and she only had to wait a few seconds for him to breathe out so she could pull the belly strap tightly enough.
She heard LeAnn grunting and moved around Rocky to see what was wrong.
Putting her hand to her mouth to cover her laughter, she watched as LeAnn worked to tighten the strap, only to have it slide back and forth as she tugged.
"Wait for me, Rocky," she instructed, slapping his side hard and getting a quiet whinny in return.
She moved over and helped LeAnn, showing her how to hold the saddle and pull the belt strap at the same time.
When it was tight, LeAnn pulled away, and Kristin told her, "You're not done."
At her confused look, she grabbed LeAnn's hand, placed two of her fingers between the strap and Bessie's belly, and waited.
"It's perfect," LeAnn said, just before Bessie snorted and huffed.
Her belly shrank, and the strap loosened.
Kristin smiled and pulled the last few inches tight, leaving only room for LeAnn's two fingers.
"Oh."
"They do it every time."
Kristin reached for the bridle and coaxed Rocky's head down, getting it over his head and into his mouth with just a little extra force.
She led Rocky out of the stable, ready to go, and found herself tying him to the fence so she could help several other clueless guests with their saddles.
There simply weren't enough hands to go around, and she desperately wanted to get on the trail.
As the last few people struggled with the task, she was too irritated to continue and stepped out into the grass.
She put her foot in the stirrup and swung up on Rocky's back, the scent of him filling her nostrils and her body instantly becoming one with the horse's.
She didn't even mind as Dale rode up right next to her and stopped.
"What do you think of Rocky?"
he asked, reaching over to run a hand along the horse's mane.
"He's beautiful and well trained.
He didn't give me any grief.
It's unusual for his breed."
This was her comfort zone, and Kristin could ignore everything else that rested in the past between her and Dale, as long as they kept the conversation here.
"You know you're the one who gave me this idea, right?"
She stared at him in amazement, and that charming smile crept slowly over his face, making Kristin's heart stop again.
"I fell in love with your parents' ranch, and your horses changed my life.
Rocky's my fourth Appaloosa, and he's the first one that hasn't been a complete nightmare to train."
Kristin laughed.
"They're too smart.
That's the problem.
And they're arrogant and stubborn.
With most horses, it's a dominance thing.
With these babies, it's about love and respect," she said, running her hand down Rocky's neck.
She motioned to his shiny black Mustang.
"You like to live dangerously, I guess."
As if he knew what she'd said, the horse shook his head and snorted, pawing the ground defiantly with one hoof.
"Blaze is a good boy, really.
He just likes to surprise me every once in a while by breaking into a full gallop without me asking first."
Remembering that ride they'd taken, Kristin was shocked at his comfort level with the horses.
Of course, ranching had become his business, his livelihood, but she would never have expected Dale Prescott to become such a rugged cowboy...and to look so incredible in that position.
She closed her gaping mouth before she embarrassed herself by drooling.
She'd been honest with LeAnn; in high school, she'd found Dale insanely attractive, just as she did now.
But as an adult, and with a memory that brought everything back like it was yesterday, Kristin's urges were stronger.
She could guess at the body beneath the clothes, having seen the perfection of it once before and knowing that the years of hard work in the sun had likely only improved the tone and build of his muscles.
"Hey, Krissy, did you find what you were looking for in New York?"
The question was wistful, and it threw Kristin off balance, Rocky skittering slightly until she reined him back in and soothed him.
Trying to figure out how to answer, Kristin blinked at him several times.
"Well, I didn't really know what I wanted, other than to go to college.
I did that, and I landed a solid career that I adore, so I guess I did eventually find what I was looking for."
She hesitated.
"Are you finding what you want in life?"
He shrugged.
"I have the ranch, and that's fulfilling.
I've got friends and built-in family here."
His eyes clouded, and she was reminded of how the sky turned green before a tornado struck.
"I think I'm still searching for something, though."
He didn't say what, and the group of experienced riders had gathered around them, so she didn't ask.
Instead, she followed him out, with the rest of the group trailing behind as he took them into the woods behind the main house.
Chapter Seven Just Like Old Times It felt strange being separated from LeAnn, considering Kristin's best friend was the entire reason she was on this journey in the first place.
Being without her reminded Kristin too much of being on sabbatical, a quest for self-approval.
But she found she only had a few minutes to rest in her angst, Dale kicking up the conversation again about ten minutes into the trail.
"It looks like everyone in this group knows what they're doing," he mused, and Kristin glanced behind her, nodding in agreement.
While some of the riders were less comfortable in a saddle than others, everyone had obviously been on a horse before.
As she faced forward, Dale asked, "What is it you do in the Big Apple?"
Gritting her teeth against the urge to spew at the mouth about her disgruntling job loss, she thought back to LeAnn's word.
He'd never know the difference if she referenced the job as if she was returning to it in nine days.
"I work at a large marketing firm, with our clients ranging from shoe manufacturers to law firms.
In fact, I just finished a proposal for a huge account with a high-end retail clothing manufacturer that owns several brands."
"That's impressive," he responded sincerely.
"Was your intent to get into marketing?"
"I started out with journalism, but it wasn't creative enough for my taste.
So, I made that my minor and majored in marketing.
I discovered I had a knack for it, and I interned at my firm.
They hired me as soon as I had my degree."
Sadness swept through her as she realized she'd made herself at that company and was still being forced to start again.
"You grew up on a ranch, Krissy.
Don't you miss grass and trees and clean air?"
She laughed, the question relieving her inner pain.
"Spoken like a die-hard Texan.
And yes, sometimes the concrete jungle isn't enough.
But I'm happy.
If I'm craving greenery, there are parks.
I live blocks from Central Park, you know."
