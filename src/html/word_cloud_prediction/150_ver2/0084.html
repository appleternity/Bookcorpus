Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

The dot was growing larger by the second and seemed to be heading right for the farm.
The newly charmed blue dragon, left tied to its tether, had also spotted the red dragon in the distance.
It began pulling at the stake which held it, and yanked the stake free with just a few attempts.
With a cry of distress, the blue dragon leapt into the sky and flew off.
'Can you climb trees?'
Logan asked, dragging the prince to his feet and almost throwing him halfway up the trunk.
'Why?'
Logan pointed out across the sky at the now large red dragon.
Erik's face paled instantly and he grabbed at the trunk with suddenly shaky hands.
Logan pushed the prince up to the first branch and then hoisted himself up.
They climbed as deeply into the leaves as they could, and then sat still, listening -- hoping they wouldn't hear anything.
Logan closed his eyes, but the darkness made it seem worse, and he peered through the leaves with a growing sense of dread.
The first sign that things were getting worse was the turmoil on the ground below.
The young dragonets were agitated, trying to fly off and crashing into each other, trees and the ground.
The frightened cry of a dragon isn't a pleasant sound, and with dozens of creeling dragonets Logan longed to clamp his hands over his ears.
But he needed his hands to keep his balance on the slender branches that were only just holding the boys' weight.
A sudden silence made Logan hold his breath and a shadow overhead sent a shiver of panic down his spine.
His hands were sweaty and he began to lose his grip on the smooth branches.
He waited for the shadow to pass, but when it didn't he exchanged a panicked look with the young prince.
'It knows we're here,' Erik whispered.
Logan couldn't reply.
It was his worst nightmare come true.
He was stuck in the shadowy depths with a dragon hovering overhead.
A sharp squawking cry preceded the heart-stopping snapping of branches as the red dragon dropped straight into the tree.
Huge, sharp-clawed talons missed both boys by only a handspan, and they fell backwards, tumbling out of the tree as the branches shook violently.
Logan landed heavily on his back, with the young prince landing on top of him, and he lay for a second trying to catch his breath.
Erik rolled off and Logan looked up -- right into the glaring yellow eyes of a red dragon.
Which one?
Calculating, probing eyes flicked from one boy to the other, then rested on Logan.
Logan wanted to get up and run -- he wanted to scream -- but he just lay on his back staring at the dragon, unable to move a muscle.
A huge talon reached down from the decimated tree and brushed across Logan's chest, prevented from reaching him by the branches twisted around the dragon's body.
Logan finally regained the ability to move and crawled out of the reach of the huge creature.
The red dragon reached out for the young prince but Logan grabbed the boy's shirt and dragged him away.
The dragon creeled loudly in frustration and tried to free itself from the tree.
'We'd better run for it before the dragon gets out of the tree,' Logan suggested, still holding onto the prince's shirt and walking quickly backwards.
'I think the shed is our only choice right now.'
Searing flames licked the ground at the boys' heels as they turned and ran.
A howl of frustration filled the air and Logan dared to hope they might actually make it to the shed.
He had one hand on the door -- the latch within his grasp -- when he was dragged backwards with a force that bent him double like a rag doll.
He could feel a pressure around his stomach, and as he flew backwards through the air he noted that the talon wrapped around him was chipped and discoloured.
Alyxa had once told him that dragon claws were hard and difficult to damage; so what had happened to this one?
Another sound reached his confused mind, a loud angry yell that was definitely not from a dragon.
He forced his mind to focus and saw the young prince attacking the dragon with a branch from the tree they had been hiding in a moment ago.
The red dragon's tail was still entangled in the tree and it held Logan wrapped in its front leg as it tried to free itself to fly off.
Erik was hitting the huge dragon on the soft underbelly, the most sensitive part of a dragon, and it howled and let go of Logan.
He tumbled to the ground, grabbed a branch and joined the prince in his attack.
'Why did you come back?'
Logan asked breathlessly.
'You could have got into the shed.' 'You looked like you needed some help,' the prince said with a dimply grin, slamming the branch into the tender red belly again.
'Erik!
Get in this shed now!' the king's voice bellowed from the doorway of the shed where he was peering around the door.
The commotion had obviously been enough to get the attention of those sheltering with the young blue dragon.
Alyxa had taken in the situation at a glance and was running over to help, grabbing a branch as she ran.
The moment of distraction was badly timed.
Both boys paused and looked over, realising that they should indeed be heading for cover.
Taking on a fully grown red dragon was a foolhardy thing to do, and it looked like both of them were in for far more trouble than they could have anticipated whatever they chose to do.
In the instant that the boys considered their options, the red dragon finally freed its tail.
It reached down, blinded by the pain of being beaten, and grabbed at the closest attacker it could reach.
It happened in an instant.
One second, both Logan and Erik were standing side by side; in the next, Erik was gone.
The dragon took off vertically, in one leap, taking the young prince with it.
Logan stood next to the remains of the huge tree, helplessly holding the branch and watching the red dragon fade to a dot in a matter of seconds.
To the prince's credit, he hadn't uttered a single scream as he was taken and Logan could imagine him still beating at his captor even now.
'What in the name of the White Dragon is going on?' the dragon farmer demanded loudly as he emerged from the shed.
'What are you doing in my farm?' 'And where is my son?' the king bellowed, looking amongst the tattered limbs of the tree.
He had obviously missed the abduction, which wasn't surprising as it had happened so fast.
Logan couldn't speak.
He felt numb and nauseous as he looked blankly at the king.
'I asked you a question boy!' the king said, turning red and stepping closer.
Logan raised the branch he was still holding and managed to point to the sky before his legs gave way and he collapsed to the ground.
Blackness closed in.
CHAPTER THREE - A SUMMONS
Logan woke up leaning against a tree trunk.
Alyxa was pressing a cool, wet cloth against his forehead and there was a lot of yelling nearby.
For a second Logan couldn't remember exactly where he was or what he was doing there.
When with a lurch of nausea he remembered, he paled as he realised he was sitting in the shadow of the tree.
Leaping up, and startling Alyxa, he threw himself out into the harsh sunlight.
'He can't be gone, he can't be gone,' the king was repeating, over and over.
He looked confused and upset, and was searching the sky as if he expected his son to drop back to the ground at any second.
'Send your dragons after him!'
Prince Myles wasn't confused; he was angry, and he was yelling at the dragon farmer.
'We don't have any dragons fast enough to follow, Your Highness.
We've tried before, but the red dragons are much quicker than greens or yellows.'
The dragon farmer was nervous and worried.
It was clear he thought the king would blame this all on him.
The dragonets were slowly coming back from the far end of the farm where they had run off to, and, after a quick look to make sure the sky was clear, they settled back down to their midday slumber.
The prince's newly charmed blue flew back into the enclosure and landed meekly right where it had torn its tether loose.
Myles noticed that Logan was awake and came storming over to him.
He stopped right in front of him and glared furiously.
'Why did you bring my brother here?' 'I didn't,' Logan answered honestly.
He pointed to the young prince's blue dragon who had settled down to resume its nap.
'He came here on his own.' 'And you just stood there and let the dragon take him away?'
Prince Myles accused bluntly.
Logan didn't have time to defend himself -- as Alyxa had stepped in to help.
She pushed her way between them and pointed at Logan's cuts and scrapes and then at the splintered branch he was still holding.
'I'd say he did the best anyone could.
Would you take on a fully grown red dragon?'
Alyxa's fury shone in her eyes as she endeavoured to keep her voice at a normal level.
'I didn't see you rushing out here to save your brother.' 'If I had known Erik was here--' Myles retorted, but the king had gathered his wits and came striding over.
'Enough!' he spat angrily.
He glared from Alyxa to Logan and then turned to the dragon farmer.
'We must mount a rescue to fetch Erik.' 'Nobody knows where the red dragons live, Your Majesty,' the dragon farmer replied hesitantly.
'We think they come from the mountains.
We have asked many times for a search party...'
The dragon farmer let the rest of his answer fade away as the king frowned at him.
Many times people had petitioned the king, requesting blue dragons to go in search of missing children, but the king had denied their requests every time.
King Aemon considered the loss of a few peasants not enough reason to risk the lives of his precious blue dragons.
'Come, Myles, we will return to the castle.
A search is to be made as soon as possible.
We must find the red dragons.'
The king's face set into a stony, emotionless expression.
'Bring Erik's dragon.'
The king strode over to the newly charmed blue dragon, untied its reins from the stake and threw himself onto its back.
With a jerk of the leather straps that wrapped around the dragon's throat, the blue leapt into the sky, almost as quickly as the red dragon had done.
A heavy silence followed as the prince fetched his younger brother's dragon and mounted it.
He glared angrily at Logan, obviously convinced that it was all his fault, then jerked cruelly on the riding straps.
The smaller blue dragon leapt obediently into the air and flew quickly off towards the city.
'I should be going,' Logan said quietly to Alyxa as the dragon farmer watched the two blue dragons flying off.
'Come see me later.'
Logan began to walk off slowly, hoping the dragon farmer would not think to ask why he had been there in the first place, but Alyxa's father spun around and frowned at him.
'I've told you before not to come into the farm,' he said bluntly.
'I... umm...'
Logan tried to come up with a reason that the farmer would believe, but his mind was blank.
'Get out of my farm!
I don't want to see you near here ever again,' the farmer snapped.
When he turned to his daughter, the threat of more trouble was clear in his voice.
'We'll talk back at the house.'
Logan shot a sympathetic look at his friend and backed quickly out of the farm.
He wanted to run away from there as fast as he could, but it was too hot and his legs still felt a little unsteady.
He couldn't help brief glances skyward even though he knew that the red dragons never returned the same day.
Today had been far too close.
He wondered where the dragon had taken the young prince.
It should have been him;; he owed the prince his life, but he would never get to repay that debt.
Nobody ever came back once the red dragons took them.
The crunch of his thin-soled boots on the salted path made Logan blink back to the present, and he saw the slightly bent figure of the old wizard through the open door.
Zared's long white hair was swept back tidily and he was smiling as he walked toward Logan.
He was carrying a broom and he shook his head in confusion.
'How did so much salt get spilt out here?'
Zared mused, not looking as though he expected an answer as he began to sweep the salt off the path.
'Oh, I cleaned up a little mess in the workroom.
Did you have a spell go wrong today?' 'Yeah, it was supposed to be a white rose,' Logan said with a small smile.
There was no point in reminding the old man what had happened earlier, he wouldn't remember in an hour or two anyway.
The wizard seemed quite lucid right now and his eyes were clear and bright.
Logan bit his tongue to stop himself telling what had just happened at the dragon farm.
There was no point in upsetting the wizard.
They didn't discuss dragons -- ever -- and Logan had come to realise long ago that it was one of the things that triggered off the old man's lapses.
'I'll show you how to do it later if you like,' Zared offered, then began to whistle as he swept.
Logan didn't reply, as something on the edge of his vision had caught his attention.
Off in the distance, way over above the city, he saw half a dozen blue dragons lifting off in a group.
They headed towards the white-capped mountains at a speed that confirmed they were off hunting the red dragons.
