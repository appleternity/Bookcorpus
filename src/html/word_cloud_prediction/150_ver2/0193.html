Mark almost choked at Tarsier`s words.
"You are slavers captain, pirates, thieves, raiders and probably murderers, you are lucky that I have not taken the easy way out and turned off the oxygen flowing in to your prison cell, if the situation was reversed, you would have already done just that."
Mark replied just as angrily.
"In fact, Captain, why not assist us by repairing the sabotage carried out by you to the Ion drive upgrade."
Tarsier looked at Mark sardonically and replied.
"Captain Blazer, as I have already told you, it is impossible to repair the damage with what you have available here on the Jupiter Express.
Why not accept that and return to Ganymede, rescue would then be only a few days away, after I had made the call to my people?"
"Sorry Captain, but the uniform of a slave would not suit me, I have a better option that I might yet resort to, I might start to shoot your crew, I am certain that one of them would agree to assist us, for they are only pirates, slavers, and loyalty to any cause has never been in their make-up."
Mark replied and he laughed as he left the pirates to think over his parting words.
**********
One month had crawled by on their return voyage to Earth, everyone was tired, irritable and wishing that the next nine months would pass at a faster rate than they currently were.
It was bathroom duty time again and Peter and Rob were on duty.
Peter stood at the top of the ladder waiting for Tarsier to arrive and Rob and Jean stood outside of hold number one ensuring that Tarsier climbed up not down to engineering or environmental, where he would attempt to sabotage the ship, once again.
Tarsier reached the residential level and climbed off the ladder on to the deck, he stumbled, Peter foolishly put out a hand to assist Tarsier and had his energy weapon wrenched from his hand.
Tarsier smiled grimly at Peter, put the nasty end of the weapon just inches from Peter`s head and asked.
"Where is your captain, tell me quickly and I will not kill you, hesitate and after killing you I will kill all of your crew, or die trying?
From this distance, even the lowest setting that you have this weapon set to, will kill you."
"Kill my friend, Captain, and I will kill you, then I will switch off the air supply in hold number one, your entire crew will die because you made a grave error of judgment."
Mark said at the entrance to his cabin.
Mark had returned here to collect some notes that Jean had made regarding the alien computer, once again he was attempting to discover its secrets.
Tarsier froze; however, he kept his finger on the trigger of his energy weapon, turning his head slightly he said.
"We have a stalemate captain, however, if you promise to return my crew and myself to our Ganymede base, then I will hand your engineer his weapon back."
"That would mean slavery for us, because the Xavier, or a starship much like it, would catch us up well before we reached Earth.
No, Captain, I have a better idea."
Mark replied.
Tarsier looked at Mark, his mind racing, his finger inadvertently moving off the trigger of his weapon.
"A better idea Captain, and what might that be."
Tarsier asked curiously.
"Well, Captain, it seems that I must give you something, if I am to stop you from killing my friend."
This was as far as Mark got, for opposite him and behind Tarsier, Rob stood silently on a rung of the ladder, waiting his best opportunity.
As soon as he saw Tarsier`s grip on his weapon`s trigger loosen, as Tarsier listened eagerly to Mark, Rob fired his own weapon at the same instance that Peter jerked himself away from the alien captain, ducking his head at the same moment.
The energy bolt whistled noisily across the short distance and took out Tarsier immediately.
However, Tarsier`s hand still jerked down on to the trigger of his weapon, firing it, its energy bolt striking the ceiling of the residential level, but the damage was only superficial.
On the floor below, Jean called up frantically.
"Rob, what happened, is everyone all right?"
"Everyone is fine Jean, except for Tarsier who will have a bad headache when he wakes up."
Rob replied as he hauled himself up on to the residential level.
"I am sorry Mark, he stumbled against me and I simply attempted to help him."
Peter cried out as his fingers explored his hair in fear that some of it had been shaved off.
"You`re tired, we all are, in hindsight it was an obvious attempt waiting to happen."
Mark replied.
"We need to assure that it does not happen again, does anyone have any ideas?"
Mark asked.
"Well let`s see."
Jean began.
"We can kill them, that would solve the problem, we could keep them short of oxygen, that would keep them weak.
We do have some drugs, not enough to keep them docile for nine months, but enough for one month, maybe.
Other than that, we will just have to be more careful."
Jean`s suggestions had lifted their spirits and on thinking the matter over, Mark said.
"More careful it is them, we can keep your other suggestions in mind, but only as a last resort."
Tarsier woke up to see four energy weapons pointed at his head, he shrugged and then said.
"Can I use the bathroom, I could do with a pee and a wash."
Mark smiled at the slaver and led the way, with Peter following behind him, his weapon aimed at the slaver`s back.
**********
Two months in to the return voyage, and Mark tried, once more, to get in to the alien computer, however, he could not find a program that would allow him to read it in the English language.
He knew that to obtain the most out of the information contained within it, it would need Jean Warrior and the scientists of Blazer Space back on Earth.
It was then that Peter came up to the bridge to speak to a very lonely Mark Blazer, for the others had been very busy in engineering since the voyage home had begun.
"Mark, we think that we have done it.
Yes, it is a mess, and certainly not the nice neat job that the aliens managed, but then we do not have that much material available to use.
However, using parts from what was left of the radio, one of the energy weapons and our entire stock of spare parts, we should be ready to test the upgrade to the Ion drive by tomorrow morning."
"That is great Peter, give the others my congratulations" Mark said adding.
"If your upgrade is successful Peter, we should reach Earth in six weeks, which will put us in to the record books."
Mark declared happily.
"It will also be a smack in the mouth for the aliens."
The upgrade was successful, and their alien prisoners looked at one another anxiously as they felt the Jupiter Express surge forward.
Six weeks later, in the early morning, the Jupiter Express turned around and used their Ion drive together with the liquid fuel engines to decelerate, and two weeks after that they were approaching the American space station.
They had been away from it for six and a half months, and Mark could visualise the excitement there, on seeing the Jupiter Express returning home, early.
Especially after hearing nothing from them for so long, he smiled as he used their thrusters to manoeuvre the massive spaceship up to the space dock.
When they opened their main airlock, which was on the accommodation level, they were met by a mixed group; however, the marines with their stun weapons stood out amongst the others, until Colonel Rick Jameson, the commander of the space station, saw Mark.
"Mark, what on Earth happened out there, are you all okay?"
"Yes Rick, although we had an interesting journey to Jupiter and back."
Mark replied and smiled when he saw the puzzled expression appear on his friend's face.
"I will explain in your office Rick, however, first I have some very important prisoners that I need you to put under a high security guard."
Adding swiftly as Rick`s gaze moved quizzically to Peter, Jean and Rob.
"No Rick, not my crew."
He said chuckling.
"We had some uninvited guests who hijacked my ship, thankfully we managed to turn the tables on them and return home.
Rick, they must be considered dangerous and we cannot allow them to escape, I will tell you more Rick, once we are in your office."
Jameson looked at Mark quizzically and said.
"You have had an exciting voyage Mark; just how many uninvited guests have you got and where have you stowed them?"
"Seven of them, they are in the number one hold, unfortunately you will have to bring them up to this level using the emergency ladder, and under guard at all times, that Rick, I cannot stress too much."
Jameson looked quizzically at Mark before sending his marines down to collect their prisoners, Rob accompanying them to input the code in to the keypad.
Later, when the crew of the space station saw the aliens, they were stunned, they finally knew what happened to the missing scientists from Marduh, they were hijackers.
Tarsier and his crew were taken to a quarantine area and held there under guard, to await whoever was put in charge of them.
Mark and his crew accompanied Jameson to his office and told him of their trip, of the hijacking, their winning back of their spaceship, and of the advances in technology that they had gained from the hardware that the aliens had brought aboard the Jupiter Express.
"You're kidding me Mark; you mean to tell me that the first aliens that I get to meet are space pirates?"
Jameson asked.
"Not only pirates, they are also slave traders, the people of Earth have been lucky, we now have advanced notice of their peoples' intentions for us and we can make plans to counter them."
Mark replied.
"I had better contact the authorities about this, they will not believe it, however, once they see your alien hardware they will have to believe it."
Jameson said.
The next twenty-four hours were hectic, with an order coming from the White House forbidding anyone on the space station from mentioning anything about the aliens or the voyage of the Jupiter Express.
This was followed by an order from the Pentagon ordering Mark and his crew to stay on the space station.
They were to await General Jack Dance and members of his staff, who would shortly arrive there along with another squad of marines, and Marlene Houston, who was the deputy director of the DIA, that is the Defence Intelligence Agency.
They came in two shuttles, one of which left immediately with the aliens on board, guarded by the squad of marines to ensure they arrived safely at a high security base in Middle America.
Here the aliens were imprisoned below ground in three secure cells to await agents of both the FBI and the DIA, who would interrogate them.
On the space station, and after a second debriefing, this time carried out by General Jack Dance and Marlene Houston, Mark and his crew escorted Dance and Houston, together with the scientists who had accompanied them, aboard the Jupiter Express.
Here they were able to view the alien technology; however, only the energy weapons looked impressive, as they could test fire them.
The computer was simply a box with a fancy display screen, as for the Ion drive upgrade, it had been patched up with an assortment of spare parts and it looked nothing like a most important piece of advanced space technology.
Mark and the others were moved to the Kennedy Space Centre, and the next morning they were sitting in the headquarters building.
Here they spoke with a Dance and Houston again, as well as some of the country`s leading scientists.
They talked well in to the night, as they went over all that they had learned about the aliens, their technology and what they intended for the people of Earth.
Then Mark mentioned the Pacifier, and all that it could do.
It was this weapon more than anything else worried the assembled group.
Finally, Mark mentioned the alien starship Xavier, of its recent trip to Earth, and of its chameleon stealth mode of operation.
Worried by what they had just heard, it was decided that the crew of the American space station be brought back to Earth for a full medical and psychiatric check-up.
The battered remnants of the Pacifier were handed over to an elderly scientist, who had top-level clearance, was brilliant, and worked exclusively for the pentagon.
However, Mark made it clear that the other alien technology, which was now on Earth, and in his laboratory at Cape Canaveral, was the property of Blazer Space.
Dance initially agreed to this, however, he had despatched a company of marines to ensure that it was not moved elsewhere or stolen by the agents of another country.
The government realised just how important it was, not for use against aliens from space, but to ensure that America was safe against its use on them by their enemies on Earth.
**********
At the White House, the president spoke with his cabinet, the subject, whether they should notify the leaders of the permanent members of the UN Security Council.
They comprised of the EU, which was reborn again and this time as one united nation, the UK, China, Russia, Japan and India.
If so should they to tell them everything?
That they now had proof that an advanced alien civilisation existed, and that they had visited Earth.
About the presence of seven alien prisoners, of the aliens` intensions, of the Pacifier, of the alien starship the Xavier, and finally whether to tell them of the alien technology now in the hands of Blazer Space.
It was finally decided that in the interests of the people of Earth, that everything should be disclosed.
Then all he had to do was to decide whether to reveal this information to the leaders of the Democratic Party, and then there were the senior members of his own Republican Party to consider, the president felt a migraine coming on, he could always resign, he supposed.
Initially this disclosure was met with disbelief by some of the parties that had been notified, however, they were invited to meet the alien prisoners and inspect the remains of the Pacifier.
Finally, they accepted that America had told them the truth, and a meeting of these permanent members of the UN Security Council was scheduled for the coming week, to give the leaders of the nations` time to discuss the situation with their advisors.
The first thing that they agreed upon was that the crews of the other space stations should be immediately brought back to Earth, to be checked by the leading psychiatrists of the countries who had people aboard the stations, they would also have to check past crews, ones who had recently returned to Earth.
The next thing that was decided by the Security Council was that the rest of the world was not yet ready to hear of this new threat to its people, it would cause far too much panic.
**********
When everyone had gone their ways, except for the marines who now guarded his offices and laboratory, Mark called his crew together to speak to them.
"Jean, we have a lot of important work ahead of us, and I want you to head the team."
Jean was a little stunned, but he ignored her surprised look and continued.
"We must commence the initial research on a larger version of the alien`s energy weapon, I want one fitted to the Jupiter Express and powered by its nuclear reactor.
On a smaller scale, we need to start production of the hand-held energy weapons.
Finally, I want you to look at the device that upgraded our Ion Drive, one with more than just one setting.
If we can travel around the solar system at anything approaching half a G, it will be good enough for most people."
Mark declared in barely concealed excitement.
Mark then looked at Peter and Rob.
"Jean will need your help; your recent experience with alien technology makes you both important to the swift completion of all three projects.
Is everyone okay with this?"
"No problem Mark, there are more women down here than on the space station."
Peter replied with a grin.
"Sounds good to me as well Mark."
Rob agreed smiling, for he agreed with Peter.
"Good, then can you start tomorrow morning?"
Mark added to which they all agreed and then he said.
"A trio of generals from the pentagon are coming to see us tomorrow morning, I will bring them through to your laboratory Jean, I want you all there to meet them and then to run through everything with them.
It is important to Blazer Space and to us three, and not just financially, because after our last adventure we are now the leading space exploration team on Earth, and I intend to keep us ahead of the rest.
The other space faring countries are going to want to play catch up, I do not want them to catch us, I want us to stay number one, that way the best opportunities, whatever they are, will come our way."
"You can count on us Mark."
Peter said for all the others.
"I like the idea of being famous."
Mark and the others immediately laughed and beat him around the head with their baseball hats, they needed to let off steam now, tomorrow they would have to listen to generals, politicians and their lackies.
The planned meeting the next day went well, with the Pentagon promising to invest a substantial sum in to the three projects, if some of their scientists could participate.
They also demanded substantial discounts on the subsequent technology designed by the Blazer Space science team.
This Mark agreed to, he really did not have much choice, he needed their money and scientists.
