NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.  E.g., in the Temperature or Location_of_light frames:  'I can never bake anything in my oven because it 's too hot.' 'She gave him a really bright flashlight for Christmas.'"}, {'frame': 'Undergo_change', 'tfidf': 1.1574486734679201, 'lexical_unit': 'changeable.a / change.n / veer.v', 'definition': "An Entity changes, either in its category membership, its situation, or in terms of the quality of an Attribute. In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'  'My life instantly changed from an empty life, to a life full of joy and purpose.'  'As you can see, the word WALK changed from red to green rather than have a separate lens for each colour.'  'My feet turned to stone.'  'The promise will turn to ashes if progress is not made.'  'The price  changed from $1.26 to $1.27 per pint. DNI'  'At least one relative instruction has changed in size from short to long.'  In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.  'The nation was crawling towards oblivion.' 'We were walking past almost reasonable and heading right for what-the-bleep.' "}];

I've heard of him," Dave said, thinking.
"And that's uncommon for someone of Glix.
He's that guy that the Space Chicken accused me of being."
'I've said too much.' "No, you need to tell me right now," Dave said sternly.
'It's just some guy.' "Why does David Gratton keep coming up?
What are the chances of me coming all this way and hearing more of David Gratton again?
What's he got to do with me?"
'He did a lot, that's all.
In David Gratton's life, he went a lot of places, gave a lot of talks, opened a lot of buildings, that's why you keep hearing of him.
He's no-one important.' "He's very important, clearly.
Why else would the Space Chicken care if I were him?"
'Try to forget about David Gratton.
There's nothing you can do.' "But it concerns my future.
What happens to David Gratton will change my life."
'Not really.' "Don't lie to me.
I know you well enough to tell when you're lying."
'And I know you well enough to tell that you needn't worry about David Gratton.'
Dave gave up.
All his attempts at anything seemed to result in failure and humiliation.
"We're going to find the Oak Tree."
Chapter 16 "Don't you think you're being a bit extreme?"
Quack asked down the phone.
"But You said he's evil," the Space Chicken countered.
"That's not really evidence to go on, is it?"
The Space Chicken was flabbergasted.
"But You said that.
And You're omniscient."
"Semiscient, I think you'll find," Quack said, straightening his metaphorical tie.
"Which means I'm unreliable.
Some of the time.
I'm sometimes wrong.
At least if I were wrong all the time, I'd be consistent.
That would be useful.
But I'm not."
"How would Your being wrong all the time be useful?"
"Because you'd always know what was right."
"How?"
"Because it would always be the opposite of what I said."
The Space Chicken put the phone down.
Any sort of illogical logic was fairly distressing, but pious inconsistencies could be infuriating, which meant they imperatively were.
"Can I go now?"
asked Michael Rowland Daffodil, a possible criminal.
But only in the future.
"No," the Space Chicken said.
"But I will remove your hand-wingcuffs, provided you stay in the car."
"What are you talking about?"
asked Michael Rowland Daffodil.
"You haven't got a car."
"I will have soon enough.
I'll also open the window slightly so you can get some cool air."
The Space Chicken walked up to a sailor who was standing by the side of the river Prong.
After leaving the train, with his wing cuffed to Michael Rowland Daffodil's wrist, the Space Chicken and Fred Jr, his son, had wandered around for a while, hoping to find the their prize, which was sitting in the major river of Gord.
"Excuse me," the Space Chicken excused, "but you look like a man wizened to the ways of the water.
Would you might helping me?"
"What do you want?"
"I'm looking to retrieve a holy grail.
It shouldn't be too much of a trying task."
"It's always me," the sailor grumbled.
"Listen, darlin', this God or god hasn't spurken to you.
You haven't been sent on some mission or owt by 'Im, so just farget abaht it."
"Look at me.
I have been sent on a mission.
I'm not like the other nutters who pass through here.
I'm a different nutter."
The sailor looked at him.
"Do Ah knoo yous from somewhare?"
the sailor said to the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack.
"Do you know who I am?"
"Oh, yeah.
You're that one as told us the world were gonna end."
He chuckled, though out of stubbornness, arrogance and antipathy, not out of humour.
A difficult laugh to pull off, but the trained mariner achieved it.
"You're the Paternal-" "No, I'm not!"
the Space Chicken squawked.
More calmly, he added, "I'm the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack."
"Ah, reeght," he said, both of them well aware that the sailor didn't know the difference.
"In that case, Ah can get yer hahly greel fer yiz."
The sailor used a variety of levers, pulleys, nets and rods to retrieve the grail.
Soon afterwards, the Space Chicken, Fred Jr and Michael Rowland Daffodil wound up in Gary's Vehicles, celestial treasure in wing.
Arriving there, they were promptly struck by how the majority of the interior of the shop was taken up by the gargantuan Spaceboat.
The Space Chicken found Gary, and, exchanging the aforementioned valuables, was entitled to take the Spaceboat.
Things were just about beginning to match up.
Chapter 17 "Clint?"
"Clein?"
"Are we going anywhere?"
"Yes."
"Where?"
"We're going to the Fez, of course."
"Yes, but are we actually going anywhere?"
"We're going Nekken, if that's what you're asking.
I checked a proper compass this time."
"You know what I mean."
"No, I don't."
"You can't pull that lie on me."
"Of course I know what you mean!
Do you think there's a chance in Tartarus I could fail to understand you?!"
"Clint," Clein said.
"We both know we're both thinking it.
Are we really going anywhere?
Do we really need to follow the Fez again?"
"Look, it's just what we felt like doing.
Some people feel like going to university.
We didn't, because we knew something else would come up.
This is it.
The Fez is a different path we can take."
The Space Chicken and Fred Jr drew up in the Speedvan.
"This might help your journey to go a bit more quickly."
"Space Chicken!"
the twins exclaimed in unison.
"Don't ask how I got this Speedvan back from Oprah.
I'm suffering from quite a lot of timelag as it is and I don't need a headache on top of that."
"Thank you," Clint said, clambering into the car.
"Now drive us to the Fez."
"What?"
"I said, 'Now drive us to the Fez.'" "What are you talking about?"
Clein explained, "He said--" "Yes, I know what he said."
The Space Chicken was beginning to get rather irritated.
'You may need to explain in greater detail.' "Fred Jr thinks you may need to explain in greater detail."
"Yes, we can hear him too," Clint said.
"And you decided to call him 'Fred Jr'?
Hm, interesting."
Clein said, "I didn't know you were called 'Fred'."
"That's beside the point!"
the Space Chicken calmly and politely explained.
"When I said, 'What?'
I was clearly mistaken in pre-empting your interpretation."
Clint and Clein stared at him blankly.
"What I had meant to say was, "Don't you dare think for a minute that I'm going to drive you to BongVe Bong.'
There wasn't meant to be much room for your interpretation."
"Space Chicken," said Clein, "please," said Clein, "could you," said Clein, "drive us up to BongVe Bong?
Please."
"No." 'Dad, you must help them.
All we shall be doing anyway is wandering around.
We have no proposed destination; we may as well help our friends.' "All right," the Space Chicken agreed.
"Get in, if you must," he said to Clint and Clein.
It seemed they must, for they clambered into the back of the Speedvan without a second thought.
"Um...
Space Chicken?"
Clein said.
"Yes."
"There's another man in the car with us."
"Ah, yes," the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack said very calmly.
"I have taken him hostage.
I did so at divine request."
"Has Quack actually asked you to take him hostage?"
"Well, no." Clint gasped.
"Have you gone beyond Quack?
Have you spoken to-- to God?
Does God exist?"
"No." "God doesn't exist?
