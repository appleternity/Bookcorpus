'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.

Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

There was a pen with a dirty-looking string duct taped to its top that secured it to the board.
"I just need your signature right here," he said as he pointed to the line on the green form that was affixed to the front of the letter.
I made a mental note to be sure to wash my hands first thing; no telling how many germs were on that pen.
Once I signed, he tore the form off along the perforations.
"Then he handed me my letter and slipped the green form with my proof of delivery signature into an envelope taped to the clipboard.
"You have a good day now," he offered cheerfully and headed to his truck.
He got back in, and though my door was closed now, I could tell when he stepped on the gas.
My eyes turned to the upper left corner of the envelope.
"The Bank of Louisville?"
I checked the address line.
Sure enough, it was addressed to "Ms. Ellery S. Mayne."
"Huh."
I went to the kitchen to open it.
First I washed up.
Then I opened the knife drawer.
It was one of my many and oddball pet peeves to see people (well, primarily my mother) rip open and destroy perfectly good envelopes when it was so much neater to just use a letter opener.
We didn't have a letter opener, however, so I guess I could understand my mom's method, to an extent.
But we did have knives, and they worked remarkably well for this purpose.
Inside this intriguing envelope was a single sheet, more Bank of Louisville letterhead.
It notified me that a trust had been established in my name and that because I was now of legal age, I needed to meet with the trust administrator to discuss my rights and obligations.
Turning eighteen had more advantages than I anticipated.
It was signed by Dwight Matthews, Legal Counsel, Vice President, Trust Administration.
"Huh."
I picked up the phone and started dialing.
The number connected me with a pleasantly efficient-sounding assistant to Mr. Matthews.
I told her my name, and she put me through to him directly.
"Hello, Ms. Mayne.
Thank you for calling so promptly.
I'd like to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss your trust.
And I'm sure you have a number of questions for me."
He had a very friendly and relaxed manner, which put me at ease.
"Uh ... yes, sir ...
I suppose I do."
He didn't know it, but I was still cruising in shy mode.
"Well, that's completely understandable.
Now, how soon can you meet with me?"
he asked.
"Um ...
I'm available today, but I don't drive," I informed on myself.
He chuckled a little, no doubt at my greedy enthusiasm, and said, "Oh, that's not a problem.
I can send a car for you if you'd like."
Although this had the feel of legitimacy, I decided to use common sense and some caution.
After all, how hard would it be to fake some important stationery and use my own greed against me to lure me in?
I certainly didn't want a repeat of the "perfume" incident, though it might be interesting to see who would rescue me this time.
"No, that's okay.
I can get a ride.
What time should I meet you?"
I countered.
"I've got an opening from noon to two o'clock today.
I was going to order in some lunch for my staff today.
You can join us, if you'd like, then we can talk after that," he offered, putting me at ease again.
Mr.
Matthews had a really nice-sounding voice.
If he looked anything like he sounded, he would be very handsome.
I agreed, and he gave me detailed directions to his downtown office on Broadway, as well as his direct line in case I got lost.
I thought about calling Hoyt and asking him to drive me down there, and then maybe we could stop over and see Mom at the library afterward.
Hoyt could come and go from work as he pleased unless he had a specific meeting on his schedule.
He was always pleasantly willing to help me out on spur-of-the-moment chauffeuring requests.
And that was even before I became so mental.
Now he and Mom both practically tripped over each other to comply whenever I asked to be taken somewhere, which, admittedly, was rare these days.
But then my thoughts took a different tack.
This business about my being of legal age must have started a mental ball rolling up there.
It seemed as if this was something I should go and see to all by myself.
There was only about an hour and a half until noon.
A game plan began to take shape in my mind.
I hopped in for a quick shower.
Then I blow dried and fussed with my hair until it was perfectly smooth and twisted into a braid down my back.
I decided that this occasion called for better clothes than what was available in my closet, so I picked out an ensemble of my mom's that had looked great on her.
Once I had that all in place, I decided that I was going to have to put on some makeup, too.
Since I didn't have any of my own, I picked through her cosmetics drawer until I had made the amateurish improvements I thought I required.
Then I did something very grown up--something I'd never done before--I called a taxi.
I felt absolutely ridiculous wearing a hat, but at the same time I didn't think I could pull off the outfit without it.
It looked best with the hat, I assured myself, and I purposely turned the volume down on the internal critical commentary that was beginning to sound alarmingly like an episode of What Not to Wear.
Besides, a hat helped to obscure and offset my extremely youthful face and hairstyle; in fact, that had been the point of the whole ensemble and the motive for raiding Mom's closet in the first place.
I pulled out five twenties from the stash in my dresser, not certain what it cost to be driven back and forth downtown, and wished that I would have gotten my license two years ago like a normal teenager.
I even had a perfectly good Jeep waiting for me in the garage!
Well, it was too late to lament my stunted development today.
It was unusually mild, probably after so much rain this week, so I spent the last few moments on our front porch anticipating the arrival of the taxi, stepping out into the sunshine to warm up a little.
As I lifted my face to the warm rays of the sun, I had to smile when I thought about my mom's expression if she saw me at this moment, especially dressed in her outfit and then riding away in a taxi.
Just then the taxi pulled in, and I moved off the porch and out to the drive, hopping in the back, only to face more uncertainty.
"You headin' to Churchill Downs?"
asked the driver, an older man who apparently was retired from his stint in the band ZZ Top.
If I could have chosen my own taxi in which to ride, based on the appearance of the driver, this one would not have made the cut.
It was a clear case of pognophobia (fear of beards).
"No.
Downtown.
Five hundred Broadway, please."
He shrugged, as if disappointed, and backed the car out of the driveway.
I smiled to myself when, as we were getting on the highway, he turned his music back up, and sure enough, "Legs" was vibrating out of the speakers.
The ride downtown went fast.
I wondered what my watchers were making of this.
It was completely off the charts as far as activity went for me.
I'd purposely stayed out of sight in the beginning, self-conscious about being observed and certain my awkward embarrassment would tip them off that I knew I was being surveilled.
Unfortunately, they didn't give up because I was boring, and cabin fever finally won out over stage fright.
It occurred to me that since they had saved my life, I probably owed it to them to be a little more interesting.
That being the case, I enjoyed a bit of satisfaction thinking that today's adventure would have multiple benefits.
Chapter 7   
Mr. Matthews was heavy and very tall--an absolute giant of a person.
He had a pleasant face, but he wasn't as handsome as his voice.
He and his assistant were clearly expecting my mom or some other custodian to appear from around the corner, if their repeated glances behind me were any indication.
Then, wishing to settle the matter, I suppose, Mr. Matthews asked, "Uh, Miss Mayne, are you here alone?"
Suddenly, being independent and seeing to things on my own felt like a bad choice.
But I wanted to speak for myself, and I knew that would never happen unless I was by myself.
"Yes, sir," I replied, trying not to sound nervous, but failing.
"Oh, it's not a problem, I just ... well, I expected your mother to be here too, but I'll provide you with a copy of all the documentation.
You can share it with her later, if you like."
"Thank you," I answered quietly.
We'll have to see about that.
Being vertically challenged as I was, even normal people seemed tall to me.
But when this man stood next to his assistant and several other members of his department while they made up their plates of catered lunch food, it was clear that he was big, perhaps the biggest person I had ever encountered.
I followed him along the table, where a full spread from a barbecue place had been set up.
Containers of pulled pork, coleslaw, corn pudding, baked beans, and ten different flavors of barbecue sauce filled up the surface area.
I hadn't eaten all day, but my nervousness in a foreign environment filled with curious strangers suppressed my appetite.
As a result, I dumped a mostly untouched sample platter into the garbage when lunch was over.
In contrast, the plastic cup full of ice and Cherry Coke was completely empty when I pitched that.
After lunch, Mr. Matthews (Dwight, as I was instructed to address him) guided me to a leather chair inside his office, a place where clues about his past fit perfectly with his body size.
There was an impressive collection of Ohio State University football memorabilia crammed into every available square inch of wall and desk space.
The sense of collegiate affiliation-based kinship washed over me like a warm breeze.
Dwight was a big old Buckeye and a former national title winning offensive linesman.
My grandpa had been a Buckeye, too.
This shed light on the latter's selection process as it related to the handling of his estate.
I never did absorb his love for college football, but time spent in Grandpa's company had transformed me into a very enthusiastic fan of the OSU marching band.
I was hooked from the first time I saw them perform their famous "Script Ohio" routine, this amazing marching formation of the word Ohio in script style.
Even though from the stands it seemed like a small detail, what I loved most was that a tuba player got to be the dot of the I, and he gyrated and danced in the most diverting way.
It seemed like a person who would choose to play tuba wouldn't be such an exhibitionist.
I loved the unexpected nature of the contrast I found in that.
One of our season ticket-holding neighbors said the guy was a dentistry student named Steve.
I don't know why, but that made it even funnier to me.
You could purchase the band's recordings (tuba solos and all), and Grandpa had set me up with an admirable collection, once he'd ascertained my more than cursory interest there.
I liked to think that I was the only person in the world who listened to the OSU marching band on my iPod.
A large photograph of the Script Ohio scene took up most of the wall above the credenza behind Dwight's desk, and I gazed at it for some time, taking a mental journey back to one fall day in Columbus.
I was at a home game with my OSU alumni grandfather, the first huge sporting event I had ever attended.
It was awesome.
Over the blasts of music from the band and the roar of the crowd, Grandpa yelled in my ear, explaining what was happening and pointing things out, like the extremely small visiting team's fan section of wimpy, hopelessly outnumbered outsiders dressed in blue, completely surrounded by an army in red.
The Buckeyes won, of course, and afterward I was fascinated by the singular experience of walking among a huge throng of such happy, satisfied people.
Thank goodness for the win.
On our three-hour drive home from Columbus to Louisville that day, Grandpa and I fell easily into conversation about the game and the stadium and the band and his days as a geology student at OSU.
It was funny to think of him as ever having been young.
He'd had white hair since long before I was born.
He never acted old, though.
Even as we flew down I-71, passing every other vehicle as if they were going backward, he seemed youthful in his enthusiasm for life and adventure.
It made his comments all the more anomalous (jarring).
"You know, Ellery, I'm getting up there in years.
It's hard to say how much time I have left, though I know it isn't nearly enough.
Lately I've been thinking about what I need to do to make sure that you're taken care of when I'm gone," he said as he glanced over at me before turning his attention back to the road.
"Well, that's very nice of you, but two things.
One, you're as healthy as a horse, and two,  I was planning on taking care of myself.
I may look like my mom, but I'd like to think that's where the similarities end."
I didn't like this topic, as my snappish response must have clearly demonstrated.
He chuckled and then sighed.
