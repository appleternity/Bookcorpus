This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

'' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

They had noticed them in front of them walking up in the direction of the castle, but no one had seen them since, and now they seemed to have utterly disappeared from sight.
"What are those two after?"
asked Val Sinclair.
"They seem ever so keen on each other's company today!"
"I think they always are," said Don.
"My brother Jack and Doris have been chums ever since they were small.
We have a photo of them at home.
You should see it -- two little babies sitting side by side in a pram with their arms round each other, and looking at each other with the most sentimental grin."
"Who took it?"
asked Val. "Doris's father.
He used to photograph every holiday.
He hasn't taken a single one this year.
Getting too old, he says.
I do wish we had that photo of Jack and Doris here.
There they are, those two, smirking at each other like two little lovebirds!
We call it 'The Young Lovers.'" "Is that why they're together this afternoon?"
asked Val.
"I shouldn't wonder.
I don't mind if it is," said Don.
"She's a jolly girl is Doris Somerville -- always the same, you know, and she's just the one for Jack.
He tells her about his work and that sort of thing, and she knows how to look after old women and sick people, and all the rest of it."
"I think Jack's just splendid," added Billy.
Don laughed.
"So he is, though I says it as shouldn't, as Jack's old landlady would say.
He's a regular brick in the pulpit and out of it.
But he's not a bit too good for Doris, I'll say that."
"She seems pretty fond of him," said Val.
"I should just think she is," replied Don.
"If you want Jack's praises sung, go to Doris.
She'll let you have them right enough.
I run him down sometimes, just to tease her, and don't I catch it!"
Forester never spoke a word, but he was listening most attentively to the whole of this conversation.
Not a single word was lost on him.
How blind he must have been not to have noticed this before.
Everyone else had seen it, and of course they were right in the conclusions they had drawn.
Jack and Doris were exactly suited to each other in every way.
How foolish he had been!
He had imagined that Doris liked to be with him, and that she had enjoyed those quiet mornings on the shore as much as he had done.
But now he felt that all the time she must have thought him a terrible nuisance, and must have been longing for Jack to come and take his place.
Forester recognized that if there was one thing that he held in abhorrence more than another, it was going anywhere where he was not wanted.
Jack and Doris did not appear until teatime, and then gave a lame account of their proceedings.
Oh yes, they went to the castle, but there was not much to see there after all.
So they went on the hill beyond, and lost their way in the wood.
Val winked at Jack's brother Don.
"What a pity you found it again," he said.
"We could have had no end of fun looking for you, and might have found you wandering like the babes in the wood."
Doris laughed, such a light-hearted laugh, Forester thought, as she told them that she and Jack had enjoyed a pleasant afternoon in spite of being lost.
Tea was a welcome meal, and everyone did full justice to it, including the large birthday cake covered with icing and sugar-plums, with a broad inner layer of almond paste.
The cake bore the lettering in pink sugar on the top of it -- Many Happy Returns of the Day.
Then came the walk home along the shore, during which no one appeared to be in better spirits than Norman Forester.
He never flagged the whole way, and there seemed to be no end to his jokes, his amusing stories, and his power of repartee.
It was not until he had said goodnight to them all, and had pinned his bit of white heather onto Joyce Sinclair's dress as he gave her a kiss and told her to be sure to ask him to her birthday party next year, for it was the nicest he had ever been to in his life; it was not until he had left the castle behind and found himself out on the lonely headland, with only the quiet stars shining above him; it was not until then that he dared to pause and look into his own heart.
During the last few weeks he had enjoyed himself, from day to day, in a way in which he had never done before.
He had delighted in Doris's company; he had interested himself in finding out her thoughts and ideas on various subjects; he had contrasted her with someone else whom he had known, and marvelled at the difference.
He had gone on from day to day in a kind of happy dream, never asking himself where all this was leading him, never stopping to call his feelings by the right name, never looking into the future at all; but just enjoying to the full the happy present in which he was living.
But since he had left his tent that morning his eyes had been opened.
As he threw himself down on the heather that warm night he had no difficulty in reading his own heart.
He loved her.
Oh, how he loved her.
He had thought once that he knew what love was, but now he discovered that he had never really loved anyone before.
Certainly he had always felt a certain amount of affection, admiration for a pretty face and charming manner, and a longing to escape from the solitude of bachelor life and settle down to the quiet home life.
He'd had all this, and thought that the kind of love in story books was not a reality.
He had imagined that his ideal did not exist, that she was not to be found in this faulty world, and that therefore he must be content with the nearest approach to that ideal that he could discover.
But he had never known what real love was.
He knew tonight.
Yes, he had found his ideal.
Doris Somerville was everything of which he'd ever dreamed; she was more than he had ever pictured to himself.
Yes, he had found her, but she was not for him.
She was Jack's ideal too.
Jack loved her, and had probably loved her long, long before he came on the scene.
Dear old Jack, so thoroughly worthy of her -- such a contrast to himself.
Jack, who was always the same, utterly free from the moods to which he knew that he himself was liable -- Jack, so good, so strong, so true.
Surely he could never stand in Jack's way after everything Jack had done for him, even if it had been possible for him to do so.
Jack deserved her, and he was the one to make Doris happy.
Who was he that he should complain?
He would wish them God-speed in the bright future which lay before them.
He would rejoice in their joy, even though it meant his own loss.
But not tonight, no.
Just for tonight he must think of himself, and of the sorrow that had come upon him.
He had not cried since he was a boy, he had not shed a single tear on that day, not long ago, when he discovered how he'd been deceived.
He'd been angry then -- disappointed, annoyed, depressed; but he had never cried.
Yet now the hot, scalding tears came, in spite of all his efforts to keep them back.
There was no sleep that night.
He was a man of strong feelings, and his whole nature was stirred.
He did not even attempt to go to bed.
He paced about the headland.
He even climbed down to the rocks and sat for the last time on the spot where he and Doris had sat so often together while she painted.
Jack would be the one to see that picture finished.
He must now return to London.
When he was busy with his patients, or going round the wards in the hospital and doing what he could to lessen pain, to cure disease, and bring comfort and help to others, he would feel stronger and better.
Yes, he would get back at once.
He would write to Mrs. Timmis tomorrow.
His old housekeeper was having a holiday in the country, but he would ask her to return at once and have all in readiness for him.
This was Thursday -- at least, yesterday was.
It was early morning now.
He would write today, Friday.
Mrs.
Timmis would get the letter on Saturday, but not in time to get back that day, for she was in an out-of-the-world place.
She would not be able to get off until Monday morning, but he could catch the night train and be back in his rooms early on Tuesday.
That would give him time to get his tent down and pack it up.
He settled it all in his mind, to the smallest detail, even to the wording of his letter to Mrs. Timmis -- anything to occupy his thoughts sufficiently to get through the next three days.
But with my God to guide my way, 'tis equal joy to go or stay.
What made those words flash into his mind just as he returned to his tent?
They seemed to bring a strange untold comfort with them.
He was going away on Monday, but he would not go alone.
Jesus his Guide would go before him, and go with him.
And in his busy life, in his weary, constant fight with disease and death, in the quiet hours of his solitary life, he would never again be alone.
The Son of God had loved him and died for him, and He would be there with him, even unto the end.
Chapter Eleven A Meeting Disturbed WHEN seven o'clock came, and he felt that the long night of conflict was over, Norman Forester wearily took up his towel and set off to the shore to bathe as usual.
When he made up his mind to any course of action, nothing on earth would move him from it.
He had resolved the night before that no one should ever have any idea of what had been in his mind, or of the struggle he had gone through to obliterate his own wishes and only think of the happiness of his friends.
He knew that he was now facing three days of great difficulty, and he could not help wishing that they were over.
The Sinclair brothers were not up.
He threw pebbles at Val's window at the castle, and shouted underneath it, but got no answer.
He guessed that no noise would have waked Val that morning, for the long day in the open air had almost certainly made him sleep soundly.
Forester went on alone.
He was sorry that the Sinclairs were not coming to bathe, for he rather dreaded being alone with Jack and Don Mainwaring.
He thought Don might have something to tell him that morning about Jack and Doris, and he did not feel quite sure of himself yet.
He was afraid that his congratulations would not sound as warm and hearty as he would like them to do.
However, to his relief, not a word was said on the subject which he had supposed was uppermost in their minds by either of the Mainwaring boys.
The sea was calm, and the long swim was refreshing after his sleepless night.
Forester, refusing a pressing invitation to breakfast with the Mainwarings at the Bank, climbed the hill again, feeling far better able to face the day -- a day which could not fail to be a trying one.
Later that morning he avoided his usual short cut to the shore.
He pictured Doris Somerville on the rock busy with her picture.
She must not know, she must never know, what his thoughts had been as he sat there in the darkness only a few hours before.
How thankful he was that he had never in any way led her to suspect his feelings.
If he had done so, she would have been troubled and sorry for him.
Her eyes would have been full of sympathy for him, and it would have brought a shadow over her happiness.
He was glad, very glad, that she would never know.
On the way down the hill he met Don's sister Dolly.
She looked bright and pretty in her pale blue motor cap and linen dress -- like a harebell, he thought.
She told him that she and her sister Mab were going with her brother Don and the Sinclair boys for a long walk in the woods at the other side of the bay, and she asked if he could come with them.
"Is Jack going?"
he asked.
"No, he is going to prepare his sermon."
"Going to read it to Doris Somerville, perhaps," he thought, but aloud he said, "I'd be delighted."
During the walk everyone was in such good spirits that he found it infectious, and soon joined in all the merriment.
The views from the hill were lovely, for they looked through long vistas of trees to the blue bay beyond, and saw the woods on the other side, with Hildick Castle and the old church standing exactly where an artist would have placed them in a beautiful picture woven out of his own imagination.
"Next week," said Don, "we'll have another picnic.
I vote we have heaps more before we go home.
Mother says she thinks Monday would be a good day.
So don't forget, any of you, and fix up anything else."
"I'm afraid I won't not be with you," said Forester.
"I'm off home on Monday."
"Nonsense," said Don.
"Surely you told me you were going to stay longer than that."
"Yes, but I find now I have to get back to work, and when duty calls ... you know."
"Bother duty calling," said Don.
"Don't go yet, there's a good fellow.
We're such a jolly party here, and it will spoil it all if we begin to break up."
