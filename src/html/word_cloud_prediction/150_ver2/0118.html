The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

She finished her last play four years ago in the number one spot and hasn't been seen or heard from since.
That would be an incredible opportunity!"
"Then let's plan for that interview to kick off your press tour.
Quick but busy for the next few weeks, starting as soon as we find out when you're eligible to go back in." Zack's Patron stood up and walked towards the door.
"I've got to get out of here.
Lots of work to do, and Kyle is on his way up to check on you."
"When will we meet again?"
Zack asked his Patron.
"As soon as possible.
The face-to-face meetings are difficult at the moment, but we can keep in touch electronically, as always.
I'm very proud of you, Zack.
If you retire as number one, I will make good on the reward you asked for when we first met.
I have to admit it was a silly boy's request all those years ago, but nothing would make me prouder than to officially give you my surname."
Zack grinned.
"Zack Strayne...
I've always liked the sound of that, Brandon."
Chapter 5 "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Strayne."
The female reporter shook hands with Brandon before sitting down across from him on the television studio soundstage.
She was your typical television interviewer; pretty face, heavy with makeup that looked ridiculous in real life but helped her appear normal on camera.
Dark rimmed glasses to help announce her intelligence to viewers.
Striking blue eyes, black hair cut in a cute pixie style.
Perfect white teeth and a charming smile.
She was dressed in a dark and professional business suit, the knee length skirt revealing her tanned, shapely legs which were crossed properly at the ankles.
Brandon guessed that she was single and looking for a rich husband; the single reporters often competed for the opportunity to interview and impress the world's richest bachelor.
"Please, call me Brandon," he replied.
"Do you mind if I call you Lisa?
Or would you prefer Miss Rohansen?"
"I would prefer other things from you, Brandon."
She flashed a comfortable, seductive smile, her eyes looking him up and down appreciatively.
It took effort not to laugh at her obvious attempt to engage him.
"I would be happy if you'd call me Lisa.
Thanks again for agreeing to do this interview.
Have they told you how the program is scheduled to play out?"
Brandon nodded his head.
"You're going to play some old footage that explains the Game, why I came up with it, the history of its rise in popularity, covering some key points throughout.
Then you're going to talk to me about Zack and his chances for retiring at the top.
Does that sound about right?"
Lisa smiled pleasantly.
"Sounds exactly right.
It's a fluff piece, really, Brandon.
You're paying for it, so none of us intend to ask uncomfortable or difficult questions about the Game.
We are going to try and help you build a following for Zack, or should I say, increase his already incredible fan base."
Brandon chuckled.
"Thanks, Lisa.
Zack definitely leads the pack in fans.
His following has been huge for years now.
This is a rare occasion, though, and it deserves special attention."
The intro music started in the studio, the stage went dark, and both Brandon and Lisa turned their attention to a large screen which opened the show.
The deep, soothing voice of a male narrator began to give the history of The Game:  'Thirty years ago, the education system was in ruins and the average person suffered from an overall lack of motivation to live in the real world.
Multiple generations of video gaming had put society in a dangerous crisis.
Adults who had spent their entire lives sitting in front of computers also allowed their children to do the same.
Middle and lower class workers were plagued with physical and mental health sicknesses that come from eating poorly, not exercising, and interacting less and less with their fellow man.
The upper class recognized the problem but they were unable to solve it.
The middle class all but disappeared and the lower class was in serious danger.
Historical experts of today look back on that period and agree; civilization was on a collision course with extinction.
Then a man came along who changed everything.
Brandon Strayne, the only son of the world's wealthiest computer developer, joined a small company named VirtDyne.
VirtDyne had invented Functional Virtual, the ability to send a person's consciousness into cyberspace.
However, they were unable to bring a person out of it, and after the deaths of several test volunteers, they had no choice but to give up and shut down the company.
Brandon Strayne heard about VirtDyne's problems and approached them with a proposal.
If he could solve their issues and save their company, they agreed to give Brandon a 51 percent controlling interest in the company.
In a short time, Brandon was able to fix VirtDyne's problems, making it possible to safely be put into, and brought out of, virtual reality.
VirtDyne celebrated his success by quickly transferring majority ownership over to Brandon.
With true virtual reality now --pardon the play on words -- a reality, every major and minor company in the world got in line with trillions of dollars in hand, hoping to harness this new technology to gain competitive advantage in their markets.
Brandon had different plans for his new technology, however, and he quickly announced that there would be only one virtual reality product, developed and controlled entirely by VirtDyne.
Not long afterward, he introduced the product to the world.
Brandon called it 'The Game.'
The death spiral of society was the problem, and Brandon was pleased to announce that The Game was going to be the solution.
Schools and current teaching models had been in place for centuries, but they were no longer effective.
With the approval of the government, children would now go to school by playing The Game.
Simulations have always been an effective method for training, enabling students to learn safely before being put into real life situations.
They have always been viewed as a valuable way to teach.
Pilots, surgeons, soldiers, and many other professions have excelled over the years, thanks to simulation training.
The Game was designed to be the ultimate in simulation training -- a virtual reality life simulation, where children would start off first as simple organisms and then progress in complexity with each play, as they aged and mastered the basics of the Game, to more evolved characters, known as "avatars."
Each play of the Game would be a lifetime, some short, some long.
Time would be measured differently inside the computer simulation for players, allowing them to live decades in the Game while only a short time would pass in reality.
The Game would be every child's new school.
At the age of five, each student would enter the Game free of charge for their first five plays.
A credit system was created so that students would accumulate credits as they moved through their virtual lifetimes.
The credits earned would be deposited into their own account at the end of their play.
The first five plays would be free and then the child would use credits from their account to buy into new plays.
Some children would not accumulate enough credits to buy new plays, which would result in them dropping out of the Game.Dropouts would attend old style public schools if they were still young enough to live with their parents; if they were older than 14, the students would attend government run institutions, where they would be trained for labour and simple jobs which would available to them upon reaching the age of 18.
Over time, students would earn enough credits from living as simple organisms so that they could purchase the ability to play as humans.
This was the higher purpose for developing the Game and where the real learning would occur.
Understanding what a person can learn from just one lifetime, imagine living five or even ten lifetimes, all before turning 18!
There is a saying that "youth is wasted on the young," which is true in many ways.
With the Game, a young person could become an adult with lifetimes of wisdom in their psyche already.
It was an incredible opportunity, and the Game as a replacement for traditional schooling was accepted by every country in record time.
All countries quickly agreed to let small test groups participate in the Game.
The results were overwhelmingly positive, and in just a few short years, the Game was the primary method for teaching children worldwide.
That was a generation ago, and although a few virtual reality products have been slowly developed and introduced, VirtDyne owns them all, and each product revolves around what has become the world's greatest obsession...
The Game.'
Chapter 6 The television monitor faded to black and the studio lights blazed to life.
Lisa smiled and began her interview.
"The 18th of next month marks the 30th anniversary of The Big Bang, the term that VirtDyne uses to describe the activation of the computer simulation that gave birth to the virtual universe of the Game. Mr. Brandon Strayne joins us live tonight to discuss the festivities surrounding the anniversary, and also to talk about one of the most exciting players currently in the Game and the excitement being generated over his final play.
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Strayne."
"Please, Lisa," Brandon said, "Call me Brandon."
Lisa returned his smile, a slight blush working its way through her makeup.
She was definitely picturing herself as his new girlfriend after the taping.
It took all of his control not to laugh out loud at her eagerness.
Maybe he would take her out for dinner.
"Thank you, Brandon.
First let me ask you what's on everyone's mind lately.
Are there going to be special events taking place inside the Game, and, if so, can you share any of the details?"
"Well Lisa, I don't want to ruin any surprises...
I can say that there are going to be many special events inside the Game this year to celebrate its 30-year anniversary.
Some will be obvious to viewers; many will not be.
As I've already admitted, none of the programming is mine, and I'm going to be as surprised and excited as everyone else over the next year.
I'm especially excited to see if my young benefactor can pull off a spectacular and incredibly rare feat, ending his final play in the Game as the number one player in the world."
"Yes, let's talk about that.
Zack was nowhere near the top when he began his last reincarnation, yet when he died he had solidly landed the number two rank.
What do you say to those critics out there who will claim he only did so well because he has you for his Patron?"
Brandon laughed softly.
"I would say these people have no idea what the Game is or how it's played, Lisa.
First of all, Zack was reincarnated ranked 752.
When you look at the world rankings of millions of currently active players, 752 is in the top ranks.
Secondly, check the history over the last twenty-nine years; I have, and you'll see jumps much more drastic than what Zack just experienced.
It might seem like a big leap, but the first hundred thousand players can jump around and capture top ten ranking spots if they have a good life inside the Game."
"You're exactly right, Brandon."
Lisa said.
She then went on to describe a set of graphs being displayed to the audience showing many large swings in ranks over the years, identifying the specific players who had experienced them.
When she was done detailing the graphs, Brandon continued with his defence.
"If people still continue to claim that I'm somehow helping Zack from outside of the Game, let me assure you that it's impossible.
The code and expense and massive shifting in the virtual timeline, as well as the billions, if not trillions of individuals that would be adversely affected in the Game, ensures that such a thing never happens.
Over the years, hackers have tried to get into, and influence, the Game.
Only the Games Masters can do so, and the exhaustive time and effort required to make even the smallest change to the virtual universe is so complicated that tampering like you are suggesting could never happen.
Twelve Games Masters are required to work together to make a change."
Brandon leaned forward.
"It's simply not something that would be possible, Lisa.
The Games Masters take their responsibility too seriously to be corrupted, let alone all twelve of them falling prey to greed.The Game won't let even the Games Masters interfere too much.
They are called on very rarely and with all their effort they can affect only the smallest of changes.
No, Lisa, what happens in the Game is unscripted and uncontrolled by anyone outside of it.
Part of what makes the Game so incredible is that when left on its own, the Mainframe creates events better than we could possibly come up with ourselves."
The issue addressed and resolved, Lisa brought the conversation back to the hot topic at hand.
"Can he do it, Brandon?"
she asked.
"Can Zack be one of the few to finish his last play ranked number one?
Or will he take the safe way out and just coast through to ensure he retires from the Game as a very, very wealthy individual in reality?"
"Well, only he can know for certain, Lisa."
Brandon said with a boyish grin, "But if I were to bet on this Game, then I'd bet he's going to go for it.
Of course, I know a few very wealthy people who are putting their life savings on him not going for it.
So we'll all just have to wait and see and hope that he gives us an incredible farewell show.
If you want to try and figure it out for yourself, be sure to see his interview with Angelica later this week."
Lisa's jaw dropped.
"The Angelica?"
she asked.
"The last player to do exactly what we're hoping Zack can do?She captured the number one spot on her last play and it was so incredible that replays and Firsting sales of her last incarnation are still best sellers, four years after the event!
No one's seen her since her victory tour."
"That's her, all right," Brandon nodded.
"I imagine there will be a turnout for that program."
