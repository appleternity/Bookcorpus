This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions.

'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

He could do a lot worse", Gio finally said.
Ben relented.
After all he didn't want to make a big deal about it to begin with.
Chapter 11 Back to 1994
The sun was well up over the horizon now and warming the back deck of Sam's house.
The pink and orange tint in the sky gave way to a pale blue.
Why did all those memories of Tina come rushing back so easy?
It was as if it was yesterday.
Sam took a sip of his coffee.
It had gotten cold.
Time for a refill.
Opening the wood framed glass door that entered the kitchen, he headed for the coffee pot.
He'd put off going into work today.
There wasn't anything pressing going on.
He walked to the window and looked out again into the distance.
He'd come a long way and experienced a lot of life since he left Tina, much of it fulfilling...some a waste.
In most circles, he'd be considered successful.
Years ago that was a very important goal.
In recent years it wasn't.
He had seen much of the country, lived in some beautiful places, built nice homes, and bought and sold his share of toys.
The last few years became a time of contemplation.
None of it really made him happy.
Comfortable?
Yes.
But, he remained lonely...maybe empty was a better word.
Since he split from the dragon lady 10 years ago, Sam was leery of getting involved again.
That mistake taught him a permanent lesson.
You don't go away for a vacation in the Caribbean, spend it partying, and come home with someone you barely knew except when they were out of their bikini.
Blaming it on youth gave him some solace.
But here he was again, involved with another woman, a different kind of woman.
Lynda had been wonderful companionship since arriving in Durango.
You couldn't call them an item, but they saw each other a fair amount.
The rumor mill hadn't started, yet.
Easy going and peaceful were the two things that came to Sam's mind when describing Lynda.
Sometimes conversation came easy.
Other times, there was none...just comfort.
On those days when work got a bit stressful or very busy, he always found some reason to drop by to see if she wanted company.
After being in her space for just 15 minutes, the world had a gentler tone to it.
She stirred feelings in him that he hadn't had in so many years.
He actually was considering fatherhood every now then, as painful as it was sometimes to think about.
But, maybe Lynda was just the thing to slay the demons.
How would he feel being the father at a high school graduation at 60?
He didn't know.
She never pressed him on it.
It was just like her.
She was the most satisfying relationship he had known in many, many years.
The ringing phone startled him.
"Hello....Oh, good morning, Lynda.
I was just thinking of you.
Yeah, it was good."
Chapter 12 Meeting Lynda
Sam had only been in Killington, Vermont a little over three years when the call came from Allen Collins wanting him to come manage his resort in Durango, Colorado.
Sam had enjoyed living in Vermont.
In so many ways, it was a world away from the rest of America.
He loved the old colonial towns, the quaint shops run by 3rd generation shopkeepers, the sugar shacks that sold the maple syrup products, and the beautiful fall foliage.
He knew that eventually he'd make his way back west.
That's where his roots were and he was a 'westerner' at heart.
He loved the big open expanses that only the West could provide.
Sam had been to Durango often enough in the past to know he'd be happy living in the area.
So, in the late spring of 1993 he once again packed up his car and moved.
Even though he had done it many times in the past, there was one drawback of moving that Sam always disliked.
That was setting up new bank accounts, post office boxes or addresses, getting a new driver's license, and finding car insurance.
He usually set aside one whole day for doing those tedious errands in an effort to get them out of the way all at once.
It was 2:30 in the afternoon on a beautiful May day.
Sam had finished everything except getting car insurance.
He had had State Farm for many years, so he looked up the local agent the night before.
The office was actually a converted Victorian home right off of Main Avenue in downtown Durango.
It had probably been renovated in the last 5 years based on its fine condition.
The construction was solid, and the outside had been painted in a variety of beautiful pastel colors popular for Victorian renovations.
Sam entered into a large room, which was probably the living room of the original house.
It contained two desks opposite of each other and another office in the back of the room that was separated from the main office by glass walls.
The right desk was unoccupied at the moment.
A young lady was at the other desk.
She was on the phone, but immediately acknowledged him with a big, warm smile.
She raised her index finger and mouthed, "Just a minute" and then pointed to a couple of chairs and a small table with the customary magazines.
The office was obviously furnished by someone with a love of the outdoors.
The walls were decorated with a variety of large photographs.
They included a sunrise over some high mountain peaks, Monument Valley in the winter under an incredibly blue sky, and one of a large Aspen grove golden in the fall foliage.
Sam walked over to the chairs.
Before sitting down he looked at the photograph above the chairs.
It was a picture of a couple of wolves looking out through some trees in the pine forest.
Wolves always captivated him.
Maybe it was his love of dogs.
Yet, somehow he always felt a bit guilty.
He knew the controversy about replacing wolves back into the wild of the "lower 48".
Many people, mostly ranchers, wanted nothing to do with these creatures.
They probably had some legitimate reasons.
However, in Sam's mind it wasn't up to man to make that kind of judgment.
God must have put them on earth for a good reason, he reasoned.
"It looks as if you like that picture?"
As Sam turned, the young woman was standing within a few feet of him, her hands clasped in front of her.
Smiling she said, "Hi, I'm Lynda Gregory."
Extending her hand.
She was quite lovely...maybe thirty.
The thing that struck Sam the most was how serene she appeared to be.
She was of medium height...about 5'5".
She had straight, dark hair down to her waist.
Woven into her hair was a couple of feathers with some beautiful strands of beads.
She was wearing a satin, purple shirt with a tan, suede vest and broomstick skirt.
Topping off the outfit were a pair of suede cowboy boots.
He wasn't sure, but she looked part Native Indian.
He turned towards her, smiled, and extended his hand, "Hello, Lynda.
My name is Sam Morino."
Pointing back at the picture he said, "Yeah, I do like that picture.
I don't know if it's politically correct since this is ranching country, but I've always loved looking at wolves.
I find them mystical and magical at the same time."
She smiled that warm smile again.
Well, you might like this.
She turned a bit towards her desk.
"Lobo...come here, boy."
Just then, two furry ears appeared from behind her desk.
As it came loping out from behind the desk, Sam first thought it was a wolf.
Then, he realized it must be an Alaskan Malamute.
This one was the tall, lanky type with shorter hair rather than the stouter, longhaired breed.
Lobo came right up to Lynda wagging his tail.
She knelt down to him and he began licking her face."
"He's beautiful...a Malamute?"
asked Sam.
"Yes, that's my pretty boy."
Bending over, Sam extended his hand for Lobo to smell.
"He looks friendly enough."
As Lobo was sniffing Sam, Lynda said, "He's a big softy, except with other dogs."
Lobo took to Sam immediately.
He loved people, while barely tolerable of other dogs.
Lynda noted their immediate connection.
"I bet you didn't come in to talk about wolves and dogs.
Can I help you?"
"I just moved in from out of state and I'm going to need car insurance."
Motioning to a chair next to her desk, she said, "Why don't you sit down here."
As she walked back to her desk chair and sat down, Lobo followed her and laid down nearby.
Turning her attention towards her computer keyboard.
She started to type a bit while looking at her monitor.
"How many people will there be on the policy?"
Lynda always liked asking this question especially when she was asking an attractive, polite guy.
It was a professional way to find out if he was single.
Sam sat down, grinning at the loyal dog nearby.
"Just myself", he answered.
"Okay then, and your mailing address."
"P.O. Box 8383, Durango."
"Oh, that's a good number!"
she said with hint of excitement.
Smiling, Sam said, "It is?"
Chuckling, she said "Sorry...it's a thing I have with numbers.
