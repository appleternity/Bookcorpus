In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}];

                        <pre id="story_content">
I am here to see someone named Anet.
Surely you must have heard that I was coming?"
The woman's expression turned to incredulity and then a slow realization seemed to settle on her face.
"Well woman, what will it be?
Will I be made to sit out here all day in the hot sun?"
He snapped.
"Oh no, no!
Come in, come in!"
Ilim was relieved.
He was very tired.
She ushered him inside and down the hall.
"Mother Berenice has told us of this moment!"
"Where is she?
I must speak with her."
"She has not arrived back.
She is on a mission-journey and the sisters are late.
We were expecting them back several days ago but we have not seen them."
"What about the girl?"
"Anet is with them.
They were in Zapulia last I heard.
But we got message that the Hatchet Men, ever thorns in our sides, were seeking to kill them and they had to go by sea."
Ilim grunted in dismay.
The Hatchet Men were one more black mark on the temple.
He hated them.
Thieves, idlers and murderers put to use by the Ainash.
"Hatchet Men!
A curse on them!
The women up there," he motioned to the ceiling, "are they there because of them?"
"Yes.
We always have to be vigilant against them."
"So they had to go by ship, you say?"
"Yes.
We have not heard from them since.
God be good to them, they will be safe where ever they are."
"I perceive they must be making their way here and not lost.
I had a vision and I was told to come here to seek the child, to train her."
"What vision, my brother?"
"I have been given a sign and a commission.
I must denounce the Ainash in the city of Jhis, where the great temple is.
God has left them.
This child will be important in God's purpose in removing corruption and evil in the land."
"Denounce the Ainash?
You are the Ilim, the one who creates trouble for them?"
"I am.
I do not know whether I shall survive this commission but we will see.
What is your name?"
"Ava.
I make and mend the clothes and tend the looms here in the fortress.
I am sorry but I have been talking too much.
Come and let me show you the sleeping quarters.
Mother Berenice arranged a separate small house near the gardens for you.
I shall have someone bring fresh water and food.
Come!"
The woman chattered on endlessly it seemed to Ilim and it took all his patience not to snap at her again but finally she brought him to his quarters and left and he set about making himself at home.
It was a one room house, solid enough, built of unmortared stone with a small fire pit for warming and cooking, a long sturdy table, a chair and a small bed with some rough blankets and one window covered by a thick, worn tapestry.
On the table there was a small supply of candles wrapped in cloth and tied with a strip of cotton and a wide, shallow, fired-clay vessel filled with water.
He immediately rolled up his garment and washed his arms and hands and then he put the vessel on the ground and washed his feet.
In a dark little corner he heard the rustling of mice.
There was a strong, musty, old smell to the house which signaled to him that it had been a very long time since anyone had resided in it.
It made him think on his commission.
It was an age since a message had been brought to the people of Hybron.
The land was rotten with corruption and like this house, had to be swept clean.
He wondered how he would tell his message to the people.
It would not be a message anyone wanted to hear but he had no intention of shrinking back.
He also wondered what this child was like.
He had never mentored a girl, only boys and men, being as they were smarter and could learn faster.
Everyone knew this.
Yet, if God said that she was his next one to train, that was that.
Ilim had found many things strange recently.
The very atmosphere of the land was charged with destiny.
Prophecy was on everyone's lips, whether they looked forward to it or feared it.
He looked to the future as a distant but bright star in the night.
He wanted that light to shine upon the whole red world.
Others wanted to hide from it or stamp it out.
He used to wonder why Khalit had not been the one to bring about the new era.
Now he was bringing in a new queen, one from a strange culture.
Would this child really come from her?
It chilled him, briefly.
Ilim was still unhappy over the fact that the Divine Purpose would not be worked out between Khalit and Diti.
In his mind, she was a most excellent woman.
There could be none better.
He sighed and wandered outside.
The sun's waning light still held on to dusk but the stars were peeking through the sky and it was turning from soft violet to blue-black.
From his little hill on the citadel grounds he could see a small herd of sheep settling down in their stone pen for the night.
The little houses dotted the town between gardens, workshops and roads.
A wild dog barked somewhere far away.
Ilim plucked a few long grasses and began chewing them.
The Festival of Firsts would be upon the land soon.
People from many places near and far would be traveling to Jhis.
Some would travel to the citadel instead.
He saw that the women were busy making preparations for this very occasion.
A figure was approaching a small distance away.
One of the older girls of the temple.
She was carrying a large bundle of firewood.
She was paler than most of the women in the citadel with jet black hair and black almond shaped-eyes.
He called to her.
"My daughter!"
"Yes?
I am sorry, who are you?"
"I am Ilim.
I am here to see Mother Berenice, when she arrives."
"Oh, yes.
Greetings to you, my father."
"What is your name, child?"
"Irtal."
"What sort of name is that?"
"I am from the north.
Where the sands turn to ice and snow and the dunes to mounds.
My name means 'waiting'.
"A beautiful name.
It would seem we all are waiting for something to happen."
"Yes, father."
Said Irtal.
"I wonder, my child, do many people come here for the Festival of Firsts?"
"People in Gamina come here instead of traveling to Jhis.
Or it used to be that way.
But lately we have noticed more people from far away coming here instead of traveling to Jhis.
Once we even had a dear family travel all the way from Egi.
They refused to even enter Jhis."
"Did they say why?"
"The Ainash have made it more difficult for the people.
Especially for foreigners.
They offend the people.
I remember hearing once from a man who had come here with his family for the festival that in order to even enter the temple they had to have many coppers or some gold or silver and if they did not they had to stand at the foregate for most of the festival.
Not once were they allowed into the temple for the deep readings and instructions nor for prayers in the morning and night nor the healing pools.
They could only attend the public Morning and Night Prayers in the main courtyard.
The temple is the heritage of all those who worship God but it has been taken from us.
I hear that those who refuse to pay the new temple tax are now being punished with death."
"Ai!
What?
I have not heard so!"
"You have been away for a long time, father.
Many things can happen in a few weeks.
We have birds that bring messages from everywhere so that we might know what is happening in the land.
The Ainash have made it punishable by death not to pay it.
Many of the people, of course, cannot pay.
It is a way, I suspect, for them to winnow out the poor from the temple.
Those who are unable to pay, it is said are being sent to the arenas to be torn apart in the games - for the king's wedding celebrations."
Ilim was aghast.
"Who was this letter from?"
He finally said when he recovered.
"From the Lady Diti.
But do not let anyone in Gamina hear you call her "lady".
She is still the only true queen as far as they see it."
"Blessed be Lady Diti, but has no one said anything in their defense?"
Cried Ilim.
"She found out through one of the priests loyal to the old ways."
He knew immediately who it was.
"Also, Lady Diti has caused a controversy in the city.
She went wearing clothes of mourning, fasting and weeping and sitting herself in the marketplace in front of all the people.
