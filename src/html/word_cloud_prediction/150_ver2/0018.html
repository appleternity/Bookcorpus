There is only one lexical unit, go.v, that evokes this frame directly in English, and it combines only with a limited set of Final_quality types, such as undesirability (bad, sour), insanity (crazy), inability (limp), or posture (prone).  However, the frame itself is intended to cover situations with arbitrary Final_quality types.  As such, frames describing simple state change should inherit from this frame, incorporating the Final_quality FE as part of the background meaning of the frame."}, {'frame': 'Cause_motion', 'tfidf': 1.2301331758499146, 'lexical_unit': 'launch.v / hit.v / throw.v', 'definition': 'An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

And then, finally, I turned and walked out.
**** Somehow, I made it all the way to San Diego, although I was in no shape to be driving.
I was still shaking, from anger, from fear, and my gut was twisted into knots.
Chase opened his front door as soon as he saw me pull up, smiling big as he waited on me.
"Hey, baby, I've been--" He didn't even get to finish, I shoved him aside, dropped my bag and headed straight for the bathroom, making it just barely in time.
My stomach heaved and I retched violently, purging everything that was or had ever been in my system.
When it finally stopped I just sat there with my forehead leaning against the toilet seat.
Chase was suddenly right there next to me, with a cold wash rag.
"Come on, baby, lift your head up," his voice was so soothing; I felt it wash through my bones.
I wanted to just curl up next to him and stay there forever.
Instead, I shoved his hand with the rag away.
I sat upright against the wall, and closed my eyes.
I felt two tears roll down my cheeks and I was too exhausted to even wipe them away.
"Adam, what's wrong?
Are you okay?"
So we sat there, on the floor of the bathroom and I told him everything, from the beginning--how Kowalski had been bothering me for a while now, what happened to him today and what happened after he came back to the barracks.
Chase settled next to me and wrapped his arms around me, and for the moment I let him.
"Jesus, baby.
That guy is a bigoted asshole.
I have some comments about how they managed to let someone like him into the Marines but I'll hold those.
I'm so, so sorry Adam."
I leaned out of his embrace and looked him in the eye.
"That's all you have to say?"
He didn't answer.
"Don't you even care that I had to make up some big huge lie and tell people that you were marrying my cousin?"
His voice was quiet.
"Did they believe you?"
"I don't know.
Most of them don't usually believe the filth that spews from Kowalski's mouth, so I think they would believe me."
He nodded his head.
"All right, then."
He started to get up.
"You really don't care?
You should be yelling and cursing and hitting me--anything.
You should be pissed off that not only have I shoved you in the closet but I have to lie about who you are."
He sighed and finally looked down at me.
"Adam, of course I'm not happy about it.
But I don't know any of these people, so I don't give a fuck what they think about me.
If it makes it easier for you, then tell 'em I'm married to three wives with a dozen kids.
Whatever will keep you safe and coming back to me.
That's all I care about."
Then he turned and walked out of the room.
**** The final blow happened two weeks later.
The word was that Kowalski had been reprimanded pretty severely for what had happened that day and he had thankfully been keeping his distance from me.
In fact he never said another word to me and I didn't even hear him joking around as much with the other guys.
Field training was finally over for everyone and of course the guys all wanted to go out and celebrate.
We went to this little dive bar just off base, and commandeered the big booth in the back, telling the waitress to keep the pitchers flowing.
There were several groups of single girls in the bar, so I knew it would only be a matter of time before the boys all started pairing off with whichever cutie was speaking to their dick that particular night.
As soon as that started happening, that was my cue to start acting drunk and then leave so I could head to Chase's.
There was one chick that was seated at the bar and as I walked by once from the bathroom, she stopped me and tried to strike up a conversation.
I was polite and chatted with her then took the number she gave me and shoved it in my pocket before heading back to the table.
The boys of course razzed me about the "hot chick I was talking to," and I laughed it off.
As I sat back down, I noticed Kowalski had suddenly shown up.
He didn't say anything, just kept looking at me in that smug-ass way of his.
Later, I wished I had just turned around and left right then.
An hour later and the night was progressing as I had predicted.
I was the only one left in our booth and I was just getting ready to leave when I saw Kowalski talking to the chick at the bar who had hit on me earlier.
He was nodding back to the booth and then she turned and looked back at me and smiled.
Shit.
Now I really had to get out of here, no telling what he was cooking up.
Except she was quicker than I was, because the next thing I new there she was sliding into the booth next to me.
"Thank you for the drink."
I blinked.
"Drink?"
She held up her glass and shook it.
"The nice guy at the bar said you bought it for me."
Then she sidled up to me even closer so our bodies were touching, squeezing me into the back of the booth.
"I thought I should come over and say thank you in person."
Her eyes were staring directly into mine.
Then she was practically climbing on top of me, shoving her lips on mine.
I could still see over her head and staring right at us with a sick smirk on his face was Kowalski.
Motherfucker was gonna sit there and watch the whole thing to see what I'd do.
My gut twisted at the sickness of this whole situation.
"Mmm, you're so hot," she breathed.
She was running her hand down my chest and heading straight for the promised land.
I realized I was trapped, literally and figuratively.
So I tried to shut my mind off and once again, play the God damned part.
I started kissing her back and she was sticking her tongue in my throat.
I ran my hands up her thighs, toward her practically nonexistent skirt, intending to just slip my fingers underneath the hem, to tease a little.
Unfortunately that just encouraged her to start grabbing for my crotch and my jeans were just loose enough that she got a hand down there before I could stop her.
I decided that now, I could be justified in getting her to stop, using the excuse of being in a public place.
Kowalski was still leering at us, but he had got his show.
After I got her hand out of my pants and told her we couldn't do that here, she just got more animated.
"Oh yes, let's get out of here, go somewhere a little more private."
She jumped up and grabbed my hand and I decided to just keep going with it.
The other guys saw us leaving and yelled out the typical lewd comments to us.
Once we got out the door and she got in my car, I told her I wasn't feeling good, but that I'd take her home.
She pouted and tried to get me to change my mind but I refused, so she finally went inside her house.
It was late, but I decided to just head straight for Chase's now.
It was just a couple miles to the highway and another mile to the first rest stop.
I pulled in and over to the last spot in the parking lot, got out and threw up in the bushes.
When I was done I got back in my truck and leaned my head on the steering wheel, trying to get my breathing under control.
I don't think it had been normal since that girl had slid into the booth with me.
What the hell had I just done?
I hadn't been with anyone since I started seeing Chase.
No one had kissed me, no one had touched me, certainly no one else had had their hand on my dick.
I felt violated, I felt like I had betrayed Chase, like I was cheating.
I mean it was all fake and it was with a girl and thank God nothing had gone any further.
But, Jesus Christ.
I had passed another test to prove I was a heterosexual, but at what cost?
I felt like shit, I was numb inside.
And it was going to be a never-ending process, there would always be more "tests," more insane play-acting.
And I didn't think I could do it anymore.
**** It was nearly two in the morning when I got to Chase's, but I didn't want to wake him yet, so I sat in the truck for a couple of hours and then went and parked myself on his front stoop.
I dozed off leaning my head against his door.
So, I was woken up when he finally opened the door.
"Baby, what are you doing down there.
Get up and come inside."
I stood but made no move to go inside.
"No."
"No?
But why not?"
"Because that will make it too hard."
My voice was hoarse and it cracked as I spoke.
The look on his face suddenly got very serious and I knew he was bracing for what was coming.
"I can't do this anymore."
"Adam--" "I want to be with you but it's killing me.
Do you know what I had to do tonight?
This time that damn Kowalski trapped me into making out with a girl.
She was kissing me and I had to kiss her back.
Her tongue was in my throat and her hand was on my dick."
And finally, I saw it there on his face.
The crushing reaction of realizing your lover had cheated on you, even if not sexually.
The idea, the picture of someone else's lips and hands on your lover's body--no matter the reason--was crushing.
He tried to get it together, to hide it but I had seen it.
And it broke my heart to know I did that to him.
"It's ... okay ... ."
His voice was barely a whisper as he tried to tell me what he usually says.
But I could see it was harder this time.
And it would keep getting harder until the day would come where he wouldn't be able to say it.
And I couldn't hang on until that day.
"Dammit, Chase, it's not okay!
And I've had enough."
"Adam, you just have to hang on a little longer--" "Don't tell me I can "hang on."
You weren't the one with some chick's hands down your pants trying to not throw up because all you can think of is how much this is going to kill your boyfriend.
"And all the constant watching and looking over my shoulder at work, wondering if this is gonna be the day someone finds out.
It's not worth it."
His face paled.
I looked in those beautiful blue-gray eyes I loved so much and they looked dull and lifeless as he spoke.
"It's not worth it.
You mean we're not worth it?"
I couldn't say it, so I just turned and walked back toward my truck.
"Adam--" I turned but kept walking backward.
"You said it in the beginning.
I don't do relationships.
Now you know why."
I got in the truck, backed up and drove away.
**** My chest hurt so bad I had to pull over to the side of the road; I almost thought I was having a heart attack.
I think it was really all those horrible things I said to Chase trying to kill me.
I didn't sleep at all that night, and then slept for ten hours, all through the entire next day.
