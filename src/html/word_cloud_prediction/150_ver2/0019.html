Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'

This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

"If you want, you can ride with Jimmy but he smells like them dogs, so maybe not."
He laughed and Jimmy told him to go fuck himself.
"Let's get this hunt going then."
The truck was a dual seat type so Anton offered to sit in the back so he could take photos along the way.
Rachel climbed in the front seat, which smelled of dried mud laced with horse dung and stale cigarette smoke.
Next to her in the seat was, after she took a closer look,  a night vision scope, military grade.
It was laying on top of a small stack of wilderness maps and an ordinary road atlas.
In the back seat she heard Anton rifling through his camera bag, as he finally selected another long focal lens and began attaching it to another camera back.
The driver, who had introduced himself hastily as they were getting in the truck, was humming to himself, while they headed up I17.
Sunrise was still a couple hours away and the darkness of the valley, where only a few stray sources of illumination in the distance lighted the way, penetrated all around them as they sped up the highway.
For some reason, she felt nervous and didn't really know why.
The whole situation made her uneasy.
It had been a long while since she went into the wilderness with anyone else.
Her research was almost always a solitary pursuit and she had grown to like it that way.
"Hollis," Anton said from the backseat, "how long is it gonna take to get to where we are going?"
"That's an open ended question," the driver replied, then laughed, continuing to hum to himself.
"Not enough variables for me to answer," Hollis said over his shoulder, adding, "if you no what I mean."
In the semi-darkness of the truck cab, Rachel and Anton exchanged looks, and she asked, "How did you decide where to start the hunt from?"
Hollis thought for a moment, reaching over to adjust the heat pouring into the cab and answered:  "Trade secret."
"A what?"
Anton asked, leaning forward in his seat.
"He said trade secret," Rachel interjected, trying not to get an edge to her voice.
Turning to Hollis, she stated:  "Three kill sites had to have made it difficult, huh."
"You might say that," he said, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel along with his humming.
"We'll get 'em," he then declared, effectively ending the conversation.
They drove on for another hour, while they left the paved highway and started down half graded forest roads.
Hollis stopped to consult a map and change into four wheel drive, consulting with his partner in the other truck on his cell phone for a moment.
They could hear the dogs barking when they stopped, sensing the hunt was about to begin.
Rachel had so many questions to ask but Hollis had essentially shut down all conversation.
She doubted she was going to have a discussion of any kind with them anyway.
She now knew that they had been thrust on the hunters and Hollis and Travis didn't agree with the arrangement.
Finally, after what seemed like a very long drive, they stopped.
The very first rays of sunlight were beginning to cascade over the mountain range along the rim.
It was cold, a typical early Spring day in the valley, that would eventually give way to a pleasantly warm day by afternoon.
Rachel didn't have any idea why they had selected this area to start the hunt.
It was miles away from any of the kill sites.
Admittedly, she didn't know much about hunting technique or habits but picking any location at random because it was within the range of a large cougar seemed counterproductive and almost guaranteed to bag the wrong animal.
"What's going on?"
Anton whispered to her when they had gotten out of the truck and were standing waiting to see what came next.
"I haven't been on many hunts before--actually none--but does this seem normal to you?"
Rachel looked around to make sure they couldn't overhear her, then replied, "Don't ask me.
I'm a biologist.
I'm all about saving wildlife.
All I know is these guys don't want us here.
I only hope this doesn't go from bad to worse."
"What do you mean by that?"
Anton wanted to know, as he doubled checked to see if they were in earshot.
"These are legitimate hunters--right?
I mean they do this for a living.
I saw their website--for what's that's worth.
It looked like they had tracked down plenty of cougars before.
Did you happen to see their website?
Borderline crazy.
People pay them for this experience."
Rachel snorted at his last comment and exclaimed, "They track down game with a pack of dogs.
Fox hunts in England were more humane."
"Ever driven an ATV before?"
Hollis suddenly asked, appearing out of the dark gloom like an aparition.
"Me?
Yeah, a couple times," Anton answered, looking at Rachel for a moment.
"Good, you drive one...take her with you...while I drive the other one," he explained.
"Travis is going to go up ahead with the dogs, pick up the scent, work it, then we will follow along after him.
Got that?"
"Got it," Anton told him, not able to come up with anything else to say.
"I'm gonna off load them now, so stand back," Hollis informed them.
"I don't want you guys to get hurt out here.
Damn it!
Listen, I gotta get you two to sign some release forms.
I got them in the truck.
Forgot to get you to do it back at the office."
"Already did that," Rachel told him.
"They were supposed to have been faxed to you by the county."
"Oh yeah, right.
Let me call Jeanie to see if she got them.
Hope she's up by now," Hollis mumbled to himself, as he tried to call on his cell phone.
He tried to dial out a few times but he kept losing the signal.
"Fuck this," he spat out, walking over to a small hill and walking up to a higher point.
They could see him silhouetted against the rising sun and hear him talking.
In the distance they could hear Travis shouting out commands, as a few of the dogs barked in response.
They could see him stopping here and there, as he trained his flashlight on the ground, checking for prints.
A cold breeze was blowing down the canyon, being sucked down towards the warmer air of the valley from the Flagstaff area.
It was an almost daily phenomenon, a reverse inversion, warmer air drawing down the colder layer from a higher altitude.
"I wish I'd brought my other lens," Anton complained aloud, as he held up one of his cameras, trying to gauge whether there was enough light to take a shot of Travis and the dogs scrambling up a nearby hillside.
"She got 'em," Hollis called out to them.
"Let me get the ATV's off the truck.
Looks like Travis is on to something already."
"Yeah, I bet," Rachel said under her breath.
After the ATV's were unloaded and Hollis had given Anton a quick primer on how to handle the vehicle, they mounted up, with the hunter in the lead.
"Easy does it," Hollis announced, staring at Anton.
"I don't want you drivin' up my ass--hear me?"
Anton snickered and replied, "I got it."
"Let Travis do his thing out there then we will catch up," Hollis told them.
"This might take some doing.
And we are gonna have to walk some too.
These things will only take us so far.
I hope you two got on good boots because you are gonna need 'em."
Rachel and Anton both looked down at their shoes, then at each other, laughing.
"North Face," she said, pointing at her hiking shoes.
"Vasque," he said, grinning.
"Top of the line."
"Really," she mused, laughing, "and so clean."
"Oh, they are supposed to get dirty, I didn't know that," he shot back, looking back down at his shoes, admiring.
They then heard Hollis' two way radio crackle to life and a garbled voice tell him the tracks lead towards the northwest.
Hollis walked over to his truck and pulled out a map, spreading it out on the hood of the truck.
There was barely enough light to read the print.
Shining his flashlight on the map, he traced his finger up and down a few times, grunting.
He spoke into the two way radio then checked with a GPS device.
"Hope you like mountain climbing," he declared, grinning at them.
"This road here will take us only up so far.
It's an old mining road that is--at least the last time I was out here, caving in three quarters of the way up that away."
He pointed off in a vague direction.
"We ride as far as it'll take us then bushwhack the rest of the way.
Travis is already on to 'em."
"Already," Rachel exclaimed, incredulous.
"Let me get a few shots," Anton shouted out, as Hollis started up one of the ATV's, focusing on the gun mount on the front of the all terrain vehicle, where a rifle was attached.
"I got to write this down," he told Hollis, pulling out a small notebook and scribbling furiously in it for a moment.
"What you got there?
A  Remington 750.
Got it."
"You ready?"
Hollis wanted to know, looking in the distance, scanning the steep slopes all around them.
"Let's get movin'."
Rachel waited for Anton to put his camera away then put on the helmet Hollis had issued them.
She reluctantly placed her helmet on and tried not to laugh.
"What's that thing?"
she asked, pointing at his helmet.
"This?  a helmet cam," he replied, grinning.
"I'm prepared.
I will be filming everything, in HD," he explained.
"We're making a movie--didn't they tell you?"
he joked.
"Right," she said, shaking her head.
"This might be the dumbest thing I've ever done."
"You're kidding.
Not even close," he sang out, climbing on the ATV.
"Come on, we are wasting the good light."
Up ahead, in a cloud of dust, they could see Hollis speeding along, going faster than they felt was safe.
Anton hadn't been on an ATV since High School when he would occasionally go on outings with friends to less frequented sites around Red Rock Country.
He was keeping a close eye on the road conditions, not wanting to spin out or turn the vehicle over.
The old mining road had quickly turned into a long upward climb, with a precipitous drop off on both sides.
It was obvious the trail had been built when the miners were using mules for transportation since it was getting progressively narrower as they went along.
Up.
Higher.
He guessed the drop off to be over two hundred feet or more.
Although he wasn't particularly afraid of heights, he was still uncomfortable traveling over a disappearing tract with a crumbling surface.
Hollis stopped up ahead a hundred yards or so and was talking on his radio.
They soon caught up with him and Rachel released her grip around Anton's waist, embarrassed that she had resorted to holding on because she was frightened she would tumble off the back of the ATV.
Anton was concentrating so much on the route upwards that he hadn't even noticed her death grip.
"You two okay back there?"
Hollis called out, as they inched closer to where he had stopped.
