That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.

'' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Charlie sat up straighter and stared at him more intently now.
She was hoping that soon everything would make sense and she would see if things could yet be salvaged.
"I'm not actually a wizard," said Rowan.
"Wizards are human beings who develop magical abilities here on Earth."
"You say the word human like it's something different than you..."
said Charlie, curiously and a bit afraid.
"Yes, and that's because I'm not human.
Neither was I born on Earth.
I'm a faerie, Charlie."
"A...fairy?
You mean like the little people who fly around with butterfly wings?"
"Not exactly," said Rowan, laughing.
"The Fae is a realm that lies just beyond that of Earths, where people who are born of magic come into existence - like me.
We're Fae people, otherwise known as faeries.
That's why my life here has been so complicated.
It's not uncommon for faeries to visit this realm, that's the reason why humans invented folklore and stories about seeing our kind, but the King of the Fae forbids us permanent residency here.
He is a strict believer that the immortal races should not live among mortals.
He's the one who's sent Roxy after me.
Like him, most of the Fae beings are self-righteous and believe themselves greater than the younger races.
It's the reason why after centuries of living among such people that I ran away.
My hope was that I could pretend to live my life here as human.
But, as you may have figured out, it hasn't exactly been easy."
"I never would have guessed," said Charlie, completely astounded.
"But there's something I don't understand.
If your goal was to life a simple human life, then why tell people you're a wizard?
Wouldn't that just tip off those who are after you?"
"You got it," said Rowan, grinning.
"I've tried to go without using magic for a long time.
But a faerie without magic is like a dog without its bark.
It just doesn't feel right.
That's the one thing I haven't been able to rid myself of because I love magic.
So, when people find out about me, I pretend to be a wizard."
"I guess I understand.
I'm a gamer, and my parents' laptop sucks for gaming, and solitaire just isn't cutting it.
But why would you want to leave a realm of magic?
It sounds amazing!"
"I admit that I do love The Fae, regardless of its people.
It's a place unlike any you'll ever see.
Beauty never fades with time, tender moments seem to last forever, and the creatures are majestic and free.
But The Fae will never possess one thing, the one thing that I admire so much in humans, and that's the value of life."
"I feel kind of dumb," said Charlie, "but I don't understand.
Wouldn't it be great to never die?"
"That's the question that took me centuries of living among you to find an answer to.
Faeries cannot grasp the concept of death since we can never die.
But to mortals, it's an ever-present fear and reality that one day they will perish and fade away...
It's what makes you unique.
It fills you with the desire of making every day of your existence one that will matter.
Life is precious to you, and so your passions have that much more meaning."
Charlie stared into Rowan's eyes as the significance of his words tore deep into her heart.
Here sat a magical, immortal person who admired humans for their value of life and the intensity of their passions.
And in truth, the more she listened to him, the more it saddened her.
Rowan loved people for those very reasons, but she couldn't take credit for any of it.
She had never lived an exciting, passionate life.
She felt that everything Rowan described was everything she was not.
When she woke up in the morning, it wasn't thrill seeking or different ways of how to make her day count that she first thought of.
Instead, she thought of how much she hated her job, how to avoid as much social interaction as possible, and how much time she'd be able to sit in front of her computer and hack away at pixelated monsters.
All the while Rowan explained these things, Charlie thought of Mr. Morris' sandwich and of how she actually envied him.
"Is something wrong?"
asked Rowan, noticing the tears welling up in Charlie's eyes.
"No," said Charlie, turning her head away and wiping her eyes with her sleeve.
"It's nothing.
It's just been an overwhelming few days is all."
"I'm sorry if I've caused your life to becoming something you never wished it to be," said Rowan, with genuine sincerity.
"I never meant for you to get caught up in all of this.
I just hoped that I could have made things work this time.
But I'm learning that that may never happen."
He paused, and then slowly, he reached his hand to place it over Charlie's.
"I care about you, Charlie Cradle."
Charlie turned back to face him, wanting to tell him that no one had ever made her feel the way that he did now.
However, their special moment was suddenly interrupted by the sound of an approaching motorcycle.
The engine roared so loud that both of them were forced to tear their sights from each other and look toward the advancing rumble.
And then, as the woman wearing a black leather jacket parked her bike and raised her helmet's visor to look at them, Charlie's heart dropped in her chest.
Roxy grinned and waved them hello.
Chapter 16
"Hi, Charlie," said Roxy, waving and grinning mischievously from where she stood by her motorcycle.
"I'm so glad we were able to come an understanding.
Now come on quietly, Rowan, unless you want to get these poor people involved as well."
What is she doing here?!
Charlie's heart thrummed in her chest and her mind raced back to Roxy's card in her purse.
Since her mother had picked her up, she had totally forgotten about her number.
But she never called it either, so why was Roxy standing on the edge of her driveway now?
"What is she talking about, Charlie?"
asked Rowan, looking at her with concerned eyes.
Charlie stepped to the edge of the veranda.
"What are you doing here?
I never called you!"
"Oh?"
said Roxy, grinning.
"Then why is your parents' number showing up on my cell?"
Charlie didn't understand.
How was it possible that she had received a call from her parent's number if she had never even taken the card out of her purse?
Then, the answer suddenly hit her. Mom. Rowan continued to look at Charlie for answers, and through his expression she could see the thoughts of betrayal playing on his mind.
She felt sick to her stomach that he might think she set him up.
If only she had thrown out that card the moment she received it.
"I know this looks really bad," said Charlie, taking Rowan's hand in her own, "but you've got to believe me when I say I had nothing to do with this."
Rowan appeared to be considering whether to believe her or not, but then nodded and slightly tightened his grip on her hand in confirmation to his belief.
Charlie silently thanked her stars and then guided him into the house and away from Roxy.
"Oh come on, Charlie!"
said Roxy, calling out to them.
"You're so close to ending all of this.
Don't make it harder on yourself now."
Then, her irritation for that woman reaching its limit, Charlie built up her courage and did something she had wanted to do since that first day when Roxy barged into her apartment.
As she and Rowan reached the doorway, Charlie turned around and flipped Roxy the bird.
"Screw you!"
Roxy must have been sure Charlie was going to give up and comply, because the look on her face now spelled out surprise and offense.
It pleased Charlie to know she was able to out rightly piss her off, even if she knew she might regret it soon after.
As Charlie slammed shut the front door, her mother came out from the kitchen to investigate all the commotion, and looked out the window to see who was there.
"What's going on?"
she asked.
"Oh, Charlie, has your friend arrived already?
Wow, she's fast.
I only just called her five minutes ago."
"You what?!"
said Charlie, trying very hard not to scream at her mother.
"Mom, where did you get her number?"
"Well, don't be mad at me, because it was supposed to be a surprise.
But since Rowan showed up, I thought it would have been nice to have a get together with all your old friends and some of your new ones.
So I did some digging around in your purse to see if I could find some of your friends' phone numbers.
The only thing I could find was a white card with the name Roxy on it, and she seemed more than excited to come by."
"That woman is not my friend," said Charlie, so angry at her mother that she literally wished to strangle her.
"She's a bad person, Mom, and she's not here to sample your cheese and crackers."
While Charlie spoke, worry and concern had begun to build up within her mother's eyes.
She didn't do well under great amounts of stress, and the notion that Roxy was there to do them harm was starting to make her panic.
But then Rowan did something unexpected, and Charlie watched as he walked up to her mother and took her hands within his own.
A blue glow pulsed from his hands and just as she had witnessed before, he spoke an incomprehensible word and the effects of a spell had begun to take place.
Charlie's mother's eyes closed and she collapsed to the floor.
"What did you do to her?"
asked Charlie, worried that Rowan just killed her mother.
"Don't worry," said Rowan, picking her up in his arms and carrying her to the living room couch.
"I just placed her under a sleep enchantment.
She'll sleep through the night without any memory of what happened."
"Thank God.
If she knew about wizards - I mean faeries - and magic, I think she might actually need to be admitted into a psych ward.
It's a good thing Dad's at work too.
So now that that's taken care of, what should we do about Roxy?"
"That's the million dollar question, isn't it?"
said Rowan.
"I hate to say it, but there's much else that we can do but run."
"Can't we fight her or something?
What if you use your magic like last time but stronger?"
"Unfortunately, even that's only a temporary solution.
I couldn't kill Roxy even if I wanted to because Fae people can't be killed.
To you, it would look like death, but she'd be reborn the next day and would keep coming after me.
The best we can do is slow her down and wait until she finds us again."
Charlie could tell that Rowan was becoming weary of this never ending game of hide-and-seek.
She wondered just how long he had been running from her.
Twenty years?
A hundred years?
Five hundred years?
She knew that if she were in his shoes, she probably would have given up a long time ago.
