With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being.

For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense.

It is not my role to change their path; only they have the ability to do that.
But what I do know is that when people start to forgive, there is more softness in them, more ability for them to open themselves up to needing less control in their life; leading to the   building of closer relationships which allows them to change their tapestry of life and to thread with brighter colours, with brighter days ahead.
It is amazing and a sight to behold when someone is released from anger.
The ability to talk for the first time with clarity about that which caused them pain and who caused the pain provides the beginning of a way forward to understanding yourself more.
If we can begin to understand who we are, then we can begin to walk towards who we were meant to be.
It is a journey within our journey, one of discovery and forgiveness for us, one that brings light into our lives, which will touch all those around us.
A world where souls can grow and open their inner eyes could enable all to behold the beauty of our planet and it will be another step towards the collective consciousness working together to support the Earth to weave its tapestry too.
By not forgetting, we learn to respect ourselves.
It is not right that other humans are able to inflict devastation and pain in our lives; we need to build self-respect.
By remembering in a calm way, we give ourselves an insight into how we should not act and how we do not want to be treated again.
From reflection, we can hold within us knowledge about the signs we need to recognise to protect ourselves in the future.
This can make us gain insight and build on our intuition.
So, overall, not forgetting is a positive experience, a positive thread in our tapestry against the negative experience of not forgiving.
Our tapestry of life does not only get woven through our struggles and sorrows, its threads come also from our happiness and joyfulness.
These threads are the colours of the rainbow that intricately get woven with love and tenderness.
The joys of the world are many; we can choose to walk the paths that will enhance who we are and support us to become who we are meant to be.
A child being born, the sun in the sky, the smile on a face, laughter in the air and the blue sea at the shore are joyous things, along with so many more.
You will have your own things in your life that will make you happy; as you experience them and think of them, imagine that your tapestry is growing brightly in your life.
Visualisation is a good technique.
I have adopted it many times since I started to understand and embrace the concept of the tapestry of life.
I really don't know what it looks like, if it is supposed to resemble anything particular, so I hold in my mind a storybook with pages filled of my life.
As we all have free choice, the vision of your tapestry can be anything that you want it to be.
My tapestry pages are based on years: each page represents a year and I look back and think about what colours would have been woven when.
Were they bright, and if so why?
Were they dark, and if so why?
What length of thread was used and when did it change in thickness and colour?
By reflecting on my experiences visually, both good and bad, I can begin to build a picture of my life and see what impact there was on me, as well as my impact on others.
My tapestry is now much more colourful, the thread I weave is like silk, whereas it has been like twisted rope before; well, that is how I have visualised it.
Once again it has taken me years to be able to think and act as I now do, with many good choices in my life path leading me to meet the individuals that I am meant to meet to ensure that I move towards who I am truly meant to be.
I am not perfect, and I do not have all the answers, and nor would I presume that I do, but I have developed certain ways and understandings that have helped me look within myself.
This has been life changing for me and I hope that, by sharing my thoughts and the understanding I have developed, you may be able to take some of these and adapt them to your life; and open up your own wisdom that fits your own life, which you can then share with others, so they may be able to look within and change their tapestry of life.
There is so much potential in each and every one of us at all different levels of life.
Everybody's tapestry will be different: some will never leave the dark thread, some will move in and out a complex pathway of all colours, dark and light, and some will weave in gold and silk all their lives.
None of us are meant to have the same tapestry, all of us are unique and equality will never be on this Earth.
The human species would not survive if we all had the same.
But what I do believe is that we should all have equality of choices, which are relative to where we are born on this planet.
We need to grow our intuition, our ability to recognise signs, which lead us to the right choices, and I believe that the 'tapestry of life' can begin to assist us with this.
For nothing is more powerful than seeing where you have come from and understanding how you have got where you are.
It may be that we really don't like what we find, but if we don't look, then how can we see where we need to go?
I look back on stages of my life and some I am ashamed of, some I am sad about and some I am happy about.
I can see how my actions changed my tapestry and also how others have woven the colours for me by their actions.
There are times when the actions from me on others have caused my tapestry to blacken, but with the knowledge and insight I have developed, I am able to forgive myself, which is one of the most freeing experiences I have ever felt.
Nobody ever gets everything right.
We all do things, which we wish we had not, but as long as we can begin to understand and look to find reasons why and learn from our actions to become a better person, then we will learn to forgive, not only ourselves but others too.
Our tapestry of life will become intricate and colourful and we will be able to experience life more fully, more gently and contribute positively to the growth of the collective consciousness that walks this earth.
By this time snow had begun to lightly fall: I wrapped my blanket tightly round me and walked silently with Miriam towards the shack just ahead on the mountain path.
Miriam's blanket glowed and made you feel warm just by looking at it: it was if she had a bubble of protection against the elements placed around her.
Strangely, there were parts of my blanket that were comfortable to be against more than others; more warmth radiated in certain areas, which I tried to stay within.
I struggled to maintain full body warmth and longed to be in the shelter of the shack's four walls, for I had faith that in there I would be given what I needed.
The shack was basic, unlike where we had been before, but it was out of the wind and I was grateful for that.
There was a small stove, which we lit with the wood that lay beside it.
The only real light was Miriam's blanket.
Food was what we had carried in our backpacks.
Miriam opened her blanket out and its radiance filled the shack and the warmth from it kept us warm until the fire could take over.
Our comfortable silence was short this time; Miriam broke it by explaining that she had listened to me and my explanations of the tapestry of life and she would like to add to this from her own experience.
This was exciting for me for this was the first time she had really given me insight from her, rather than just listening to me.
I sat, in anticipation.
"Your knowledge is far above what we had expected and for that we are truly grateful.
You have learned well and we gain strength in knowing that the choice we made many moons ago was the right one.
But yours is a lifetime journey and I am here to help you with this stage of growth and for that I will show you the tapestry of my life".
With this she spread her blanket on the floor before me: no longer was it a blanket but an intricate woven tapestry, full to the brim of colours that danced and played with each other, a symphony of life before me.
"Like yours" Miriam said "it was not always bright and warm.
It took hard work and courage to learn to love myself and make choices in my life that supported my soul's development.
The relationship you are building with yourself is leading you to where you are meant to go: the one you are building with me is so that you know you are on the right path".
With that, a tear dropped from her eye and she gestured for me to look at my blanket.
As I turned, there were more areas that were light and colourful than there had been when I left to walk the mountain, Miriam picked it up and wrapped it round me: it was warmer than before.
I slept well that night and woke refreshed.
Miriam made tea and beckoned me to the window; the sun was shining, the sky azure blue and ahead the mountaintop where we would end this part of our journey shone in the morning sun.
Miriam turned and smiled and said "Tell me about your understandings of relationships, Angela".
With this her hand reached into her velvet pouch and the golden dust was thrown on the floor before me and as it settled the verse read,
Within there lie unopened doors A whole new you to be explored Bring forth yourself both bold and true And build a relationship with you.
The golden dust lifted from the floor and returned to its velvet pouch, we shut the door, headed towards the summit and I began to talk about relationships.
CHAPTER FIVE Relationships exist between humans and nature; they are complex and can change the course of your life.
They can influence, they can harm, they can subdue, and they can bring joy and love.
There are so many elements to them, it is easy to think that they just happen; that there is no plan, you just meet the people you meet, you are in the places you are just because you are, and you have what you have in your life, just because you do.
I believe that we go where we are meant to go and meet whom we need to meet.
Sometimes people stay in our lives for a long time, others just come and go.
There has been much written on synchronicity, serendipity and coincidences: you can read the texts that are available on these subjects, as I have done; I have linked some of what I read to my life, which led me to have more insight and understanding about my life so far and how it may have been influenced by such circumstances.
Sometimes, though, you may have to go back a long way before you understand why a certain person entered your life, why a particular relationship formed and how that supported you in getting where you are today.
Reflections on past relationships, people you have met and places you have been enable you to look at the outcomes of these and what influence they may or may not have had on what you do, where you are now and who you are.
There is a power to relationships, which we don't often acknowledge; we just accept them as part of our everyday existence.
Our relationship with nature is vital to ensure that our planet can continue to support us and we in turn can support our Earth; and the relationship you can build with yourself, your inner life, and your soul is just as vital.
If you knew yourself more and had more understanding and clarity about who you are and what you want and where you want to be, it could enable you to make more informed choices.
But to build a relationship with 'you' can feel quite strange, and when I decided to build a relationship with myself, I found it quite difficult.
I started by putting some time aside on a regular basis, as I needed to learn how to listen to my inner self in a way that was respectful and not dismissive.
I needed to tune into my thoughts and begin a conversation with myself.
I suppose it is a bit like meditating but instead of clearing your mind, you invite thought in.
What I have found over a period of time is that I have become much more aware of my surroundings, my life, the way I am being, my reactions and my achievements.
Whilst practising this, a change took place within me, leading me to having more control over who I am, what I would like to achieve in my life and what I would need to do to achieve my hopes and aspirations.
This all came about because I began to understand myself, to see how my actions could either help me achieve my goals or not.
I started to gain control over me: rather than just reacting to everything around me, I became more responsive.
This has changed me.
It has made me more reflective and accepting of where I am because I feel I can move myself forward now, if I work with the support of my inner self.
Of course, I do not and cannot stand alone but I am able to make informed choices because I listen to my inner self.
I wanted more control in how I came across to others; I wanted to feel calm in myself, and to feel at peace when interacting with others.
I have found that by connecting to my inner self it has helped me to be where I am today.
It doesn't mean that you lose your spirit or your enthusiasm; it just gives you the ability to put your ideas and thoughts across in a more measured and assured way.
It is not easy learning to listen to yourself: having conversations with yourself through your thoughts is a life long experience.
We are not here to be fully-grown within a specific period of time.
We need to learn that life is a continuous path and that we are always growing.
How much we feed this growth depends how much we become our true self.
Conversations with me are guided by my faith.
The understandings I gain and the answers I get provide me with direction and encouragement to become who I am meant to be.
If you don't hold faith, that's ok too; I don't care where you think the words, thoughts, feelings or signs come from, just as long as you listen when they come.
Everyone has the ability to have a relationship with his or her inner self; in fact, it is necessary for the future of our planet.
If we can all begin to awaken our consciousness, it will guide us towards being more fulfilled, and we will develop a greater understanding of life and obtain the ability to embrace more fully the wonders of the world.
We can and will build a collective consciousness, which will only be fully achieved by the development of the human soul in each and every one of us; a relationship with yourself forms the building blocks for your soul to grow.
If we can begin to feel more at one with ourselves, then we may see more, feel more awake and fully embrace all that life has to offer us.
I do not advocate that we become an individualistic world but in order to come together we first have to know ourselves as individuals before we can begin to link positively as a collective.
This is enormous and will probably not happen in my lifetime but it has begun and needs to continue.
So, take time, listen to your thoughts and see what they say and where they take you, start a relationship with yourself and see where it leads; you may just get a great surprise.
This can start with one human being, just one individual and then another and then another, until there are more human beings with relationships with themselves than there ever have been before, leading to a level of true knowing that can be used and joined together as a collective consciousness to support our relationship with the Earth.
By developing a relationship with yourself, it does not mean or imply that you stand-alone or do not need others; it actually means that you will develop an awareness as to who you are and this will enable you to meet others who are necessary for your future development.
They will support you towards your destiny, as you will support others who you will meet.
To know yourself is to release your true potential, which will guide you along your life path and build your tapestry of life.
We live in a world ravaged by war, hunger, natural disasters and inequality of power.
This will not disappear overnight but there must be a conscious move forward by the human race to re-look, re-evaluate and re-educate the powers of the world, the few who believe they can answer for the many.
If we don't begin to see how interrelated all things on this planet are, we will continue on the road to destruction.
Everyone and everything can link to all things; nothing can stand in isolation, for it will not survive.
The Earth also makes choices; it is a living entity.
Its choices come from our actions, it reacts to us as a species and therefore we must change and show the Earth a new way forward.
The world we live in is fast, furious and sometimes it can turn on us through the power of nature.
The planet does have a way of placing us back in situations where it hopes we will begin to re-think our strategies.
It wants us to re-think our relationship with it.
Some do: there are movements that see what is needed but the shift needs to come from more people.
We need to ask ourselves what do we want, where do we see our children in the future, what do we want for them and what do we want for ourselves?
The human race was not born bad, there is goodness in our souls and most people want a safe planet, with opportunities and peace in the future but to achieve this you need to ask yourself what you can do to make a difference?
You will answer yourself but will you truly hear the answer?
It is my belief that we must all develop our ability to listen.
We have to want to truly know; if we do, then the answer will be given to us and, if you feel like I did when I truly heard, then you could begin the journey towards freedom and control towards your destiny.
Your one voice will touch others and the collective spirit will begin to be re-charged.
You will begin to make a difference, not only to the future of the world, but also to you.
For you will begin to experience life as it was meant, one of compassion, enlightenment and peace.
I know this sounds idealistic, but it doesn't mean that I don't believe that this can be achieved.
What I do question is; does the human race want to achieve it?
Relationships in this world come in many forms.
When we are empty inside, angry and sad, we can develop unhealthy relationships where violence, substance misuse, obsessiveness and hatefulness can grow.
We look to belong in places where there is anger, sadness and sorrow: these relationships hold souls in a place where they can't function and exist.
For these inner lives to shine through again takes courage to be able to confront and look inwards, rather than outwards for a solution.
I have experienced such times and have been to places I should not have gone and understand the courage that is needed to start such journeys.
I believe that help is all around and listening to your inner self can lead you to those that can show you the path to reach a different place than where you are now, if that is what you want.
Everyone has choices, some more than others; we can only make a difference in others' lives; for we can't change them.
It takes them to change, as it is their path, not ours to walk.
Developing a sense of self through building a relationship with yourself enables you to accept yourself for who you are and it can help you find your reason for being.
For me, the ultimate reason for being here is not complicated but simply to know love, to know happiness and to know life.
Building that relationship with yourself, looking inward and listening to what you hear from within can be quite amazing.
Our relationship with the earth needs to change, we need to understand it more, respect it more and learn to use its resources more effectively.
If we continue to need technological advancements, faster cars, bigger houses, higher paid jobs etc., then our planet will continue to fail; this is not radical science, this is just fact.
You can only get so many apples from an apple tree in its lifetime before it will stop producing, if it is not fed, watered and cared for appropriately.
It will not be easy to give up on our lifestyles or our wants or our needs, because this is our culture, a culture where the need for more, for the newest as well as the need to have it now, is paramount.
