Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

You believed in me then..."
"It was easy."
"You were the only one..."
"Their loss..."
"Well...
I never forgot... when things would be bad...
Your faith in me kept me going."
"Wow, Peg...
I never knew..."
"And...
I believe in you now..."
He pulled her close.
Their lips met with an ever increasing heat.
It grew from a sweet smolder in a roaring volcano.
He moved his mouth to run them down the side of her neck.
She called his name and pulled his mouth back to hers.
Their tongues tickled each other and danced a wild tango in and out of each other's mouths.
He broke free from her kiss and dropped his mouth to her breast.
Her back arched as he licked and then drew the hardening stub of flesh into his hungry mouth.
"Oh, my God...
Oh, Freddy..."
He smiled as he moved farther down.
His mouth followed the trails blazed by his hands.
The silk turned to fire.
The fire turned to thunder.
The thunder roared in both of their ears until years of sadness was burned from them both.
They slept the sleep of new lovers.
Only the warmth of a well banked fire remained as they lay exhausted under the stars.
The moon paid them no attention as it passed across the midnight sky taking its silver light.
It set beyond the bobbing ship unnoticed by the sleeping lovers.
They awoke once more before the sunrise.
This love was slow and gentle.
This meal of love was savored.
They knew when they slept that, this time, they had loved each other well.
They had spent the coins of love, spending them in shared passion in the darkness.
The last thing they both thought before they slept was that they were each happier than they had been in years.
Chapter 31; Sunday
In the gray light of pre-dawn, they woke in each other's arms.
After laying there enjoying the gentle rocking of the boat, Peg noticed something that made her very glad.
She pulled Fred close, "Is your friend back?"
"Yes..."
"Shame to waste it..."
So, they didn't.
When they had recovered their breath, she padded around the bed into the water closet.
After she was done, she looked out the tiny porthole.
She shrieked and ran back and jumped under the covers, "Holy crap!"
"What?"
"We're surrounded by senior citizens...
Heathen ones...
Don't they know it's Sunday!
They should be in church..."
"They worship at Our Lady of the Blue Shy..."
Fred laughed.
She had drawn the covers up over her head.
"Not funny..."
Fred went into the head to do his business.
He pulled on his cargo shorts.
Barefoot and shirtless, he went up the gangway.
He looked back at her looking like a small child with only her wild, blond hair and giant blue eyes outside of the covers, "You just let me handle this, Little Woman..."
"Oh, you!"
She threw an empty pop can.
It bounced off the door as he shut it behind himself.
He laughed all the way to the steering bridge.
He started the boat, got himself a soda while he was letting it warm up.
After a while, he guided the square vessel through the pack of fishing boat s that packed the little cove.
Once they were outside the cove and around a bend, he said, "You can come out now, Princess...
The mobs of your admirers have been left far behind in our wake."
He directed the boat out into deep water to avoid any other fishermen.
She came out dressed and looking around.
It crossed his mind to ask her what was underneath the dress, but, he thought that if he asked her, then, she might show him.
Then, they would definetly be late for church.
Instead he leaned down as she kissed him.
"Mmmmm..."
she said as she leaned her head on his shoulder.
He held her hand and the comfort that streamed between them was both a surprise to and healing for them both.
They stood like that as he brought the boat softly against the dock.
Peg jumped off and tied the back end as he went through the shutdown procedures.
Together, they tied the front and kissed again.
They went inside and took quick showers.
They dressed casually and headed for Teeny's.
Peg called ahead and ordered omelets and pancakes.
It was already on the table when they arrived.
Peg called, Hey, Papa..."
He waved to them through the kitchen window as Big Teeny brought two steaming mugs of coffee.
"Delilah okay?"
"That brand new grandbaby of mine be giving her the morning pukes...
She's layin' down out back..."
"Your magic juju tea didn't work, huh?"
"Oh, I made that whole magic juju story up for Miss Jeannie...
It's really just a powder of ground sasparilly root...
Sasparilly's good for settlin' the tummy on some people...
Believing is healing...
Now, that's from my granny!"
She walked away laughing a deep rumbling laugh.
"And the Jamaican juju thing?"
"More meddlin'...
My Jamaican granny been dead a long time...
Papa showed our Sheriff a good back rub for his wife... makes him feel not so helpless...
Gives him somethin' ta do..."
Fred laughed, "Whatever works, Mama..."
"This morning, I gave Little Teeny some boiled peppermint leaves and chinese black tea with dry toast...
It settled her to sleep...
It's been slow out here this morning, so, me and Papa, we got dis...
We'll try that sasparilly after her nap.
Fred called Greg, "All quiet?"
"Well...
Jeremy failed to do his duty again."
"Didn't hang himself, huh?"
"Nope... coward..."
"See ya in church?"
"Back row..."
"Roger that."
They headed for Eddyville.
In the gathering, Peg got busy showing off the ring to every female above the age of ten .
Fred shook hands with everyone as they congratulated him.
As the music started inside the chapel, people filed in and took their places.
Fred sat by Greg and Peg sat by Fred.
She leaned across him to show Jeannie her ring.
Greg looked down at it as her hand was mooned over by his wife.
"It's all downhill from here, Sergeant."
Fred laughed, "Roger that, boss...
I see how horrible things are for you...
Just couldn't let you go through it alone..."
They laughed and shook hands warmly.
"Roll call at 7..."
"Roger that!
Jimmy will be back, so, I'll catch Peg up..."
"Nah... bring him...
I been missing that munchkin..."
As they were leaving church, there was an equally long gauntlet of women and girls to show the ring to.
It seemed to take forever to make their way out of the old church.
The older women knew Gramma Eudora well.
Before she had passed, she had been one of the great ladies of the Mission's Guild.
Finally making her escape, Peg whispered to Fred, "Big City, I declare that I have never been so relaxed for Sunday service..."
"Go straight to hell...
Do not collect 200 bucks..."
"Oh, Freddy...
You are worth waaaay more than 200 bucks..."
he kissed her as he helped her into her side of the car.
The whole crowd outside of the church watched them kiss and broke into spontaneous applause.
Fred and Peg waved and drove out as quickly as they dared.
Chapter 32; Sunday PM; The Prodigal Baby Returns
When they pulled up to Peg's, there was a shiny pickup in the drive.
"He's home!"
Peg called as she ran into her house.
Fred hurried after her.
In the living room was a tall, dark man quickly going to fat around his middle.
He was reading Peg's paper and drinking a beer.
Peg was standing by the door looking stiff.
Fred couldn't tell if she was feeling angry or just uncomfortable.
