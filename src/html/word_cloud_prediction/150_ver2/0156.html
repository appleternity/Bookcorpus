This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.

'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !'

Mike was reminded of just how much care his hometown took in preserving nature amid the high pace of urban life and burgeoning state university.
I nearly forgot how beautiful this town is.
Why was it that I left here for Washington so many years ago?
Hmm...
Mike thought as an alarm began beeping on his vehicle's navigation system.
They were nearly there.
"IT'S NOT MUCH, but it's a home away from home, I suppose," Mike said with a shrug, as if he needed to explain to the two visitors something about his Gainesville condo.
Of course, given the Spartan use of the place, perhaps the concern was warranted, if just a bit self-conscious.
There were few furnishings, almost no personal effects or pictures on the wall.
The condo nearly had the look of an expensive but impersonal hotel suite.
Detective Marx and Adam hung back in the foyer area between the living room and the bedroom while Mike went off to grab the letter.
"Come on, guys, make yourself at home," he said as he picked up the letter.
"You know, what's so strange about this letter is that I was given a digital message asking me to open it after I got home," Mike said.
"Do you have any idea who could have sent either message, Mike?"
"No.
I just know the guy knew about the hazelnut incident, which had not yet been reported to the press," Mike said after handing the letter to the detective.
All three of them settled onto the sofa and chairs in the living room.
"Hmm..."
Three low sounds - blurp, blurp, blurp - broke everyone's concentration.
The detective stood as he pulled out his beeper.
"The forensic people have the results for y'all.
Excuse me while I step outside," Marx said.
Finally, someone can give us a better idea of who might have set up that accident.
Mike thought as he followed the detective's movement.
Mike's gaze fell to see Adam's ghost-white face.
"What's wrong, Adam?
Are you okay?"
"It's just the thought of it all.
Hopefully this will all be resolved soon and we can get back to filming after we arrest the guy who has been doing all of this."
"You know, it might just be a series of innocent pranks gone bad."
"Maybe."
"Forensic science is pretty damn impressive," Mike added.
"Who do you think could have done it?
How about the janitor who asked us about the clean up?"
"Nah, he's just a janitor.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?"
"Why not the guy who plays Matt Nadler?"
"Nah, too predictable as a bad guy."
"I got it!
Professor Clue is the murderer, in the kitchen with a butter knife!"
The two of them laughed heartily until they heard the outside door shut, and found that the detective was back from his brief conversation with the forensic team.
"What's the verdict?"
Mike asked, only half interested in knowing the final truth, and the other half fearing it.
"Yall won't like to hear it."
THE DETECTIVE WAS right.
Thankfully, he left them shortly after delivering the news, allowing them some time to think over the implications and debate with each other about what to do next.
"I just can't believe it, Mike!"
"Neither can I.
First, hazelnut coffee triggers an allergic reaction.
Then I receive a threatening letter at my home.
Finally, one of our main actors trips down the stairs."
"The only real question I have, Mike, is..."
"Right.
Whether to suspend filming."
IF THE DETECTIVE was tall and fat, his assistant was short and scrawny.
James Madison Rover didn't like his job as the assistant to the detective, but did thoroughly enjoy the investigative work.
As a little boy, he loved solving riddles, and playing with the Clue board game.
Today's mystery was definitely going to be hard to solve.
Who would want to hurt these people or would have the opportunity to do so?
Was their goal to stop the filming?
Jimmy looked over his boss's shoulder as the two of them scanned through the film's cast and crew.
The list was quite long even after ruling out the two victims.
"Ahh...
I know watcha thinkin', Jimmy."
"You do, sir?"
"I know ya strategy."
"What's that?"
"This being a crime, we need to treat it as such.
As in, the suspects aren't likely to be the janitors - too predictable."
"And...?"
"The victims couldn't have done it to themselves, nor could anyone that wasn't here on location."
"But sir..."
"What?"
"That doesn't eliminate anyone."
"That's right, Jimmy," as the detective rolled around, ignoring the scrolling images that were now behind him.
"To solve this crime, we've got to do the unimaginable."
"What's that?"
"Consider everyone a suspect, yet no one is safe."
Chapter Eight
TIMING IS KEY in life, but it could be downright deadly in politics.
That is why the politicians-in-training could often be found in high-speed chases rivaling the Indianapolis 500.
Candidates race to file; party leaders rush to get petitions signed and approved; activists grab the last few voters on Election Day.
Ben Burns and the gang found out that speed, not accuracy, was often the Holy Grail of their political lives.
Shortly after their failed filibuster, Ben and the gang scrambled to get an initiative on the ballot that would restore funding and autonomy to the academic groups that lost it.
The sun was literally setting on the last day to file their petitions.
Ben was watching from the group's meeting room over the Colonnade as several of his friends and colleagues ran in with their petitions.
"Is that all of them?"
Ben asked as he organized the piles of paper and looked at the dry erase board behind him.
"Nah, Wayne is coming back from University Avenue with the rest," someone said.
The small cadre, including Eric Keppler and Kendra Jacobson, sat down and dropped their placards and backpacks on the ground, next to a pile of campaign items.
Ben offered them drinks, and announced, "It looks like we need Wayne's petitions to get us there."
"We have less than ten minutes left!"
Kendra exclaimed.
Ben walked over to the window to try and get a first glimpse of Wayne as he made his way down the expansive urban meadow called the North Lawn, which was laid out in front of the Colonnade.
Eric chimed in, "Make that seven minutes."
All they could do was to wait.
"Did Ian lend his motorbike?"
"Yes, yes, calm down, Ben.
I have faith in Wayne.
You should, too."
The next six minutes were the most painful to sit through.
Everyone could hear and see Wayne make his entrance - up the Colonnade in a mad dash to the Student Government office complex on the third floor.
With a deep breath of relief, Ben said, "You cut it sorta close didn't, you?"
"That's what I live for," Wayne said, panting in between syllables.
He walked in with the supervisor of elections in tow.
She began counting off the signatures and made a gesture to collect the rest.
"Not a moment too soon," she said with a wry grin and spun off back to her office upstairs.
"It's days like these that I question why I do this as a hobby," Ben said.
"Ah, Ben, you love it!"
Eric said with a laugh that soon became contagious among the exhausted campaigners...
ROGER DAVIS WAS used to fame.
It took some convincing to get him to play the lead role in "A True Gator Party."
He never cared for film adaptations of books, and felt his notoriety gave him the opportunity to turn down any role he didn't like, even starring ones.
But after accepting the job and taking a tour of Gainesville with Michael and Adam, he became intrigued.
Perhaps it was the many residents who viewed Michael as their only celebrity, which annoyed him.
Or perhaps it was that the people of this college town took no bullshit, did not buy into the slick Hollywood culture, and never let life go by too quickly or too slowly.
Roger didn't mind the lines of fans seeking his autograph, even if they preferred "Ben Burns" signatures over his own.
He especially did not mind it on this occasion, when the turmoil on the movie set had left him with little else to do.
He was polite and cordial to the last of the fans and well-wishers as he departed.
It was cooler than the typical Florida weather, but it was still quite warm and humid.
He passed the main part of campus on his way back to his hotel to refresh himself with a good night's sleep.
It was still up in the air whether Michael and Adam would restart filming the next day.
As he passed the university plaza, he chuckled at how it resembled a disaster area from yesterday's activities.
Vroom.
The roar of an engine.
He turned in the direction of the sound, seeing nothing out of the ordinary.
He shook his head and resumed his leisurely stroll.
AFTER FOLLOWING ADAM back to his hotel room for a short conversation and a drink, Mike returned to his apartment.
He immediately noticed that the mail had arrived, including a large envelope.
He let the mail sit in the foyer area as he entered his living room to turn on the stereo, selecting something with a Latin beat.
He poured himself a glass of coke and rum and stepped into the bathroom to get the sticky sweat of Florida heat off his skin.
The sound of the shower running competed with the soft Latin music and the tick-tock of antique analog clocks in the condo.
AS ROGER APPROACHED the press tents on the north side of campus, he heard engine noise again.
Again, he turned to try and locate where the engine noise was coming from, but failed to find anything out of place on the nearly deserted campus.
Just a few students were seen knocking around a ball.
He didn't see the car sitting in the shadows of one of the dorms.
MIKE DRIED HIMSELF off with a large towel and then wrapped it around his waist.
He walked through the living room and stepped back into the foyer area to grab the mail.
Returning to the living room, he examined an over-sized clasped envelope.
It had no return address or any other identifier.
Not another one!
Mike thought as he dropped the mail on the floor and collapsed into the nearest chair.
He sighed nervously, continuing to hold the latest envelope in his hands.
ROGER DEFINITELY HEARD the roar of the engine this time.
As he passed the main library, a gray Ford sports utility vehicle with blackened windows whizzed past him, missing him by inches.
What the hell?
THE LETTER WAS almost exactly like the first one.
It was short, to the point, and disturbing.
It read: "You can choke on nuts and live.
You can always break a fall.
