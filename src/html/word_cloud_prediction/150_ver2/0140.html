A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Compatibility', 'tfidf': 1.4860903024673462, 'lexical_unit': 'compatibility.n / incompatible.a / cohere.v', 'definition': "Item-1 and Item-2 are compatible with each other if they can exist or function together in some context without problems, conflict, or other undesirable situation.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

He was driving a gorgeous silver BMW.
He must be loaded.
I poked my head in the car window on the passenger side and it still had a new car smell to it.
"Let me run this beer up and throw it in the fridge and I'll be ready."
I ran up to my apartment and shoved the beer in the fridge, then dashed in my room to check my face, run a brush through my hair and spray on some perfume.
"Mmm, you smell good enough to eat," Ezra said, giving me a sly smile when I climbed in his car.
He put the car into reverse, and I put my seat belt on to hide my smile.
His words made my body tingle.
"That sounds like a line from a horror movie.
I think rule number one in the dating handbook states no murder on the first date," I joked He gave me a sexy wink.
Ezra drove like a bat out of hell.
I really didn't know if we would actually make it to the movies.
As we squeezed into the parking spot furthest away from the theater, I thought about kissing the ground and thanking God I was alive, but I figured that would be a little too theatrical for a first date.
Instead, I hopped out and headed to the ticket counter.
I started walking beside Ezra.
His hand brushed mine and made my heart skip a beat.
I felt like a little kid in middle school as we started walking hand in hand.
I couldn't help but notice the touch of his skin was still so cold.
I felt on top of the world, I got looks from every girl in the theater.
We got some popcorn and a Coke Icee and found our seats.
We engaged in some great conversation before the movie started and had great body language after it started.
Each time his arm would rub mine I almost lost it.
He made me understand what people meant by irresistible.
Halfway through the movie, at exactly the quietest scene, Ezra's phone started ringing.
It made us both jump.
On top of the evil looks we received, he was having a hard time getting it out of his slightly tight pants and he dropped it.
He scrambled under his seat, trying to silence it.
I was laughing hysterically.
After that, we got through the movie just fine.
As we all filed out of the theatre, I couldn't help but wonder if everyone stared because of the phone incident or because of my gorgeous date.
We started walking to the car, laughing the entire time.
It was really late, chilly and abnormally dark.
Ezra must have read my mind, because he put his arm around me to keep me warm.
His car was all alone in the back of the parking lot.
He pulled me in close when we got back to his, wrapping one arm around my waist and lifting my face to his.
As our lips connected, I literally felt fireworks.
My blood seemed to be working overtime, rushing wildly through my veins.
I was worried he would hear my heart beating out of my chest.
A loud click came from behind me, and Ezra wrenched away, looking over my shoulder.
Stunned, I stumbled away, sudden chills rushing through my overheated body as I saw the two men coming at us, aiming a gun at my head.
Ezra had a look of pure hate on his face.
He moved so quickly I didn't realize he had shoved me, until I was on the ground.
I didn't feel anything, thanks to the adrenalin.
I scrambled to my knees as one of the muggers landed on the ground beside me, blood pouring out of his neck and head.
The other one was still wrapped in Ezra's arms.
To an onlooker it would seem like a tender moment, until Ezra snapped the mugger's neck.
It was either pass out or throw up, and since even in the middle of a bloodbath Ezra still looked sexy as ever, I chose fainting.
My body went limp.
Chapter Three
I awoke to find myself in my own bed.
The room was lit by a small lamp on my dresser.
It was still dark outside.
I didn't know how long I had been out for.
Ezra was sitting next to me.
I sat up quickly, surprised that for being almost robbed at gunpoint and thrown against a car, I felt pretty good.
"Ezra, you killed them."
I stated the obvious, feeling silly that I didn't have anything more intelligent to say.
"Sorry, I broke rule number one," he joked.
It took me a minute to catch on, but I wasn't in the laughing mood after what had happened.
I really didn't know what to think, I had never seen anyone die before.
I was probably still in shock.
"You didn't have to kill them.
What the hell were you thinking?
We need to call the cops," I yelled, reaching for my cell phone on the night stand table.
Ezra intercepted me and grabbed it first.
Great, I met a killer and dated him.
I had such bad luck.
"Ezra, give me my phone," I said through clenched teeth.
I was still scared and fear of him was finally kicking in.
My heart was racing.
"I'm not going to hurt you, Emily."
His expression was soft.
I really didn't know this guy all that well, and I'm not a very trusting person to begin with.
"I'm not going to wait to find out.
Now give me my damn phone."
I lunged for him, but he moved too quickly and I fell out of bed onto the floor.
Getting slammed into a car hadn't even hurt this bad.
I landed on my elbows and knees.
I rolled over and rubbed my knees, squeezing my eyes closed.
I've never understood why everyone closes their eyes when something hurts, maybe it's involuntary.
He pulled me up by my arm with his cold hands.
I jumped to my feet and took off running for the front door.
I felt him pass me as I sprinted to freedom.
He was already at the door before I even got out of the bedroom.
There was no way a human could run that fast.
I started backing up.
I just needed space between us.
Maybe it was my mother putting silly thoughts in my head that made me believe he wasn't normal, but I just had a bad feeling.
"What the hell are you?"
I asked him, scared to hear his answer.
He looked around the room, as if looking for an answer himself.
He shook his head and gave me a stare.
In a flash, he was standing a foot away.
I let out a scream and in a responsive reflex I punched him in the chest.
He caught me off guard, unaffected by my hit.
He stood like a statue.
I had to shake the pain from my fist.
It felt like I had punched a brick wall.
At this rate, he wouldn't have to kill me, I was going to end up killing myself.
"If I tell you, will you please promise to calm down?"
He sat on the bed, looking at his feet, as if he was embarrassed again.
Oh lord, please let him tell me he's a vampire.
I can't deal with another guy telling me that he's gay.
"Please don't be gay," I accidentally said out loud.
I clamped my hands to my mouth and sat down beside him.
Maybe it was the aftershock of everything that had happened, but I didn't have any fight left in me.
He had a slight smile on his face.
"No, you had it right the first time.
I'm not gay, and I am a vampire."
His smile disappeared.
I couldn't contain my laughter.
Now I knew I was still in shock.
This guy had killed two guys in front of me, moved abnormally fast and just told me he was a vampire.
One of us was going crazy.
"If you are a vampire, let me see your fangs."
My laughter stopped abruptly as his two canine teeth slowly grew.
The room started spinning as I passed out.
* * *
The sun was peeking through my windows when I opened my eyes.
Either everything that happened was a really bad dream or I was really going mad.
I was never so happy to see the sun before in my life.
Sun meant no vampire.
I gave an enormous sigh of relief as I rolled unto my back.
I got up and went to the bathroom.
I needed a long hot shower to clear my head.
The water felt amazing.
I noticed I had bruises on both knees so no dresses anytime soon.
Tears stung my eyes.
After everything that had happened, you wouldn't think two little bruises would make me cry, but they did.
Well, I really started crying because everything caught up to me.
I had met this perfect guy, and he just happened to be a psychotic killer who believed that he was a vampire.
I was thinking about everything we discussed as I dried off.
I went back to my room to get dressed and it took me a minute to notice Ezra was sitting on my bed.
I jumped so high I almost dropped my towel.
"What the hell are you doing?"
I yelled at him furiously.
He only had pants on, no shirt.
His bare chest distracted my train of thought.
Why did I care that this beautiful man was half naked in my bed?
Oh, that's right, because he believes he is a vampire and he killed some dudes.
I didn't understand why he was shirtless but I did appreciate the six pack abs.
"I was waiting for you to get out of the shower.
I thought I would give you some alone time," he said, matter of factly.
I gave him a stupid look.
"Well, glad to see you're not a vampire anymore.
At least we cleared up one of your outrageous convictions from last night."
I walked over to my dresser to find something to wear.
I guess I should've still been scared but I gave it up.
This guy wasn't going anywhere, and if he was going to hurt me he'd had plenty of chances to do it.
He just needed mental help.
