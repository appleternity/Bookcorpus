For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Similarity', 'tfidf': 1.7877645194492275, 'lexical_unit': 'similar.a / alike.a / resemble.v', 'definition': "Two or more distinct entities, which may be concrete or abstract objects or types, are characterized as being similar to each other.

'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.

To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}];

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar.

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

She then says, "Wow.
We see you have a very handsome fellow here with you Diane D.
Who is this handsome guy?"
The first black woman starts touching and rubbing on Jonathan's shoulder.
Jonathan smiles at the woman.
Diane D looks at the woman.
She then looks at Jonathan seeing him smiling at the woman.
She becomes annoyed and says to the woman, "Excuse me."
The woman stops as she and Jonathan turn and look at Diane D.  Diane D then says to the woman, "Don't you see him talking with me?"
Diane D holds her hand up to the woman and says, "Don't do that."
The young woman puzzled looks at Diane D.
She then says, "Oh I'm sorry Diane D, I didn't know he belonged to you.
Aren't you already married?"
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I am already married.
What's your point?"
"The point is, all I did was rub his shoulder."
"And I'm telling you not to rub his shoulder."
"Gosh Diane D?"
the second black woman says.
"Nobody can rub his shoulder?"
"No she can't rub his shoulder, she don't know him like that."
"But I didn't do anything wrong," the first black woman says.
"All I did was touch his shoulder, like this."
The woman rubs Jonathan's shoulder again.
Diane D becomes more annoyed and says, "Are you looking for a beat down Miss?
Get the hell off his shoulder!"
The woman quickly lets go of Jonathan's shoulder and strangely looks at Diane D as Diane D says to her, "Rub his shoulder one more time and there's going to be a problem."
"Calm down Diane D," Jonathan says.
The woman strangely looks at Diane D again and says, "Fine, I won't rub his shoulder anymore."
The woman and her friends puzzled look at Diane D.
They back away from Diane D and Jonathan as the woman says, "Sorry to bother you two."
"Yes we'll leave," the second black woman says.
"And we are going to leave right now," the white woman says.
"Please do," Diane D says as she angrily looks at the women.
The white woman grab all the other women as they all strangely look at Diane D.
They then turn and hurry away from Diane D as Diane D stares at them.
Jonathan looks at the women.
He then turns to Diane D and says, "Gosh Diane D, that was rude."
Diane D looks at Jonathan and says, "Correction, they were rude."
The young women quickly hurry to the other side of the lobby towards the elevator.
They stop and turn their heads around and look back towards Diane D.
They then turn to each other as the Hispanic woman says, "Man what is her problem?"
"I don't understand," the first black woman says.
"All I did was touch and rub the guy's shoulder and she had a fit."
"I know," says the second black woman.
"Who is she to tell somebody else to get off that guy's shoulder?
She doesn't own him."
"She sure doesn't.
Doesn't she already have a husband?"
"Yeah she sure does," the white woman says.
"But it's a good thing you did get your hand off that guy's shoulder Joyce because Diane D look like she was about to get out of control right there, the same way she got out of control when we all heard she attacked and beat up those security guards and those police officers."
"Would she have really gotten out of control if I didn't stop touching and rubbing that guy's shoulder?"
"You want to try challenging her to find out?
Try touching and rubbing that guy's shoulder again.
Believe me, Diane D wasn't playing when she said to you 'Rub his shoulder one more time and there's going to be a problem', she wasn't playing.
I saw it in her eyes."
"Yeah I saw it in her eyes too, that's why I quickly got off that guy's shoulder.
Isn't that the same guy everyone heard she disappeared with?"
"I'm not sure.
It sort of looks like him."
"I think it is him," the Hispanic woman says.
"That's probably why she was ready to get out of control again if you had touched that guy's shoulder again and we sure don't need that."
"I don't understand how Diane D was able to get out of control in the first place when she attacked and beat up those security guards and those police officers," the first black woman says.
"I don't understand how she was able to overpower them like that, she's only one woman."
"Diane D might be only one woman Joyce," the white woman says, "but whenever she gets angry and turns violent, she is known to have superhuman strength.
She is known to have the strength of ten men or have the strength of a wild animal or beast during her vicious assaults and vicious attacks.
Those security guards she attacked and those correction officers who tried to keep her in that jail cell labeled her the female version of The Incredible Hulk, in other words, she is known as The She-Hulk."
"The She-Hulk?"
"Yeah."
"Wow."
"Diane D has been in jail and in prison because of her vicious temper and her violent rages and she probably would go back to jail and prison for it again if she has to.
When it comes to situations like this, it's best to just walk away from it.
It's just not worth it."
"It sure isn't," the second black woman says.
"Especially over some guy."
"Yeah that's true.
Sometimes in life, men are just not worth fighting or challenging over."
"They sure aren't."
The women turn back around and take one last look across the lobby at Diane D.
They then see Diane D walking away as Jonathan walks behind her following her.
"Well there goes the She-Hulk walking away with her guy."
The women continue to stare at Diane D as Diane D continues to walk away with Jonathan then disappear around a corner.
"Wow," the second black woman says.
"It looks like the She-Hulk is disappearing with that same guy all over again."
"It sure looks that way."
The white woman turns to the other women and says, "Come on ladies let's get upstairs."
The other women turn back around.
They sadly walk away and head into the elevator.
Chapter 25
Mike And Mitch Get Dirty And Rude At Competition
A week later, thousands of people are on the stands at the Dirt Bike Competition shouting and cheering as big signs and banners read 'THE DIAZ-DAVIDSON ORGANIZATION PRESENTS THE DIAZ-DAVIDSON DIRT BIKE COMPETITION'.
Mike is wearing a short gray jacket, matching gray cap, gray jeans and black sneakers standing with his feet and legs spread apart, surrounded by around ten teen and pre-teen boys as four of them hold tightly on the dirt bike wheel as Mike tightens the screws on the motorized dirt bike wheel.
Mike finishes tightening the screws.
He throws the screw aside on the ground.
He then takes the dirt bike and gets on it.
He rides the dirt bike, speeding it as it roars down the dirt road.
The Diaz-Davidson Youth performers and athletes call out to Mike as he speeds the dirt bike into the distance.
Mike rides the dirt bike down the dirt path, speeding it as it roars down the dirt road.
The Diaz-Davidson Youth performers and athletes call out to Mike, "Hey Mike!
Yo Mike!"
Mike turns his head around towards the Youth Performers and athletes as he continues to speed his dirt-bike down the dirt road.
The Youth Performers and athletes continue to run towards him.
Mike approaches near Mitch, Barry, Tomas and around 20 white and Latino boys who are all on motorbikes.
The Youth Performers continue to run towards them.
Barry then asks, "Uh, where are you two's helmets?"
"We're gonna get them Mr. Barry," Mitch says, "right after this."
Mike and Mitch quickly start up their dirt bike engines and speed away to the start line as the other boys speed behind them.
Mike, Mitch and four other boys are at the start line.
They line their dirt-bikes alongside each other facing the same direction.
The rest of the boys start to line side by side and behind Mike and Mitch in 4 teams.
Mike is at the head of line 2 as Mitch is at the head of line 3.
The coach, a middle-aged white male, anxiously approaches Mike and Mitch.
He stands between them and shouts, "Where are your helmets?!"
"We don't know," Mike says.
"You can't ride in this race without any helmets!"
"Yes we can," Mitch says.
"Oh no you can't!"
"Yes we can," Mitch says as he turns his cap around.
"Our caps will be our helmets!"
"Your caps?!
I don't think so!
If you two ride without any helmets, your teams are gonna be disqualified!
Where's Mr. Barry?!"
"He went back to the stands!"
Mike says.
The gun sound pops!
Mike, Mitch and the other two boys at the head of their team gear up their engines.
The second gun sound goes off!
The coach grabs on both Mike's and Mitch's handle bars!
Mike and Mitch angrily shove the coach's hands off their handle bars then they and the other two boys race down the dirt way as their teams and people on the stands start to shout and cheer, "Go Mitch!
Go Mike!"
Several people in the stands are holding up large banners and signs high in the air reading 'GO MIKE AND MITCH!' while other people hold up signs reading 'THE DIAZ-DAVIDSON YOUTH DIRT-BIKE COMPETITION'.
Other people are holding up banners and signs reading 'THE DIAZ-DAVIDSON YOUTH ORGANIZATION'.
Mike, Mitch and the other two boys speed their dirt-bikes further down the dirt road!
Their dirt-bikes start to cause clouds of dirt around them.
The entire crowd and team continue to root for Mike, Mitch and the other two boys as they hold up the signs.
Mike, Mitch and the other two boys disappear into the dirt-cloud!
The coach turns around to the judges and shouts, "Mike and Mitch aren't wearing any protective jackets or any helmets!"
"We noticed!"
one of the judges shouts.
"They're gonna have to be disqualified for that!"
The coach and the judges look down the dirt road and watch the cloud of dirt that is still lingering on.
An hour later, Mary is in the stadium storage room.
She is pulling out some wash clothes and some hand towels.
Four of the salon women, Rosa, Gladys, Miriam and Bonnie come into the office.
They approach Mary as Rosa says,  "Hey Mary.
I heard you need us.
What happened?"
Mary turns to Rosa and says, "It's Mike and Mitch."
"Mike and Mitch?"
