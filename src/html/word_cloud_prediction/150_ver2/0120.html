That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

But he was using twenty-pound line that was tied to a sturdy stick that he firmly held in one hand, so unless the hook tore free at the fish end he for sure had lunch!
The pull was towards the water but then unexpectedly the pull came from above and then behind him.
Where the hell was the fish?
And the buzzing sound was louder than ever; where was the fly he was hearing?
It took a few more moments for it to register in Mark's confused mind that a giant fly and not a fish had taken his lure and was struggling to free itself twenty feet above his head!
"Kill it quickly and hide it or it will bring others!"
warned Ann from the tent opening where she watched.
Walking Stone shot off a fly wing with a well-placed ice projectile and Mark cut off the creature's head with his hatchet after it hit the ground.
After prying the fishing lure from its mouth he tossed all the oozing remains into a plastic garbage bag and climbed into the tent with it to hide it from detection by other hungry flies.
"I didn't realize that you were fly-fishing," Ann said.
"Congratulations."
"My fishing didn't go quite as planned," Mark noted, as Ann laughed.
"I have a sack of fly instead of a sack of fish."
"Well I got some great video out of it.
The look of shock and befuddlement on your face was priceless when you snagged that ugly thing!"
"You videoed me fishing?"
"Sure, I video record almost everything.
You never know when you'll capture something that you can use."
"I don't remember signing up to be in a news story," said Mark.
"You aren't in one yet; don't worry.
But would that really be a problem?
Most people like being in news stories."
"I don't know why," said Mark.
"Maybe they just want to be famous."
"Why would anyone want that?"
"So that they feel good about themselves.
So they feel that their life makes a difference."
"I don't see how that has anything to do with being famous."
Ann had to think about that for a minute before replying.
"Maybe for some people it does; I guess for you it doesn't.
I hope you weren't figuring on cleaning and cooking that thing here in my tent."
"The fly?
I hadn't figured what to do with it.
Maybe it would make good fish bait."
"No, you're going to eat it, right?"
asked Ann.
"I've heard of people eating them before.
Waste-not, want-not, as the saying goes."
"They also say you are what you eat, but you're right; I'll have to give it a try I suppose.
For the Tribe killing anything is serious and should have meaning."
"Cook it well done," advised Ann.
"Those things can carry very nasty pathogens.
I did a story on that once."
"Yes, I remember that story," said Mark.
"It was a nicely condensed version of a more detailed Scientific American article."
After an 'all clear' indication from Walking Stone Mark moved the fly out of the tent and butchered it.
He had butchered game animals before, but what fly parts were suitable as people food Mark could only guess at.
The dead fly stank and butchering it was a disgusting experience but he was very, very hungry.
He focused on the thorax: the middle section of the fly that contained leg and wing muscle.
The thicker leg sections also looked promising.
There was a tough outside carapace and hair to deal with, but that was no match for his hunting knife and hunger-driven determination.
He soon carved away two pounds of what vaguely looked like meat plus several leg sections.
The remaining fly parts he tossed into the stream, where he wasn't surprised to see trout eat them.
He was surprised to see that there were hundreds of trout, more than he had ever seen before.
What had drawn them?
"Well that figures," he muttered.
"Always happens once you've stopped fishing."
"That fly exhibited unusual behavior," noted Walking Stone.
"It dove straight towards you when it appeared, instead of buzzing around and cautiously spiraling towards the camp as if it saw or otherwise sensed something interesting.
There was little time for a warning."
"The lure must have really attracted it strongly," reasoned Mark.
He retrieved his pan from his backpack and fried a thick fillet of fly, along with some leg segments, with Walking Stone supplying the heat.
The Stone-Coat held the sizzling pan in one of his huge hands and stirred the sizzling fly pieces with a diamond claw of his other hand.
Ann moved to sit just outside the tent in order to better observe and record events.
"Perhaps," said Walking Stone.
"The issue requires further data for resolution."
"It smells pretty good," Mark noted.
"Maybe I won't starve after all."
"How is that pan being heated?"
Ann asked.
"By Stone-Coat.
A campfire would have been more readily detected by the flies," Mark noted.
"Electrical resistance is experienced in selected circuits of my hand," explained Walking Stone.
"It's actually a very simple phenomenon.
Mark prefers this to microwave cooking, though I could also provide that, and with greater speed and efficiency."
"You Stone-Coats are certainly amazing!"
Ann noted.
"Are you going to eat some of the fly also, Walking Stone?"
"I will consume what Mark leaves as waste but not segments that would provide food for him," replied the Stone-Coat.
"I will absorb waste to help avoid detection by other flies.
Currently I am not in need of any substances."
"I hadn't noticed you eat anything at all," Ann noted.
"That seems strange for such a big creature."
"I take on ice periodically; nothing else is needed," explained Walking Stone.
"Stone-Coats are mostly powered by nuclear decay, if that's what you wanted to know, though they also absorb solar energy," said Mark.
"They can and do consume almost anything to get the substances they need, especially trees for their carbon, but they don't really consume food for energy like we warm living things do.
They can actually go for millions of years without eating, as long as they have a trickle of electricity based on nuclear decay."
"That sounds handy," Ann muttered.
She was confused.
She had never heard of anything like this!
"The Prime Directive," Walking Stone reminded Mark.
Mark abruptly stopped explaining Stone-Coats to the outsider.
"This meat is very well cooked," he noted.
He speared a small bit of it on the tip of his knife and after blowing on it to cool it he bit into it.
"Oh wow!"
he muttered with his mouth full, "it's fantastic, once you get past the 'yuck' factor!"
"Let me try a bite!"
Ann requested.
"Why it tastes like chicken!"
she soon exclaimed.
"Like dark meat; and that's my favorite!
It's very good!
Please pass me a leg."
The rest of the fly meat was soon cooked and consumed by the hungry pair.
The armor-clad legs reminded Ann of snow crab legs, but the meat was more chicken-like in taste.
While Ann hobbled out of sight for another nature call and Mark cleaned cooking utensils in the stream Walking Stone startled Mark with a question.
"Are you going to soon mate with Ann?"
he asked point blank.
"What?
Of course not!
Why would you ask such a question?"
"You are adults of opposite sex and of suitable ages to reproduce," noted the Stone-Coat.
"I suppose that's true, but we've just met today and she's about twice my age."
"Is age parity a priority?"
"I don't know," Mark admitted.
"Your father is many years older than your mother."
"Why are we even talking about this?"
Mark asked.
"Human reproduction is a topic of our research," Walking Stone noted, "and it has also been noted in the Tribe caves that humans often engage in sex even when reproduction is not sought.
The entire sex issue appears to radically motivate and distort human behavior and culture."
"I guess, but I think we'll both get sex education this year in school," Mark noted.
"That should provide an optimal opportunity for your research on this topic.
I suggest that you save such questions until then."
He had never thought of it before, but when he eventually did have sex, did Walking Stone intend to observe?
No way!
"Affirmative," agreed Walking Stone, just as Ann lurched into view on her crutches and returned to hide in the tent.
"These wooden crutches that you guys made for me are perfect," she noted.
"Did you carve them with your hunting knife while I napped, Mark?"
"No, Walking Stone carved them using his teeth while he wallowed in snow.
He is very talented."
"I used designs obtained from the human internet," Walking Stone added.
"You have internet access?"
"Usually they do; they plug themselves right into it," said Mark.
"But not while on this quest," added Walking Stone.
"I am isolated from the other Stone-Coats and from their internet.
I downloaded several gigs of medical related information during the weeks prior to the quest in anticipation of their possible usefulness."
"You certainly know a lot about many human things, Walking Stone," Ann noted.
"Are you an adult Stone-Coat?
I've seen much bigger Stone-Coats than you."
"This entity is obviously a fully functioning autonomous unit," Walking Stone stated.
"The term 'adult' does not meaningfully apply to Stone-Coats."
"They don't have kids or adults or sex or mates like people do," Mark explained.
"Most of the Stone-Coats aren't even in the form of mobile units.
They only form mobile units when those are needed.
