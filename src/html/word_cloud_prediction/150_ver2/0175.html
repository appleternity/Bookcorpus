Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Maker, what the fuck was she thinking with him again?
Absence sure did help her to realize how much of a colossal ass he was.
Another scraping sound echoed from near the side of her wall and she placed her ear to it. Hm...
She knew that one pretty well and had a good guess what was up.
Sliding out of her bed, Myra reached for her clothing but shrugged it off.
The boots were useful though, her feet jamming quick into the too big things.
Without socks on they clomped back and forth leaving her tipsy but it was better than losing toes.
She did unearth her duvet off the bed and wrapped it around her shoulders like a great cloak.
Wearing just a long, ratty tunic and short pants she had to look mad while stomping outside in the middle of the night with snow sitting on the ground.
Good thing she was a mage.
Before the wind even had a chance to chill her bones, she raised up the warming spell she learned at college and sighed in contentment.
Her skin crackled like she was laying outside on a summer's day instead of huddled up against the burn of winter.
With one hand, Myra shifted the duvet tighter so it'd stay in place, and used the other to lift herself high into the air.
The climb was fast, and one she'd done thousands of times before.
Myra could probably climb to her roof in her sleep, every handhold etched into her heart, while she held her breath and listened.
Whatever'd been making those scrabbling sounds had stopped but probably because it got where it needed to be.
The rest of Denerim kept on slumbering; it was rare for a single girl scaling a wall to wake up anyone.
As she crested to the top of the roof, Myra let her head bob up a for a second to get a quick look-see.
Sure enough her assumptions were right.
Dropping the swift and silent act, Myra groaned a bit so as not to startle him.
She pulled herself up the last of the way, grabbed tighter to her blanket cloak, and plopped onto the roof.
"Are you some kind of Satinalia fairy?
One that loves hanging out on roofs in order to...stuff cheese into people's stockings?"
Gavin chuckled a moment as he pulled his knee tight to his chin.
He sat near the chimney's pipes, which had to give him a modicum of warmth, but the foolish boy didn't even bother to put a cloak on.
Dressed in the under tunic and breeches he stripped down to in order to sleep, his eyes swung over towards Myra.
The amber pinpricks were all she could see through the waning moonlight.
That wouldn't do.
Waving her fingers, she drew up a spark of veil fire right on top of the snow itself.
Gavin shifted a moment, as if afraid the fire might be real and he'd have to douse it, but as the blue light licked across him he calmed.
"Did I wake you?"
"No," Myra smiled as she stepped around the boy still sitting on the top of a roof in the midst of winter in his pajamas.
"It's perfectly normal to hear people trudging up here to squat in the snow."
Gavin snorted, but made no move to answer, those haunting eyes drifting around the tumbling blues of the snow.
With a sigh, Myra plopped down beside him and reached for his hand.
"Sweet Maker, you're freezing!"
she gasped and shook her head.
Opening up the spell, she willed the warmth inside of her through him.
His eyes closed as he breathed in the bit of internal fire she gifted him.
Myra knotted her fingers around his as she scooted to someplace comfortable.
"Don't let go of me and it should keep going."
Those curls shifted in his nod, knocking about like a trail of ribbons in the wind.
Myra chewed on her lip and glanced away to keep herself from doing something stupid like grabbing onto them.
"Oh right," absently shaking her head, she yanked the blanket off her shoulders and placed it on top of both of their legs.
His remained curled up against his chest while hers crossed to match her attempt at a comfortable sit.
Wind as crisp as biting into an apple wafted over their faces and Myra took in a deep breath.
The smell of life flooded her nose, far stronger than anything in the College.
Blessed Maker, but she missed it, her heart knocking about at how stupidly happy the scent of smelting iron and latrine holes could make her.
"Couldn't sleep?"
she asked, her eyes darting to the man who fell quiet.
He sighed, "Insomnia.
I'm sorry for waking you."
"It's no problem.
As long as we don't wake those two," she placed a hand over her mouth and pointed down.
"But I've all but run back and forth up here and Dad can sleep through anything.
I'm surprised he didn't miss the blight by taking a nap or something."
The poor boy snickered a moment, clearly struggling to feel beyond the rot where his heart had to be.
But the laugh passed so quickly, it may as well have not happened.
Why did she have to be so bad at this?
His mom, she was the one who was good at all this stuff.
Healing the pains.
There was a day in her early training when Myra was so stupidly homesick, she wanted to puke in a bucket.
She tried to suck it up because she did not want to deal with the wrath of her mother for being kicked out.
But Lady R took one look at the teenage girl barely able to smile and called off the lessons for the day.
It was a bit weird to sit with someone as old as her dad, but she made it easier.
As dumb as it sounded, rather than wait for Myra to spill her guts while leaving her alone, Lady R invited her to help make cookies.
By around the scooping one half of a spoonful onto the sheet and the other into your mouth, Myra came clean.
There were less tears with so much dough jammed in her mouth.
Too bad she didn't have any cookies, or baked goods in general to cram in there now.
"How are you doing?"
Myra whispered, her eyes darting away from her own handful of memories to the man under a deluge of them.
"Really how are you doing?"
Gavin's white teeth flashed as he bit into his lip, right next to the new scar.
"It hurts.
It always hurts, even when...even when I feel lighter while I'm distracted.
Like," he shook his head and sighed, "like it'll never leave."
"I'm sorry," she said, her eyes honing in on their hands locked together in a bond of the spell.
Her fingers lay limply in his palm while he kept absently cinching up around hers.
"I can't even begin to imagine..."
So much loss in so little time.
He'd had what?
Four months to process his mother dying, and then at best two for his dad as well.
How cruel could the Maker be?
"Thank you," the voice she'd upgraded from a coconut milk bath to luxurious satin sheets whispered.
"For..."
Myra shook her head, fully lost, "for what?"
The man shrugged, "I don't know, I just..."
His amber eyes turned up and that same intense stare that drove right into her heart flared up, "I'm grateful you're here."
"Me too," she patted against the back of his hand sealed inside of hers.
Both of the friends turned away, Myra knowing a dumb blush was burning on her cheeks.
Ah shit!
She tried to tamp down on the spell.
If she wasn't careful her embarrassment could all but spark someone on fire.
It teetered a bit in her clumsy fingers, like a wind whipping a candlelight back and forth.
Screwing up her eyes, she finally managed to get it to an acceptable level.
"Are you here for the wedding?"
Gavin asked as if that was his most pressing concern in life.
Did he not even feel Myra messing around with the fire?
Focus!
"Ah, sort of.
The holiday too.
Mom insists I always come back for Satinalia..."
"Because it's your birthday," Gavin smiled and she returned it.
Few remembered, or made a big fuss, but he did.
Every year there'd be some silly little gift just for her birthday left on the agency's stoop or sent to the college.
Absently, Myra dug into her neck and shrugged, "I think Mom likes to remind me how much pain I put her through before I was even born.
Then she begins the long list of all the pains that happened after."
Gavin snorted at her deflection, but he sighed, "She loves you."
"Yeah," Myra licked her lips, "I know.
We just...we pick to show we care.
We're a very picking family."
Maker's breath, you sound like a dung eating moron.
Picking family?
What does that even mean?
Stop talking, if you stop talking maybe he won't flee in terror from your unending mouth.
The boy didn't leap to his feet and then leap off the roof to escape.
Instead, he shifted a bit closer to Myra, his eyes trailing along her neck a moment before he smiled, "I was surprised to see you still wear that rabbit fur."
"Oh," the blush erupted into a ten alarm fire, Myra tucking against the gap of her tunic as if the brown rabbit fur yet caressed her cheek.
"Yeah, it...uh.
It's really nice and soft.
But I didn't have much use for a cloak and everyone had these fancy robes in the college with buckles or bits of flair festooned across them.
So I thought that I could maybe repurpose the rabbit fur as a collar and then...um, wear it all the time?"
Shit.
Did that look bad?
Like she hated his gift?
The cloak was nice, plain but she didn't mind that.
It just had a habit of frilling out behind when she ran, and you were kinda touched in the head if you wore a cloak inside all the time.
With the robe she could nestle against the fur whenever she tried to doze off in class.
Gavin smiled to himself, "I'm glad that you like it."
"I do, it's..."
It makes her think of him.
Even when she's not supposed to, sometimes when she's really not supposed to, but he pops in there.
Like an old bottle bobbing in the sea, nothing could sink it.
Which was not something she should say to him right now.
Or maybe ever.
"It's very warm, and nice.
I already said it was nice, didn't I?"
"There's nothing wrong with nice," he said softly before a great smile rose on his lips.
More infectious than the blight, Myra began to chuckle at his little joke and reference to himself.
She meant it as much now as ever, he was so damn nice it could hurt.
Hurt her heart more than anything.
"Will you..."
Gavin extended his leg out and began to sway the tip of his unshod toe back and forth, "Will you be returning to the college after the prince's nuptials?"
A simple question no doubt for him, but Myra pursed her lips in consternation.
He watched her reaction and added, "You don't have to tell me if you don't wish to..."
"No, it's..."
Myra ran a hand back through her sheared hair and groaned as it fanned out against the nape of her neck.
"I don't know.
My research is nearing its end, what I've gotten to at least."
Gavin nodded his head with her.
