In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

He set a bowl in front of each of them that contained a small crunchy biscuit.
On the top was a clear golden pool of honey that dripped down the sides of the biscuit.
Sliced fruit floated around the bottom of the bowl in a moat of cream.
"The old governor was kind and fair," Caedman said.
"He let us elect a council of village elders, valued their wisdom, and accepted their advice.
But the new Governor only listens to the men who came with him.
No one can understand why the King sent us this man for our leader."
Toby hesitatingly tasted the mixture.
It was delicious.
He took another large bite.
This was nothing like the stuff they served in the school cafeteria.
"You could rescue Berren," Marnie said softly.
Toby choked and looked up to see Marnie staring at him.
He swallowed hard.
"Me?"
he squeaked.
"You're not from here," she said.
"What does that have to do with anything?"
he asked.
His appetite had left him.
"You have the ability to travel back to your world.
You could sneak into the shed and take Berren back to your world with you," she said excitedly.
Toby looked appealingly at Caedman, hoping for a way out.
Caedman sadly shook his head.
"You cannot go in pairs.
Only one can pass through the portal at a time."
He relaxed, and took another bite.
Marnie slumped back disappointedly.
"How many people are guarding the shed, Marnie?"
Caedman asked.
"Two at a time.
They stay in the cabin.
I'm afraid that the Governor will question Berren and send him away."
Her voice trembled and a tear rolled down her cheek.
Caedman put his hand on her shoulder.
"Do not fear.
Your friends will help you.
It is getting late.
You must both go home, or you'll be missed.
After dark, we can meet and discuss our plans.
Come back here two hours after sunset.
I have a plan that I will share with you then.
Are we agreed?"
Marnie said, "I'll be here."
They both looked at Toby.
He slowly nodded.
"Then it's settled," Caedman said.
Toby once again found himself outside the public library breathing in the pungent perfume of the purple lilacs.
It was still early enough for him to stop by Alice's and pick up Janie's order.
Unnoticed, a slim shadow with long hair stood watching from the upstairs window.
There was a faint twinkle at her throat as something caught the fading rays of the sun.
Her long skirt brushed against the casing as she turned and slipped between the stacks of books.
Questions swirled through Toby's mind as he raced up the street and around the block.
Why did I agree to go back tonight?
I was looking forward to a weekend without worrying about BAM, and now this.
What am I going to do now?
How do I get out of this?
He slowed to a walk as he came around the corner.
In front of him was an old adobe building that had once been a saloon.
On the roof was a large fiberglass mushroom.
It was tilted towards the street with the store's name on the top.
Alice's Wonderland Cafe & Food Emporium Better Living through Better Eating
Well, that's a matter of opinion Toby thought.
In the side yard there were several round tables where the lunch patrons hung out.
In keeping with the wonderland theme, they too were painted to look like mushrooms.
Swinging doors had been replaced with a real door, and the entire structure was painted the typical salmon color of the southwest.
White patches showed through in several places where the faade had crumbled off.
An overhang extended over the doorway supported by evenly spaced wooden beams.
As Toby entered the store a metal bell clanged noisily on the inside of the door announcing his arrival.
He passed by the bins along the wall that were filled with an assortment of strange mushrooms.
Fungus among us, Toby thought.
Cheeses from around the world were piled haphazardly in hanging baskets.
Along the other wall in neat orderly rows were earthenware crocks of tea and small burlap bags filled with coffee beans from different countries.
The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the room.
Too bad it doesn't taste as good as it smells, he thought.
Hanging beads covered a doorway in the back.
Just in front of it was a long, highly polished counter that had once served as a bar.
The front of the counter had been converted into a myriad of shelves that were now adorned with spices and exotic herbs.
Toby made his way to the counter.
A bowl at one end held small purple peppers next to a carafe of freshly brewed coffee.
He was just leaning over to examine the peppers when he heard the soft rustle of the bamboo beads.
He looked up to see Alice standing behind the counter.
"Ah, Toby.
You're very late," she said.
"I thought maybe you forgot."
Tiny mushroom earrings wiggled as she moved her head.
"Yes, late for a very important date," he recited dutifully.
He was rewarded with a big smile and a giggle, which made her tiny mushroom earrings bounce and sway.
She reached under the counter and pulled out a bag.
"Here's your grandmother's order.
Oh, and something for you."
She opened a large cookie jar that was shaped like a white rabbit holding a pocket watch.
Pulling out a large cookie, she handed it to him."
"Thanks," he said with a smile.
"What kind is it?"
"That would be telling," she smirked.
"Let's just call it Friday Surprise."
More natural ingredients he thought ruefully.
The bell clanged and an old man walked in. Toby saw his opportunity and said, "I gotta run or Janie won't have this stuff for her salad tonight."
He hurried out.
There was a brown jeep and a car parked in front of the store.
As he hurried around the back of the car he came face to face with a bulldog.
It barred its teeth and growled.
Toby stopped and tentatively took a step.
The dog barked and growled again.
Toby impulsively tossed it the cookie.
"Alice's Friday surprise," he said.
The dog caught the cookie in mid air and chomped it down.
He then noticed with relief that the dog was tied to a pole.
Probably belongs to the guy in the store, he thought.
The dog wagged its tail slightly.
Toby took another step and the dog let out a muffled woof.
"You're welcome.
It'll be our secret," Toby said.
He hurried past and headed home.
CHAPTER 4 - CATCH A FALLING STAR
Toby arrived home before Janie.
There was a note on the table.
Toby,  Put the lasagna in the oven at 5:00.
I hope you remembered to stop by Alice's.
Be sure to do your homework.
Love, Janie
He looked at the clock.
It was 5:10.
Well, close enough.
Hurriedly he turned on the oven and slid the pan of lasagna onto the oven rack.
As he set the temperature, he thought a moment, and then bumped it up ten degrees to compensate for the late start.
He rushed upstairs to his room and threw his pack on the bed.
On the dresser, his latest mineral project was growing on an old dinner plate.
It had a picture of a loaf of bread in the center surrounded by sheaves of wheat.
Green crystals spread across the bread making it look like it had sprouted mold.
Next to the plate was a shoebox with a butterfly cocoon nestled in one corner.
He looked it over carefully, but so far there was no sign that the butterfly was ready to emerge.
As he dumped the contents of the backpack on the bed, Worlds Within fell out on top.
He carefully picked it up and put it on his desk.
Turning on his computer, he checked his e-mail.
This time his mom had written.
She wanted him to write and tell them all about school and his new friends.
Was he eating well and getting enough sleep?
How was he getting along with Janie?
He wrote back and told her about science class, Janie's salads, and that he was learning to play basketball.
Then he opened Pete's message.
Cute story.
Giving up on sports and planning on being a writer are you?
Maybe the stress of the new place is getting to you.
What you need are some good solid friends to keep you straight.
Someone like me.
Try spending more time with Jason.
He sounds like a pretty sensible kid.
So what really happened when Carson came back?
