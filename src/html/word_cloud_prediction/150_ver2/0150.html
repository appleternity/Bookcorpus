The Title is applied to a Name (surname or full name) and often designates their rank within a man-made institution (e.g. chief, king, bishop, brother) or general social status (mr., miss), or may indicate a kinship relationship (cousin, aunt). Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.' 'Everyone stood as Captain Jack Aubrey delivered a toast.' 'Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is sticking to his guns .' 'Captain Mike Eruzione of the USA Miracle on Ice hockey team in 1980 turns 58 today.'  Most LUs of this frame are related to LUs of the Leadership or Kinship frames, but some (e.g. Lady, Mr., Brother) occur only here.

This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Bringing', 'tfidf': 1.0152328461027194, 'lexical_unit': 'bring.v / lug.v / wheel.v', 'definition': "This frame concerns the movement of a Theme and an Agent and/or Carrier.

The Carrier may be a separate entity, or it may be the Agent's body. The Constant_location may be a subregion of the Agent's body or (a subregion of) a vehicle that the Agent uses.  'Karl carried the books across campus to the library on his head.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library in his truck.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library by truck.' 'The truck carried the books across campus to the library in specially designed boxes.' The  FEs include Path, Goal, and Source.

Some members of the frame (e.g. grow.v) tend to emphasize a gradual change, while most members of the frame do not indicate whether a change is gradual or not.    'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Documents', 'tfidf': 0.9071188102580178, 'lexical_unit': 'deed.n / accord.n / diploma.n', 'definition': "Words in the frame refer to any Document that has a legal status or conventional social significance.

A Weapon used by the Assailant may also be mentioned, in addition to the usual Place, Time, Purpose, Explanation, etc.  Sometimes a location is used metonymically to stand for the Assailant or the Victim, and in such cases the Place FE will be annotated on a second FE layer.

However, the frame itself is intended to cover situations with arbitrary Final_quality types.  As such, frames describing simple state change should inherit from this frame, incorporating the Final_quality FE as part of the background meaning of the frame."}, {'frame': 'Locale_by_use', 'tfidf': 0.8524385525988897, 'lexical_unit': 'lab.n / laboratory.n / courtyard.n', 'definition': "Geography as defined by its use.

This frame answers the question of how something is to be attempted, rather than what is being attempted.

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

'There are several accounts of the stench drifting to shore from the ships in the middle of the river'  'Dust particles floating about made him sneeze uncontrollably.'  'The grill, unsecured, rolled a few feet across the yard.'  'The swarm went away to the end of the hall.'  The frames that inherit the general Motion frame add some elaboration to this simple idea.  Inheriting frames can add Goal-profiling (arrive, reach), Source-profiling (leave, depart), or Path-profiling (traverse, cross), or aspects of the manner of motion (run, jog) or assumptions about the shape-properties, etc., of any of the places involved (insert, extract). A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'  This last type is annotated in the simple Motion frame."}, {'frame': 'Board_vehicle', 'tfidf': 0.7570346338308634, 'lexical_unit': 'mount.v / embark.v / embus.v', 'definition': "A Traveller boards a Vehicle that they intend to use as a means of transportation either as a passenger or as a driver.  'On the 5th of December, 1834, we embarked on board the merchant ship Hellespont.'  'She boarded the train ahead of him.'  'On 19 September the battalion embussed and headed southward into the Swordfish training area some 40 miles away.'"}, {'frame': 'Cause_motion', 'tfidf': 0.755334912712704, 'lexical_unit': 'launch.v / force.v / drive.v', 'definition': 'An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

She won't leave him alone, it's a stupid move but she's actually brave enough to think she can pull it off".
He lowered his hand and cleared his throat just watching for the director's response.
He gave up his allegiance to the Palace the moment Gordon confined him to quarters and told him to 'shut up and stay out of it from this point on because he'd messed up so much already'.
All the Curator wanted was to play with the important players, the one's that made the decisions and ran the show.
He believed he was on his way when he was promoted to Library head but after years of isolation he again thought he would win his way back into Gordon's good graces when he discovered Lily's unique blood properties, but again that wasn't enough.
So he schemed and talked and schemed some more, finally breaking out of his confinement.
No one cared about him anyway, no one would miss him so he decided to try Gentech.
He wanted someone to listen to him, why else would he be here betraying Lily and Axel like this.
The director considered the Curator a little longer while a snigger or two could be heard around the table.
"You seriously think she's going to try for the Palace.
I thought she didn't know anything about her background".
"She doesn't" said the Curator "but he does" he said as he pointed to the corner of the screen showing the spot where Jason was carrying Lily away to safety.
"He's a Palace boy.
My guess is he's going to help her get Axel out".
The director looked from the Curator to the screen and back again.
He didn't trust this man, didn't trust anyone that switched sides, but at this point he didn't have anything else to go on.
"Anyone else got anything to add" said the director.
Everyone at the table was quiet.
The remote viewers had been relegated to another room as their skills were being thwarted and tracking the girl was unsuccessful.
Their squad of beasts were all but dead and his options at this point were all out combat with the Palace trying to get to the girl or using the Library man's input to form his next plan.
Fantastic, thought the director, who would love to have my job right now.
"OK, this is what we are going to do.
Send a Gentech squad to the Palace keep it under surveillance and watch for the girl and her companion.
We see them, take the girl, before they have a chance to enter the Palace.
The Esperanzi stays on her tail - we need him to confirm that they're heading to the Palace".
He turned to the Library man "you had better be right about this" he whispered as he turned to the guards and ordered them to take Library man to his quarters and keep him confined until further notice.
Lily
Jason wouldn't start the 'talk' until I had something to eat and drink.
I guess he needed time to collect his thoughts.
I hadn't slept very well, although the term log comes to mind every time I tossed and turned and noticed Jason beside me.
He looked refreshed, chipper and was even smiling this morning.
"Where do you find the energy to smile" I asked as I looked at him through sleep deprived, blood shot eyes.
He just grinned at me mumbling something about a really good night's sleep.
We were still in the motel room, the light shining in through the window actually made me think it might just turn out to be a normal day.
Just for a moment anyway, nothing about my life felt like it would be normal ever again.
"Earth to Lily" that's what I heard before I felt Jason's ridiculously big hands waving in front of my face.
I slapped them away wanting him to understand that I was not sharing his 'big smile, I had lots of rest' mood.
His expression sobered as if he picked up on my mood.
"It's time to talk...We know what's coming for us Lily so we really need to figure something out quickly.
We can iron out any details and pick up any supplies on the road if we need them".
He paused, looking at me.
Actually it wasn't so much a look as it was something between a stare and a search.
"You know, if you just let those walls come down Lily, I could pick your mind and understand more about what your face is doing right now".
Well, that got my attention "excuse me" I said, "let the walls down, what walls.
And what's wrong with my face".
He's grinning again.
I suppose at a different time, in a different place that grin would be quite charming but right now my hand was itching to smack it right off his face.
"Your face is all contorted and serious looking.
You've been frowning since you got out of bed".
So I poked my tongue out at him.
It wasn't the most mature action I could think of, or even the most threatening but it's just what happened in that moment because by now I was sitting on my hands to stop them from doing something more drastic.
Again, that grin.
"What walls" I asked again.
"Your mind, I can't get in.
You have these walls - it's the best way I can describe them - they contain your thoughts and your feelings and I can't get past them.
And I'm usually good at getting past them, but yours are locked solid.
I can't get through so I have no idea what you're thinking so you're going to have to contribute, verbally, to this discussion so we can figure out what we are going to do".
Whoa.
Was my first thought, too much to process.
"My thoughts" I whispered "you're trying to read my mind, what the hell gives you the right to read my mind".
He looked a little stunned as he raised his hands to the surrender position "calm down Lily, that's what we do, read minds.
Most of us communicate that way.
I'm finding it hard to communicate with you, you're not giving me anything here.
Can't you just give me a break"?
I had to sit on my hands and feet right now.
I was gobsmacked.
So much so that I couldn't even process any of my own thoughts.
"OK" I heard him say "I'm not mind reading here, only guessing, you're pretty angry right now", he said "I'm beginning to recognise that look."
Yes, I was angry among a few dozen other things which is why I started to calm myself down.
It was Axel.
He was the one who had taught me to accept my emotions and not be ruled by them and around Jason I was beginning to feel ruled.
And around this time, remembering Axel I started to calm myself down, for this moment in time I'd forgotten all about him and remembering his words, remembering him brought back the realisation that if I didn't find him I may lose him forever.
"If you want to know something Jason, just ask.
You are not getting into my mind.
So stay out of it.
Ask me anything you want to know and I'll answer.
Can we please talk about Axel now"?
"But Lily, I need to read your emotions as well as...."
I hope it was my stony 'blink' stare that stopped the rest of that sentence because soon I would be tempted to pull down those walls temporarily just to let him know exactly how pissed off his mind reading crap was making me feel.
"Tell me about Axel.
Where are they taking him?"
I sounded a lot calmer than I really felt at this minute.
I figured getting into another fight with Jason wasn't going to help me help Axel and I just wanted him back.
Jason just watched me a moment.
He does that a lot.
I guess he's trying to get to those walls of mine.
"They'll be taking him back to the Palace" he said with a long drawn out sigh.
"Look Lily, I know you want to save him but I don't think this is a good idea.
In fact I know it's not a good idea".
He held out his hand at this point because I was about to interrupt with a few expletives.
"Look.
I promised Axel that if anything happened to him I would continue our original plan and take you to your father's home.
That's what Axel wanted.
That's what your father wanted.
There are a lot of people out there looking for you right now and the only way I can keep you safe is if we continue our journey to your father's home."
He paused here watching me, waiting.
I didn't immediately speak.
It took a few seconds for me to even understand how I was feeling right now.
Jason however was clearly indicating it was my turn to speak, well, here goes...
"I understand you made a promise to both Axel and the other guy, my father" It's a word I didn't want to use for anyone other than Axel, it's a word that made my stomach churn with fear about what was happening to Axel right now.
"But the short of it is I don't care.
Usually a promise is something sacred to me so I'm letting you off the hook here.
This whole thing, it's not your problem, it's mine.
You are just an innocent bystander caught up in something unimaginable to me.
So this is your cue to leave.
Understand that I'm not expecting anything from you, go back to whatever you were doing before you met me and my father.
No hard feelings.
I have to go to Axel.
I can't live a life without him knowing something terrible has happened to him.
I won't live that life.
For better or worse I am going to find him.
All I ask of you is that you point me in the right direction and I'll figure it out from there.
You've been amazing up until now and I'm never going to be able to thank you enough for your help but it's time for us to part ways."
Oh boy, where did that come from?
That's not what I had expected to hear myself say when I answered Jason.
I was looking at my feet now playing with my toes.
I didn't want to look up, even I understood how cruel and heartless that sounded.
The air around me had turned perfectly still.
I couldn't hear or sense anything.
I still hadn't raised my head "Lily look at me".
No I thought and continued playing me my toes.
"Lily look at me".
No, no, no.
I'm playing with my toes, it's important.
So that's when his hand shot out and oh so gently raised my head so that I was eye level with him.
He kept his hand there, steadying my face and even though I tried to avert my eyes he held them in place.
My breathing became shallow; I think I was having a panic attack.
And still, he just kept hold of my eyes, not wavering, not speaking, not moving.
His expression was hard.
That's the only way I can describe it.
All his features hardened, his brow line, his cheeks, his chin.
And still he just continued to look at me.
It felt like an eon when he finally spoke.
"I'm not leaving".
He said and with this his expression started to soften.
"Yes I made a promise to take you to your father's home, I also made a promise to keep you safe.
And you are not getting rid of me that easily."
Impatience was starting to creep into his voice "you have no idea how dangerous the people who are after you are.
Not just the Palace but Gentech are after you as well.
Someday, by the way you will have to explain exactly why that is.
But for now you have to know, if they catch you Lily, they are not going to be kind - not if they are after something specific.
Axel for now is ok.
