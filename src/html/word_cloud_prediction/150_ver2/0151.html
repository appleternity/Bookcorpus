In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the  Connector remains to bind the two entities (either Item and Goal, or two Items), without creating a new entity.  'The robber tied Harry to the chair.'

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (‚ÄúSTRONGEST critics‚Äù; ‚ÄúMIGHTY uproar‚Äù).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.'

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (‚ÄúSTRONGEST critics‚Äù; ‚ÄúMIGHTY uproar‚Äù).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Sathamar is a dangerous man, and I think I know why.
They're all coming from him, aren't they?
He's a fucking terrorist and even if he isn't part of the standing army he makes a good mercenary.
Oh, you don't think he could do that, do you?
Snap out of-'     Horrified at what he was hearing Nazair pushed Calschtott back to the wall, faces pressed up against each other with every sinew in Nazair's forehead poking out.
His face was etched with hot blood and rage, but he couldn't strike Calschtott, no matter how badly he tried.
Calschtott grunted through gritted teeth while pinned to the wall.
'He's making it up, it doesn't make sense otherwise.
There is no "nature spirit" watching over us, it's mental.
He's the source, his madness about this damned lake makes him such a perfect mercenary for Khan.
And what's worse,' Calschtott appealed, 'is he's been lying to you.
You used to be so wise but what might you become if you follow the likes of him?'
But Nazair simply dropped him, letting him crash onto the ground, walking off into the darkness of nightfall.
Calschtott hit the ground with a thump and groaned.
Spitting sand out of his mouth he got up, brushed himself down and checked for bruising.
He was now alone on the street and his thoughts came thick and fast.
Is he the ring leader?
Why would he launch raids on Carces?
How did this "brotherhood" come about?
Was there truth in all the madness?
Why was Nazair so convinced it was the right thing to do?
What did "human advancement" mean?
Stumbling back to the horse Calschtott looked into the distance.
The shadows of great trees could be picked out against the horizon.
He didn't like to think it, but something wasn't right.
Something in that mysterious place was calling to him and him...
The wind rushed past him and something small ran past his leg, jolting him forward, looking in every direction for some kind of assailant, afraid someone was trying to mug him, but the world was still again.
Paranoia, he told himself, mounting the horse and setting off toward the torch-lit glow of the fortress.
Chapter 3
Distant echoes were stamped out of existence to the tune of the click-clack of Calschtott's black cavalry boots down the arched corridor.
Silent serfs and jittery clerks evaded him whilst guards in full battle dress made awkward, armoured salutes when he passed.
There were rumours the king considered coming down to Carces within the month and that the council had objected on the basis that it was a risk to national security.
For the fortress, the implications were much worse.
If the king visited now the entire operation could fall to ruin.
He was still very much a newcomer to power whatever his supporters might say, so coming down here to visit during such a tense period may spark a war they couldn't win.
He was known for favouring shows of strength and power which was exactly what they didn't need right now.
Everything was quickly spiralling out of control and the events of a few days ago were now the favourite whispered rumours of the situation room.
Two guards flanked a large, embossed iron doorway at the end of the corridor and not another soul could be seen nearby.
The surrounding walls and ceiling held friezes of ancient battles and heroic generals standing on the bodies of the slain.
Today bred no heroes and Calschtott was thankful for that.
Two brisk salutes went up when he approached the doors and the guards pushed them both open.
Calschtott silently nodded thanks and stepped into the awaiting meeting, regretting it more and more with every step.
The more he had thought about it, the more of what Sathamar had said niggled at his brain.
The man was insane and a danger to the world, but he had Nazair in his pocket, and Calschtott could not risk his friend.
But maybe he had a destiny and maybe this territorial dispute went deeper than he knew.
The strange things he talked about, they messed with his mind but why would a terrorist reveal himself like that?
Most likely hot-headedness on his part.
Now he had to convince the collective he to remove this Sathamar from his sanctuary fast before he could corrupt Nazair wholly, which normally was quite difficult, except this time they thought it was the best idea ever and Carces was on full alert.
'Ah, lord marshal, you grace us with your presence.'
More poncing about from Vass.
Calschtott took the third high-backed chair of three facing into the great round table, the one to his right occupied by Vass and the one next to that left empty in the absence of Orrn, whilst other lower officers sat facing into the centre.
The large table was strewn with various documents, maps and charts detailing trade routes, action plans and security arrangements, signed and stamped by the seal of both his and marshal Vass'.
'I couldn't miss something of such importance, especially not when I bring the news.'     'Indeed, and what fascinating news it is.'
The collection of officers, from captains to the odd general, quietened down and stopped their various conversations, now waiting like vultures to snatch up Calschtott's statement.
They all knew what he had to say but only in the vague sense that he had acquired new intelligence on insurgent movements.
The eyes turned to him like twelve traps on a mouse, eager with mechanical hunger.
'As you all know', he started, trying his best to be authoritative, 'the recent raids upon this fortress and the outlying camps have drawn much attention for their frequency and efficiency, but there has never been any evidence to suggest they were linked.
However...'
He now had the choice: he could confirm all of their suspicions and denounce the ring leader Sathamar as a monster and a threat, no matter how preposterous it was starting to sound to him, and in doing so doom his friend Nazair to the witch hunts of the Southern Fronts Deployment, the worst betrayal of someone who had saved his life, or throw them a new bone, a different lead that would take them somewhere else and leave Sathamar's little cult of strange pagans alone, but if they were the aggressors like many suspected, risk them growing in number and strength, threatening the entire region and putting the nation on a war front if they ever attacked.
'...
I have found that they all operate under a single banner.'
Hungry glares became heated debate.
Calschtott had always denied that they could come from the same place, so why the change of heart?
Men furiously floundered around, bits of paper in clenched fists as sceptics tried to counter the evidence with points of their own, shut down by those who said they'd known all along.
Even a chair made its way backwards onto the floor in the mayhem.
Calschtott stood up and planted both hands firmly on the table.
'Silence!'
A sudden void greeted him as all voices faded out completely, leaving them all staring at the marshal.
For once marshal Vass seemed to not be throwing a venomous look at Calschtott, turning his sharp nosed face to the twelve officers, etching the scowl into their collective retinas.
The men returned to their positions and peace was restored temporarily.
'I have made it known in the past that I believed the attacks were divided and erratic, but I have conclusive evidence now that shows my good lord marshal Vass was right all along.'
He expected a snide remark, but this time Vass was cooperating.
'Let me draw your attention to this.'
He pulled out a folded map and placed it so they could see.
It showed Carces on one end, the northern edge of the jungle and part of the water of the Carthidium belt, and just at the edge, circled in ink, was a settlement.
They all fixed their eyes on this and digested the information as best they could.
'Three days ago I attended a meeting in secret with someone claiming to be...'
How to phrase it? '...a government whistle-blower for the court of Que'tar.
I know, it seems unlikely at first but in times like these the Que'tarn court is making enemies.
Annexing western Carthidium, deploying troops on the borders, conducting covert operations against us, a nation at peace.
From him I learned a great many things about the crimes his state is willing to commit and the source of the attacks.'
His rhetoric captivated the minds of the officers and soon all were sitting, almost open mouthed, listening to the crimes listed before them.
He appealed to their hearts rather than their heads, knowing men of pride would be more easily swayed if their pride was hurt and duty was questioned.
He had never considered himself a speaker much but he just spoke and the words came streaming out, and they sounded right.
'Lord marshal, excuse me.'
A young captain from halfway round the circle piped up, a querying look etched onto his brow.
'You have always been against this idea, why...' the man flustered, 'all of this?'     'Upon examining the situation first hand I've noticed a distinct pattern in the attacks that previously was so well concealed it appeared random.
You see we've all been fooled by a very formidable organisation, not to say it comes from Que'tar itself, no, but a group of dangerous sympathisers have been taking the opportunity to cause damage and encourage a war that may not be feasibly won.
The group themselves have not made themselves or their name known, but I can assure you if we don't move now I can only imagine Khan will take advantage of this.'
More quiet gossip rose from the gathered officers and Vass turned to Calschtott and whispered in his ear.
'You know I've never held you in much esteem, but I congratulate you, Hastur, you make... a good speaker.'
Vass' eyes betrayed a thieving look and Calschtott was convinced the marshal would attempt to steal as much of the glory as he could.
'I'm glad you understand I was right, we can start preparations as soon as we are done here.
Let's squash these insurgents before they can strike again.'
The words were oddly soothing and something Machiavellian stirred in his heart.
They say power corrupts, but they're all wrong; power turns your lies into truth.
The arrayed officers were nodding in agreement now and all gradually turned to him for guidance.
Spinning his lies and embellishing the truth, the reality dawned sickeningly upon him; Calschtott had doomed the only friend he had in this blasted desert to death and all over a petty rivalry with an old man.
He had been consumed by the situation and the reality was harsher than he could take.
A blizzard of thoughts and emotion whirled around his brain, consumed by the burden of duty and the debt of life to his friend, hounded by the voices and responsibility, but one thought escaped the maelstrom and landed squarely in front of him: he could still warn Nazair.
Betrayal or no, he had a chance to save his friend.
'Err... right, council adjourned.'
The abruptness caught them by surprise.
'Go.'     'Lord marshal, we haven't discussed-'     'I am aware we have not discussed the preparations, but that can be done later, I need some time for my own preparations, as I'm sure Vass does too.'
Vass looked puzzled when he was mentioned though he decided to nod along with Calschtott.
'Indeed, the lord marshal is correct.
Dismissed.'
One by one the meeting dispersed taking with it papers and maps and documents, grumbling back to their various offices and lobbies, leaving the chamber eerily silent.
Vass had got up and paced around the table, likely already planning his first glory grab.
Calschtott heard silence for the first time since he'd entered the room.
Now he had the feeling of absolute control, and he couldn't give it up.
Military action simply to save a friend he barely knew anymore, he couldn't believe he was doing this.
'I hope you're right, Hastur.'     'Don't worry, I'm certain.'
The sun was at its zenith over the scorched desert and not a living thing stirred on the sand.
The trees were still and the plants static, the rich mud below their feet was soft to the touch and the scampering wildlife hid deep in the brush.
Two pairs of sandal-wearing feet passed by unnoticed as the Carthidium jungle grew around them.
'That man is dangerous.'     'That man is my friend.'
Nazair, when will you see the bigger picture?
He thought to himself.
Sathamar had bigger plans for him but at this rate he'd spend all his time trying to squeeze the last of his moral objections out.
'He gets in the way of everything we stand for.
The man commands one of the most powerful armies in the world and you think he's going to just ignore us?
What were you doing letting him in on everything?'     'Cal knows me better than you think, we've shared a lot of history, and he's a careful man.
He doesn't like what he sees but he's not evil.'     'That so?
He seemed fairly rash then, quite impulsive.
I don't trust him.'     'We'll just have to live with that.'
The pair continued in silence and Sathamar took the time to embrace his surroundings.
The trees spoke to him, the shrubs whispered to him, they were more alive than ever and he could feel it in his veins like roots pushing through flesh.
It disgusted the human part of him to think like this, but he knew he was more than human now.
Things were accelerating, he was running out of time.
The Great Plan would go on ahead of schedule.
'Nazair, you make a very promising apprentice to me, but I think it's time we took things further.'
He studied his companions face and waited for the confused remark, but it never came.
'I had wondered what sort of secrets you'd been locking away.'     'Not secrets, we're not conspirators' tutted Sathamar.
'You know what I mean.
You wanted to test my dedication.
Well, here I am.'     'You need to know that everything we have ever worked on is leading to one ultimate goal: to make this world a better place.
You and I both know that the answer lies in our environment.'
Sathamar gestured to the vines, saplings, fronds and foliage around them and a breeze picked up around their ankles.
Bushes seemed to stir and shadows lurked in the tops of canopies.
Sathamar perceived this as nature's song, lighting a path to freedom.
'You are aware of the experiments I have conducted personally.
We have such a resource and we can make good use of it.
How much progress have you made?'
Nazair turned his left arm over and pulled back the robes to reveal a forearm that at a glance, a man might mistake it for hideous necrosis.
But Sathamar could see beauty in it, laced with wooden blood vessels and barky skin.
It melded pink, raw flesh with deep greens and browns of the forest, haloed in an orange glow of earthy light.
What was left of the flesh could be seen to be in flux, changing slightly over time as small pores opened and roots burst forth to bind with the skin.
'I have followed in your footsteps.'
To Sathamar this was a masterpiece of design.
