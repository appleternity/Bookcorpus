The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

I hate being your friend."
"Why?"
"Damn it, because of this."
Joe pushed him and Travis fell back onto the bed.
In one swift move, Joe was on top of him, one leg over Travis's legs, and one hand holding his chin so he had to face him.
"Because this is the way I want you... aren't you afraid?"
Travis shook his head and thought to himself, how can I tell you that the one I'm scared of the most, is myself?
He was doing his best to ignore the heat that Joe's body lit in his own.
"No, I'm not afraid of you anymore, Joe," he said.
Joe let himself fall onto the big comfy bed next to Travis and changed the subject.
"See?
It is big enough.
We can sleep together.
I challenge you to sleep with me for a whole month, if you dare."
"There is no use, I told you.
I won't change my feelings for you, even if we... share this bed."
"Then it's a deal.
All you have to do is come here after everybody else is sleeping."
"Sounds like I will be sneaking in." Travis lay on his side, his head propped on one hand.
"Are you taking the challenge?"
"First, tell me the rules."
"Which rules?"
"This challenge is like a game, isn't it?
Every game has rules."
Joe thought for a second.
"Okay, we can't touch each other."
"Each other?
You can't touch me.
I have no interest in touching you."
Joe turned on his side, so he could look Travis in the eyes.
"Travis, please be honest with me?"
"About what?"
"Are you sexually attracted to men?"
Travis moved his eyes from one side to the other, as if refusing to meet Joe's.
After a few seconds, he asked, "And you-- what about your relationship with Matt?"
"I asked you first, Travis."
"If you answer my question honestly, I might answer yours."
"Okay.
Matt and I met at college, lived together for six years and broke up ten months ago.
His fault, he was unfaithful to me more than once.
I can't forget or forgive that.
Your turn."
"That's it?
No more details?"
"There is nothing else worth telling."
Joe leaned closer.
"Travis," he prompted, "do you like men?"
After deeply sighing, Travis said, "Yes.
I feel attracted to men, but control it, because it's wrong."
****
Regardless of what he had thought when he first met him, that answer surprised Joe.
"It's worse to repress your desire and out it as rage against the world.
Think about it-- people concluding you're nuts, when you're really in need of some sexual release of the right kind."
He paused before asking, "When was the last time you had sex?"
"Come on, Dr. Freud, are you serious?"
Travis was playing cool, but his voice gave away his nerves.
"Travis, answer the question, please."
"Before Sophia got sick," he muttered.
The honesty he was getting from Travis was great, but Joe didn't want to dwell on anything for too long, afraid Travis would leave the room before they got a deal.
"There is no reason to be ashamed of that.
I've been kind of celibate for many months, because the idea of intimacy brought memories of Matt and his infidelity.
It was as if he had killed the pleasure of the act for me."
Joe silently added, Until I met you, and then, it was madness.
For having you, no matter what.
"Have you been with anybody else besides Matt?"
"Yes."
Travis sat on his ankles with an indignant expression.
"Were you unfaithful to him too?"
"No.
I spent months without sex after Matt and I were done."
"And?"
"Aren't you being too nosy?"
Travis laughed.
"Ah!
You don't like your own medicine, Dr. Freud."
Joe briefly laughed too, and with a serious expression said, "The sexual dynamic between men is different."
"Different?
How?"
"There is no dating the usual way, one takes what's offered.
The romance might come later or never come."
"Hold it right there.
So you got the chance of having sex with some random guy and took it?"
"Didn't you ever hear of a one night stand?"
"Yep."
"There wasn't any need to spend any more time with another man than necessary for a mutual safe and quick release."
"Mutual safe and quick release," Travis repeated thoughtfully.
"It sounds very therapeutic."
"Trust me, it is."
Joe's grin turned wicked.
"Would you like to give it a try?"
"No, thanks."
"But we're doing the challenge at least."
"Wait a second.
What about my children?
I don't want to imagine them finding us sleeping together."
Joe sat up and buried his face into his hands.
"Yeah, that would be terrible.
Not to mention Mom, or Mary."
"Well, it was an interesting project while it lasted."
Travis's relief was obvious.
Then Joe remembered something.
Rising to his feet he opened a closet and found a gadget that he dropped on the bed saying, "It's solved.
I'll tell my family that you're going to use my office to do the work you bring home, and this monitor will let us know if any of the children wake up in the middle of the night."
Travis looked at what Joe showed him.
It was a surveillance set of some kind.
It included a camera, with a small monitor screen, similar to a baby monitor.
"Are you sure?
I mean, will this detect noise too?"
"Yes.
It's noise activated, it will turn on if anybody passes by it.
We can set it at the bottom of the stairs."
"Why do you have this?"
Joe wasn't ready to share with Travis the real motivation for his interest in surveillance systems, so he told him the other true reason.
"We were being robbed at The Handyman, and I got a few of these to catch the thieves, and we did.
I brought this one home for Mom to use with Dad when she was in a different room.
He refused to be monitored like a baby."
"Only you could suggest such a thing to your father."
Joe shrugged.
"You haven't seen how it is when he's not feeling well.
We can use it, and if any of the children come looking for you, you will have enough time to get into the office, or go downstairs, before they get here."
Travis looked from the gadget to Joe and back again.
"Okay, let's give it a try," he said and quickly added, "And you, Joe-- what is your part of the deal?
If you can't touch me, how are you going to change my mind?"
"I don't know yet.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't say.
It would be like showing my cards, don't you think?"
"Agreed, but I don't get what's in it for you yet?"
Joe couldn't tell him that just seeing him made him happy.
And the idea of sharing his bed with him was very exciting.
He ignored Travis's question and instead said, "The challenge is that we will share the bed for a whole month, beginning tonight, and I can't touch you.
If I touch you in an intimate manner, I lose.
And if at the end of that month, nothing has happened between us, I must accept defeat, and become your friend with no teasing ever again."
He pointed at him.
"Your rule is that you have to be honest.
If you ever feel anything, you can't hide it.
You must act on it, Travis.
And that's my gain, if you will."
"What exactly do you mean?"
"If you ever feel like touching me or kissing me, since I can't do it, you are the one who must take the lead."
"And if I do-- emphasis on if-- what would you do?"
Joe raised his eyebrows in a speculative manner and grinned before he lay on the bed again.
"If you take the initiative, it means I've won."
He eased Travis down onto the bed and positioned himself so that each had a thigh pressed against the other's genitals.
At first Travis remained serene, as if it took him a few seconds to realize what the new position would do to his cock, then he gasped but said nothing.
"Don't worry," Joe murmured against his mouth, "I'm not doing anything now, simply answering your question."
They stared at each other for a few seconds Joe steadied himself on his elbows and made a couple of brief movements; enough to send the right message.
He leaned forward and whispered in Travis's ear, "If you ever kiss me, or touch me in an intimate way, I wouldn't stop until I heard you yelling-- Ahh, Joe, that's it, Oh!
Joe, Ahh!"
He basically finished the comment by faking an orgasm, tremors and all.
"You pervert.
