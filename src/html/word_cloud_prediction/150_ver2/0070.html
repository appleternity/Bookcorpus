This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'  'My life instantly changed from an empty life, to a life full of joy and purpose.'  'As you can see, the word WALK changed from red to green rather than have a separate lens for each colour.'

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Grasp', 'tfidf': 1.7505969125361363, 'lexical_unit': 'grasp.v / unintelligible.a / incomprehensible.a', 'definition': "A Cognizer possesses knowledge about the workings, significance, or meaning of an idea or object, which we call Phenomenon, and is able to make predictions about the behavior or  occurrence of the Phenomenon.

Although in both frames a Protagonist/Agent is not performing some desired action for some period of time, the use of wait.v in this frame is different from that in Holding_off_on in that Waiting prominently portrays a future event that will allow the Protagonist to proceed (with doing something), whereas Holding_off_on does not necessarily imply that there is some event or state-of-affairs that will allow the Agent to proceed, rather focussing on the action that the Agent is not yet taking.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

The lighting was so poor in here he felt like an old person in need of glasses.
As his eyes adjusted, his jaw opened and he said squeamishly, "Raina?"
This entire revelation gained him ten years to his looks.
It wasn't until he'd seen her in the light fully that he began to remember.
She cowered, taking another swish.
"Hi, how are ya?"
"Oh."
"Well, I guess he did technically win the bet, but we weren't really dating.
At least, we said we were.
But I just knew we were better as friends."
"What?
I'd never have guessed.
Well, Diana and I had a similar situation.
Except it was more of a guilt issue."
She nodded in understanding.
"Yup.
Nothing he did, nothing I did.
Just wasn't meant to be.
But I guess you could blame it partially on that awful dinner.
Now, was that your idea or his?"
He chuckled just a moment, afraid to answer truthfully.
"Oh, Raina.
I'm so sorry.
If it helps, we aren't exactly on a good page.
I think I'm getting all the little sayings confused.
We're still kinda fighting right now."
"What?
He never mentioned anything about it.
But I mean, we did break up right after that horrible dinner.
Oh, dear Lanta.
That was so bad."
Drew leaned back.
The bar was anything but crowded, and he wondered why out all the places in the world he would show up here for a Diet Coke.
Then he remembered how he'd been driving through the streets, thinking of how he should go over to Diana's and fight for her to the death.
He didn't love her, but maybe someday he would.
Yet something kept him driving on that warm afternoon, propelling him forward like some sort of manifest destiny.
Then he remembered all that had happened.
Nervously, he laughed, heartily and monstrous.
A couple sitting at one of the Formica tabletops turned to stare at him, and Raina raised an eyebrow.
"You okay?"
He continued to laugh so hard that he could feel his insides chortling.
Eventually, he stopped and had to cough.
"Oh, Raina.
I made this bet.
With God."
"Okay?"
she asked, twirling around a ring on her pinkie finger.
"I told him, 'I haven't been very nice to you, but send me where I'm supposed to go.'
And here I am.
At a freaking bar.
And then walks in Raina Newton, my best friend's girl..."
"Let me interrupt you there.
I am not his girl."
"You are his woman."
"No, definitely not what I meant."
"Well, what did you mean?"
She shrugged, twisting the chair just a little.
"Want to know something horrible?"
"Sure."
"I came to this bar, when I have been a teetotaler all my life, because my mom is getting hospice care tomorrow.
Maybe I'm just being sentimental, but, Drew, you should stop beating yourself up."
He almost said, "I'm sorry," but then he remembered how much he'd hated all the "I'm sorry" chitchat back when his own father died.
He paused long enough to clear his throat before catching just a glimpse of her out of the corner of his eye.
The broken light bulb pulsated like a vein above them, but in the glow, Raina looked very wise.
"So, we're in the same boat of misery."
"I wouldn't call it misery.
A lot of people don't get time with their parents at all.
I love my mom.
It's more of the fact that she was really rooting for Chris and me, you know?
But I always knew it would never work out."
It was like she was his favorite type of music.
The way she talked, the way she sighed almost constantly, like every statement was life-altering.
He tried not to stare at her too much.
He thought back to their first meeting, and how a wave of panic had crushed him in the undertow.
But of course, here he was, in an illicit situation yet again.
Did he only like women who had an intimate connection to his close friends and/or family members?
"I saw you once.
I was with my mom.
She told me you were staring at me."
He almost choked again.
"When?"
"You were on a date with this girl.
I can't even remember where.
You and I caught a glimpse of each other, and my mom made some comment about you.
I think she liked you, and she doesn't like people much anymore."
Every word she said was a melody, every breath a punctuated note.
He realized grimly that even though he hadn't had a sip of booze, his mind was befuddled with the dramatics of the past few months.
He wanted clarity.
"Raina?"
"Yes?"
"I remember."
Something caught in her throat.
The door behind them opened, a breeze following the guest.
Raina was quiet as Drew stared at her, and she finally caught his gaze.
"You remember?"
"Yes.
I never told you, but yes, I remember."
The way he said it, the pain in each syllable.
"I...
I should go."
She stood up, grabbing her rain jacket and purse.
"Raina?"
he asked, not looking over his shoulder.
He watched as the bubbles fizzled upward in his glass.
"Will you wait?"
she asked quickly, still standing above him.
"If this destiny stuff you're talking about...
If it's real.
Will you wait for me?
If we can stand it without the pain, and the guilt, and all the stupid reality?"
"Yes, Raina.
If it's right, I will wait."
She was gone, but a trace of her perfume remained beside him.
Chapter Forty-One
MID-APRIL, FOUR WEEKS post-breakup.
She didn't count the days.
She only used them as a guide to see when the last time she'd showed up was.
Raina knocked on the door at Aunt Ellie's apartment complex.
The old woman appeared, her long gray dreadlocks always so mesmerizing.
Raina tried not to stare.
"Rain!
We've missed you so much.
It's been a few weeks."
"Four," Raina stated simply.
"I'm sorry.
I've been between a rock and a hard place, but I'm here."
"Raina?"
called out Kelsey from the couch.
She sat by her computer, where she was talking into a little program that wrote for her on a Word document.
"No.
Erase.
Erase Raina."
Kelsey turned in her swivel chair and smiled.
"Where have you been?"
"Hey!
You working on another speech?"
"She's been busy on it for three weeks.
It's for a church thing in Dallas.
We're going to be leaving next weekend, flying out together for a little girls' weekend away period."
Kelsey's blue eyes sparkled.
"I'm so excited, Rain.
I wish you could come."
"Me too."
Kelsey's eyebrows furrowed.
"Oh, Rain.
I'm sorry."
"No, no, don't be.
She's still alive," Raina said, her breathing now erratic.
Aunt Ellie wrapped an arm around her shoulders.
"She's doing good, actually.
