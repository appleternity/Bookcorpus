Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.'

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. "giant electronics company") and those describing sound volume ("in a tiny voice", "the enormous thundering of her heart").  \'\'  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

"I'll say."
"Hull and I were prisoners of Clan Swordfish together.
They are one of the Sea Clans.
Ah yes," Gryme nodded, "I see by your expressions that you know of them.
Their language is Old Kroilen, which," he nodded to Sanych, "if had I told you earlier and you had recognized it as the Clans' tongue, none of you would likely have survived.
Swordfish is not known for their mercy.
Hull was one of their own.
He committed some serious offense, involving a woman.
I believe he spilled her wine onto her lap during supper.
The Clan sold us to slave traders at sea, and the traders brought us ashore to gather food for them.
Hull and I escaped the chain gang," he held up his wrist, indicating the manacle, "and were fleeing pursuit when the wave struck; that story was all true.
We would likely have been captured and killed if not for the sea washing in."
"How does that merit his death?"
Salvor asked, keeping his sword trained on Gryme.
"I had been captured off a Jualan voth-nai, a ship of leisure.
They are used by the cultural elite between the islands of the Jualan archipelago, to the northwest of Hynd.
Hull knew of this, and asked me many times, subtly, how much I was worth.
I am certain he planned to sell me back into slavery, or to one of the Jualan Houses."
"So, you're not Hyndi?
That whole 'give me a new name' thing was a show?"
Geret interjected.
"I am not Hyndi, and I apologize for the deception.
I did not trust anyone at that time.
As for being Jualan...our politics are rather complicated, and let me just say that any Jualan who would be willing to ransom me right now would only do so for the pleasure of executing me himself.
Please, gentlemen, believe me, I only meant to surprise Hull by pretending to take Geret hostage as well.
I had to act fast, or the princess would have been merely the first victim of your party.
"Geret, you have a quick mind, and I thank you profusely and with good grace; your perception allowed me to save your lovely princess, as well as myself.
My most profuse apologies to Princess Sanych; I never intended you harm.
I had no opportunity to share more details, and could only hope for this, the best of all possible outcomes."
He put his hand over his heart and bowed his head to them all.
Runcan spoke from behind Salvor.
"He certainly does speak like a noble.
He's nearly as flowery as you are, Salvor."
"And I'm not a princess," Sanych said.
"I'm an Archivist."
"I'm afraid I don't know that term," Gryme said.
"It means I'm more valuable," Sanych said, lifting her chin toward Geret and meeting his eyes for the first time in days.
Geret smiled briefly and nodded.
"How about sharing your real name with us, then?"
Salvor asked.
"As a sign of good will and all."
Gryme paused and looked down at the stone dock for a moment, and Salvor grinned darkly.
"That is fair; you have saved my life, not once, but twice.
It is only right that I entrust my fate to you further.
My name is Kemsil Urondarei, of the House of Jath, Keepers of the Celestial Calendar, and I am at your service, my friends."
"Geret Branbrey Valan, Prince of Vint," Geret said, stepping forward and gripping Kemsil's forearm in greeting, as if they'd never met.
"Geret!"
protested Salvor.
"Truly?"
Kemsil asked.
But Geret merely grinned, nodding, and added, "And this charming example of wisdom is Lord Salvor Thelios."
Ignoring Salvor's heated glower, Geret went on to introduce the others in the party by their full names.
The issue of what to do with the Cuttleboat was the first thing they dealt with as a new, cohesive group.
Sanych wanted to leave it as it was, saying it was a unique craft.
Kemsil was of a mind to try and sink the thing, so no one would know they'd arrived and ask questions.
Geret and Runcan formulated a quick plan.
"I'll take Sanych to meet the caliph," the Count said, "and the Cuttleboat will be our gift to him.
Letting him think we have such amazing craft is perhaps a lie of omission, but what wonders it will do for our reputation at court!"
They dropped the Cuttleboat's rock anchor and bade farewell to the trusty vessel.
"Let's get off this dock, shall we?
Before someone else shows up and tries to kill us," Geret said, clapping Kemsil on the shoulder and heading for the elevator system.
"I'd like to get home in one piece."
Kemsil smiled and joined him, the others not far behind.
Salvor sheathed his sword, looking mildly annoyed that he wasn't allowed to kill Kemsil for threatening Geret.
"Feel free to stab Hull a few times, Salvor," Geret called over his shoulder, "before you kick him into the harbor, if it'll make you feel any better."
A few moments later Geret heard a splash and grinned.
Dozens of elevator entrances were cut directly into the rock of the far wall, across nearly thirty paces of the harbor's stone dock.
Many were hidden from view by the mass of dead ships and docks.
Of those that were visible, most had splintered wooden cages and frayed rope ends dangling into view, if there was anything visible in their entrances at all.
The clearing crew had freed and repaired half a dozen of them, however, and it was to one of these that Geret strode.
Once everyone was inside, Kemsil lowered a bamboo gate attached to the front of the elevator's cage, then ratcheted the long metal bar into the up position.
"How far up does this go?"
Salvor asked, with uncertainty in his voice, as he gazed up into the darkness of the shaft overhead.
The elevator lurched into motion, and everyone grabbed at the inner rail for support.
"Several hundred feet," Kemsil replied.
"Lesser Salience is the bedrock that supports Greater Salience, where the Citizenry live.
It is a city unto itself, carved from the living rock.
We will find shelter there; all walks of life are accepted in Lesser Salience.
Embraced with open arms, even."
Kemsil grinned in fond remembrance.
"As long as no one tries to kill me, I'll be happy," Geret commented.
A few moments later, Kemsil said, "It seems you are determined to head for your home, Geret, whilst I will do everything in my power to stay away from mine.
And yet we both find ourselves stuck here in Salience."
Geret nodded and stared up into the blackness of the shaft, feeling the elevator cage rumbling upward.
He hoped that someday soon, he could begin to grant himself redemption for the loss of the quest.
For the hundreds of Vintens on board the Kazhak, and for the now-inevitable loss of his cousin Addan.
At the top of the shaft, a pair of guards who were trying their best to get drunk asked them a surprised question in Hyndi, which Kemsil parried with a laughing reply.
As the guards chuckled, he led the group past them, away from the enormous row of elevators.
They followed him through the hypogeal streets of Lesser Salience, down broad curving avenues and across carven squares supported by dozens of white marble pillars.
Every street and intersection had on its high ceiling the same dim yellow glow that brightened the harbor far below them.
There were many denizens of Lesser Salience still out and about at the shops and taverns, and raucous laughter echoed down the alleys from nearly every direction.
"Does this town have such a thing as peace and quiet?"
Salvor wondered aloud, as they turned a corner into a broad street with only occasional light from above.
"No," grinned Kemsil, as he stopped and knocked at the third door on the left.
After several long moments, the door opened, and a woman's face peeped out cautiously, her curly brown hair framing an oval face set with dark-lashed brown eyes.
When she laid eyes on Kemsil, she breathed a Hyndi oath and shut the door quickly.
Salvor and Geret had time to exchange a glance.
They heard the rattling of a door chain, and then the woman flung the door wide open and launched herself into Kemsil's arms.
"Kemsil!"
she exclaimed, kissing him on both cheeks.
He wrapped his arms around her in return, catching her waist-length curls in his hug and holding her off the ground.
Runcan cleared his throat.
Kemsil grinned and apologized, setting the woman down.
He began speaking to her in Hyndi.
After a few exchanges, she waved her hand invitingly to them all and backed into the residence.
"We may stay with her tonight," Kemsil said.
"Her name is Anjoya, and she is a hostess.
Here in Lesser Salience, that means a great variety of things, including the fact that she has a large home for conducting parties and meetings, so there will be more than enough room for us."
Anjoya seemed to have no end of well-appointed sleeping chambers in her home, and with a graceful gesture and a kind smile, indicated one for everyone in turn as she led them down one of her hallways.
She let Kemsil translate for her, and gave him the last room on one side, next to Salvor's.
~~~
When everyone else had slipped gratefully into their rooms and closed the doors, Anjoya stepped close to Kemsil and whispered in Hyndi, "You know you are not required to stay in your own chamber this night."
Kemsil smiled appreciatively, but shook his head.
"I am afraid I cannot visit you tonight, Anjoya.
The banns have been placed."
Surprise entered Anjoya's wide, dark eyes.
"That soon..."
"I'm afraid my sara Alima was impatient," Kemsil said, using the term of endearment mockingly.
"It has been several weeks now."
"Weeks?
Then how..."
Her hand slid gently to his left wrist.
"Kemsil!"
she breathed, pulling up his sleeve and exposing the slavers' manacle.
"Is this some terrible joke?
Tell me she did not put this on you!"
"No, Anjoya.
This is not Alima's version of the marriage band," he said lightly, but she saw his smile did not reach his eyes.
"I am not wed yet.
There were, shall we say, complications, in getting to the chapel on time."
Anjoya's jaw slackened.
"Not wed, after the banns were placed?
But...the Aldib will kill you," she whispered, as if someone might be listening even now.
Kemsil merely nodded.
"Yes.
And I fear Salience might be too close to home to hide me well, or for long.
I do not know what I shall do yet."
"I will help you," Anjoya nodded emphatically.
"You possess qualities unlike those found in the rest of your House.
Don't shake your head at me, my lord.
I have hosted for them often enough at your recommendation.
I see the way they scheme and plot.
You are different."
"Because I am the third son of a minor cousin of my House.
I am a pawn, and can have no personal ambitions for myself."
Anjoya slashed the air with her hand.
"No.
You are different because you seek to better yourself without hope of reward.
Now come with me, and I will get that awful thing off your arm, and we'll see what we can do about hiding you."
