Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.' 'Everyone stood as Captain Jack Aubrey delivered a toast.' 'Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is sticking to his guns .' 'Captain Mike Eruzione of the USA Miracle on Ice hockey team in 1980 turns 58 today.'  Most LUs of this frame are related to LUs of the Leadership or Kinship frames, but some (e.g. Lady, Mr., Brother) occur only here.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar.

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

It was past 5 p.m., and they were done for the day.
He decided the time had come for him to step out of the car, cross the street, and wait by the entrance.
He pulled his hood over his head and peeked inside when a group of people kept the door open for a little while.
He saw another big group coming down the stairs.
While the door was still open and people were pouring out, he sneaked inside, unnoticed.
The lady at the front desk was busy chatting with a colleague.
He took the opportunity to climb the stairs up to the first floor, where the mayor's office was located.
Then he had to find some way to get in. "Good luck and help me God!"
he said to himself, now standing in front of the heavy wooden door that he had passed through some nights ago to find Alice hiding under the table.
Alice..., he remembered with a twinge on the left side of his chest.
But he had to forget about her for now, since he had a very hard task to accomplish.
Without knocking, Hank turned the knob and cracked the door open.
It was a large room, which featured a short hallway leading to the mayor's office, a compact waiting area in a corner, some open floorspace, and then the reception area.
Miss Martha, the mayor's secretary, was sitting behind her massive reception desk.
As far as he could tell, she was enjoying watching a show on TV, laughing softly from time to time.
This woman now sat between Hank and his goal.
He briefly considered whether he could just glide in behind the desk and slowly open the door to the mayor's office, but it looked too risky.
After all, he wasn't a little person.
He was starting to panic when an idea finally popped up in his head.
He pulled out his phone and called one of the offices elsewhere in the building.
Whispering, he said: "Hello, Mr. Dinky.
Mister Mayor is in an interview that's going to last longer than expected.
He wants you to send Martha home because he won't be needing her for the afternoon.
Thank you."
He put an end to the conversation before Mr. Dinky had time to inquire about his identity, then stood and waited.
Sure enough, a minute later the phone rang and Martha answered and had a short conversation.
Then she spent five minutes getting ready to leave, while Hank impatiently kept looking at his wristwatch.
Finally, she exited the room looking like a queen, with a majestic step and a raised chin, slamming the door.
Then she turned around and locked it.
Nooooo..., said Hank to himself.
As if the woman had heard him, she turned back and unlocked the door, laughing and muttering to herself: "Lock him out and then you'll see."
Once she was out of sight, Hank emerged from his corner and entered the reception area.
From there to the mayor's desk was just one step, which he didn't hesitate to make.
It was now twenty minutes past five, which only gave him 5-7 minutes to do the job anticipating no troubles and leaving 3-5 minutes to get out before the building was locked down.
Going to work right away, Hank sat down on the mayor's chair and pulled out the rubber glove Alice had given him the night before.
He put it on his hand.
It felt weird, cold and sleek, and didn't really fit to his hand.
It was too small, but the fingers were awkwardly inflated, too big.
Hank didn't allow himself to get lost in contemplation but turned on the desktop computer and pressed the glove's index finger over the screen, but it remained locked.
Then he tried the thumb, and again nothing happened.
Hank stared at the screen.
What could it be? he was wondering.
All the sudden, he breathed over the index finger and touched the screen again.
Magically, like a curtain being lifted in front of a stage, the screen started to populate.
"Heat sensitive, duh!"
he whispered.
Working fast, Hank coupled his drive stick with the computer's port.
His fingers were flying across the keyboard looking for something that might or might not exist.
But he could recognize it if he saw it.
And there it was, one folder solitarily hidden on the second hard drive.
He opened the folder, but found it encrypted.
"Shoogar," he whispered in despair, trying very hard not to say the bad word, a childhood habit that had stayed with him over the years.
He sent the folder flying to the stick, looking through other documents while the file was being transferred.
When it was three quarters copied, Hank heard hurried footsteps, heavy heels tapping on the marble floor, apparently coming straight toward the mayor's office.
While the doorknob clicked open, he had the deja vu feeling, but this time he didn't make it to the closet.
The closest thing was the open window behind the mayor's desk.

Wizzy waited for more than thirty minutes before he came out from his hiding spot, refreshed from a little nap.
He was wondering if he should go looking for Pepper, for the dog should have been back by now.
He had never done anything so powerful for a dog before, and he wasn't entirely confident.
All other sorceries had gone well so far except for one, and he wasn't even sure that single failure had been his fault.
The credits he had been given for the dog were recent, and he was wondering if it was too soon; maybe they hadn't been activated yet.
That was one of the weirdest things about credits, they needed to be activated by a certain machine, which was situated far away and pretty much alive, as far as he had been told.
Not wanting to wait any longer, Wizzy walked down the alley in the direction Pepper had gone when he left a while ago.
He missed his friend's padded back with its wide opening between the shoulders.
His steps were short and getting to the lake would take him longer than he wanted, even though it shouldn't be too far.
The light became dimmer and it got cold and dark in the blink of an eye; and - gosh! - he didn't want to be out but would rather stay in his cozy hole, eating nuts.
But peace doesn't come free of charge, one must work for it, it has to be earned.
In the past when he was younger, he didn't care much about peace.
Oftentimes, he would be the one to provoke a fight among mice.
Those times were rather funny to think back on now.
He had faced death on more occasions than he had fingers and toes, and yet he had never feared for himself or others.
Now he was running, and kept asking himself: Where is that dog?
Lately, Wizzy had noticed, Pepper had become more important to him than it was supposed to be.
It was all about the machine, he thought.
His life had changed because of the machine, which was giving him bits of happiness here and there, bits of love and friendship, and crumbs of power.
He was sick of it but had no choice in the matter.
"Soon, it will all be over," he whispered, leaping across the park towards the lake, which lay at the opposite end of the alley.
Through a bunch of dead flowers that remained standing erect in the center of a garden, he saw the silvery lake glittering in the blue light of the evening.
On the shore, he caught glimpse of a well-known silhouette.
It was Pepper.
Wizzy came closer to find the dog peacefully watching the waves that kept flooding the shore over and over again, "whoosh-whoosh, whoosh-whoosh."
"Pepper?"
he said softly.
The dog turned his head and saw the mouse, small and shriveled, standing on his hind legs with his front paws raised towards him.
"Hi," Pepper said.
"As I am looking across this lake, I remember the beautiful time I spent with my master before he complicated his life with that woman.
We would go in those parts at dusk.
I would run around and play with sticks.
He would sit by the lake, reading.
After a while, once I got sick of playing and my legs hurt, I would come and rest by him, watching the waves, trying to see to the opposite shore."
The dog fell silent.
Wizzy waited, but all he heard next was a short and colorful sigh.
"Pepper...," the mouse finally said.
"I know, I know, I shouldn't be so sentimental," the dog conceded, finally leaving his spot by the water to join Wizzy.
"Pepper," said the mouse again in a firmer voice.
"I have been waiting for you, I was worried."
"I'm sorry, friend, it took me awhile to make my wish," said Pepper.
Wizzy did not quite understand.
Pepper was supposed to throw the coin in the water and come back right away, as instructed.
Perhaps something had gone wrong when he made the sign on Pepper's nose.
Could he mistakenly have made the wrong sign?
"Did you make your wish?"
asked Wizzy.
"Yes," responded Pepper.
"When do you think my wish will come true?"
he then asked with a spark of hope in his voice.
Wizzy didn't answer.
Instead, he started walking back.
"We shall leave now," he said, taking the lead.
"Where are we going?"
Pepper asked.
"Back where we came from."
"Aha."
Wizzy was running, losing ground to Pepper, who was walking at his leisure.
"Do you need a ride?"
the dog asked casually.
"Yes, thank you."
The mouse jumped onto Pepper's back, landing on that wide padded spot between the shoulders.
They cruised along dark alleys and among thick tree trunks in complete silence.
Wizzy could hear Pepper's heart pounding.
They returned to the place where they had first stopped.
Wizzy jumped down.
"We should wait here," he said.
"This is the best spying site I know of in the whole park."
"What are we spying for?"
asked Pepper.
Wizzy didn't answer right away, being busy making a mountain out of dead leaves.
"Everything," he finally answered, seeming undisturbed.
Pepper lay down on the dried grass with his back against a small tree.
Wizzy positioned himself on top of the mountain of leaves he had just raised, facing the opposite way.
They had a 360 degree view, with all the main alleys and roads knotting together just steps away.
"We are the frontrunners, Pepper," said Wizzy.
"Whenever the bad guys are coming to spread their poison, we will be the first to find out.
Then we will run to alert the other communities to stay away from any contaminated spots."
"By the way," said Pepper, perking his head up, "I smell rotten eggs.
It comes from down there.
Maybe the wind is blowing it my way.
Are there any restaurants around?"
"No, there aren't," answered Wizzy.
"Besides, restaurants don't smell like that."
"You haven't been around any bad ones," laughed Pepper.
But Wizzy was already climbing up the tree while looking down the alley, where he saw two men walking in a hurry.
They were still far away, but fast approaching.
Pepper was on his feet, sniffing the air, excited.
"There come your rotten eggs," said the mouse, descending the tree.
"Let's follow them."
"Are you kidding?"
said Pepper.
"I'm too big, they'll spot me."
