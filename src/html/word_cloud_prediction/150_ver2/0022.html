The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

His feet futilely scramble for purchase on the lady's scalp, but he has been shaken too far forward, and slides past her forehead, plunging into the open portion of her dress, into the waiting cleavage between her ample breasts.
Now, like the poor bull of legend, Miss Larsen, in full-blown panic, begins to plow through everything in her way...and even though she is not in the proverbial china-shop, she still leaves a wake of considerable destruction through the tables and guests unfortunate enough to be in her path.
However, her flight is mercifully short.
Before she has covered ten-meters, she runs full into one of the palm trees and careens back on the soft sand, having knocked herself stone-cold unconscious.
From the folds of her dress, Marty appears between her knees, shakes his head, and sprints back towards Betty's table.
Betty has not been idle during this time, for actually less than 60-seconds have passed since this entire escapade began.
It was but short moments before that she made her grab for Marty, missing due to Struther's frantic struggles.
During the next dozen or so seconds, she has been kept off-balance by panicked, jostling patrons.
But now that she has her senses and balance back, her attention is on Struther, lying on the sand, eyes rolled back and exhibiting but the feeblest of twitches about his lips.
Betty jumps to the top of the table, shoving drinks and fruit bowl aside, and without hesitation leaps high into the air towards the downed man.
She lands on top of Struther, her elbow slamming with the full weight of her body into his diaphragm, just below the ribs.
There is the distinct snapping sound of bones breaking, and Struther convulses, his head and legs lifting off the ground...and with a loud woofing, cough-like bark, expels a wet geyser of spit and partially chewed peanuts high into the air.
He coughs raggedly several more times, but at least he is breathing, and that's all that Betty cares about at the moment.
She rolls off the convulsing man, sits upright and looks over to Kaman, also sitting on the sand, at last untangled from the waiter and the woman.
Betty shakes some sand from her hair and smiles.
"I can't believe I was once actually married to this asshole..."
Suddenly, Marty appears before her, sits on his haunches and regards Betty with a wide grin.
Fun!
"Well...I'm sure glad you think so!"
Chapter Two
"Holy frijoles!"
roared Sam, his laughter coming over the ship-to-ship radio clearly despite being several thousand kilometers distant.
"Sounds like total pandemonium!"
"Yeah," replied Betty, fighting the giggles.
"But without the pandas!"
She sits at the controls of her shuttle, the "Puddle Popper", piloting it back to the Flipper-Doodle, where Sam waited.
The Oort ball containing the Madeira colony lay far astern even though she left the docking bay scant minutes before.
Betty was anxious to leave the colony as far, and as quickly, behind as feasible--she longed to get back out into deep space...back to the frontier.
"So let me guess...the Peacekeepers showed up--" "Hell, yeah," she interrupts with a snort.
"Must have been twenty of them!
That someone hit their panic button doesn't surprise me; what would is if there was anyone there that didn't!"
Betty referred to the channel on all colony communicators, whether cybernetic or external, that placed an automated distress call to all nearby Peacekeeper offices once activated.
"Wow, kiddo...you don't do anything half-way.
I'm glad I wasn't there!
How's Struther?"
"They thought he was dead!
You should have seen him...lying there stiff as a goat's pecker; eyes wide-open...staring at the holo-cast of the sun!
I'll bet his retinas are scorched."
She joined Sam in renewed, uproarious laughter.
"And that bite out of his hand!
Like he was bleeding to death!
Marty must have mixed some sort of anti-coagulant with that venom!"
Marty, lying on Betty's lap, raised his head and opened one eye at the mention of his name.
But seeing his assistance wasn't required, or that there was no food, went back to dozing.
"Aw jeez, I hope he doesn't need a tetanus shot..."
"Who?"
cried Betty.
"Struther or Marty?"
They again howled with laughter.
"Betty, I have you on radar and visual," came the soft, feminine voice of the ships' computer.
"I am prepared to bring the Puddle Popper in when you are ready."
"Go ahead, Charlie," she replied.
"I have visual on the Doodle."
Charlie took control of the shuttle, steering it towards one of the bay-doors opening at the small ship's approach.
Betty grabbed Marty from her lap and headed back towards the hatch.
"But what the hell did you tell the Pee Kays?"
asked Sam.
"I mean...Marty's permits don't give him the latitude to go around biting people...even if they do deserve it!"
"Yeah, you're right," Betty climbed into the airlock and dogged the hatch.
"I tried to tell them it did...at least when someone attacks me!
Only problem with that...Struther was just sitting there!
Good thing the Cranston security team showed up with those lawyers!"
Once inside the Flipper-Doodle, Betty let Marty leap to the bay's floor and run beside her as she headed for the control room.
She stopped for a moment in one of the side rooms, changing into a clean shirt.
In moments, she and her husband were kissing passionately while Marty ran about their feet, chattering excitedly.
"I still don't get it," said Sam, giving Betty one last hug before returning to the main control panels, plugging the cerebral-interface cable into the socket behind his right ear.
"How did Claire know you needed help?"
"That woman thinks of everything," she said, sitting next to Sam.
Marty immediately reclaimed her lap.
"Little did I know she had been watching us since I asked her to buy the Oasis for me...no, no, don't ask, I'll explain later!
The attorneys had papers showing I was untouchable, seeing as how you and I are the sovereign rulers of an entire planet and enjoy full diplomatic immunity!"
Sam started to speak, but the woman had a hand over his mouth before the first word could be uttered.
"And said papers gave legal proof that the Peacekeepers had no authority within the Oasis as it had been registered as our defacto embassy!"
"Incredible, honey...you and Claire are amazing!
But what about Marty?
Is he perhaps listed as some official political emissary?"
"Better...since the survey teams have combed Xanadu from pole-to-pole and found no others like him, Marty is one of the most valuable...and most protected critters alive!
He is documented as a "sole survivor" of his species!
Neat huh?"
Sam shook his head in wonder as he and Betty shared a few last chuckles.
"All right...enough...so what about Struther?
He is going to recover...right?"
"Yeah...of course he is!
But the med-techs there couldn't snap him out of it!
After they'd all stood around for a while scratching their heads, they finally asked me if there wasn't something I could do.
So I asked Marty...and he went over and bit Struther again!
Right in front of everyone!"
"And he woke up?"
"You got it!
Sat right up, looked at Marty and scrambled backwards like a crab in a blind panic.
Damnedest thing you ever saw!"
"What about Wantanabe...why did he want to see you?"
Betty reached into a pocket and held up a small data-card.
"He said this would explain everything!"
***
Sam and Betty leaned excitedly over the control room's plotting/projection table.
A holo-cast of a desiccated planet slowly turned while they studied the details.
Beside the globe, a small-scale projection of the solar system displayed the sun and other planets, along with an asteroid belt.
The scale was such that nothing was shown beyond the outer-most planet.
"It's a main sequence G sun," said Sam.
"Ten planets...normal asteroid belt, nothing really unusual."
"You mean other than the fact the planet is almost a billion years older than Old Earth!
The sun's older and brighter than Sol too.
That's probably why there's no surface water...oceans have all boiled away via upper-atmospheric disassociation."
"Yeah...but look at these readings!
Atmospheric mixtures are hardly uniform even though the surface-pressure is still about Earth-normal.
Notice how the concentrations of oxygen, nitrogen and water vary wildly?
There also appears to be a correlation to geology...wonder what that's all about?"
"By the way," said Betty, suddenly changing the subject.
"How did your meeting with the Navy go?
Are they going to give us a couple of warp-doors or not?"
Sam exhaled deeply while running his hand through his hair.
"Bad news there...I thought they were being stingy because they wanted to release the technology slowly.
But then I talked with Doctor Lewiston and found out that not only have they refused to make the doors public, but they've also taken back the ones they gave to Claire!
That's why she and Doc haven't been back to Mars for a while...no warp-doors!"
"But why?
I thought those would be incorporated into the Leviathan as well as throughout Claire's company to assist with the colonization of Xanadu!
What made them change their minds?"
The Leviathan was a 50-kilometer Oort ball the Cranston Corporation had spent ten-years, and a large portion of its resources, converting into a monstrous, mobile base from which to initiate a "hostile" take-over of competing mining operations in the cloud.
Sam's last tour-of-duty in the Navy had been an assignment where he helped the Inter-system Navy's special-ops group commandeer the Leviathan as well as removing Claire's stepfather as head of the Cranston Corporation, then placing her in his stead.
"Can't tell ya, honey-bunch...I even tried contacting Admiral McNally.
But for some reason, he's never replied to my calls."
"Well...I thought that was the hold-up with the B.O.B.--the installation of the doors!
If we're not getting any, they should be done with our ship!
We can use it to check-out Kaman's planet!"
"That's what I thought, too.
But according to the dock-master, they encountered some problems...said the B.O.B. won't be ready for some time yet!
When I pressed him for specifics, all I got was the run-around!"
Sam paced for several moments, then continued.
"What about you?
What could they tell you about Marty?"
"Well the lab-boys thought he was the bees-knees!
Ran all kinds of tests on him...at least the ones he'd allow..."
"How so?"
asked Sam.
"Well, you can forget about drawing a blood sample!
Marty did not like that at all!
Did you, you scoundrel?"
Marty had raised his head to look into Betty's eyes at the repeated mention of his name.
Now, he did not return to napping, but began paying closer attention to Sam and Betty since he was the topic of discussion.
"But he didn't mind the x-rays and ultra-sounds," continued Betty, stroking Marty's head.
"Seems he has at least four sets of glands in his cheeks and tongue, perhaps more, that secrete an entire host of peptides!
He apparently mixes and matches all kinds of combinations: single chains, tripeptides, pentapeptides...all the way up to decapeptides...and all sorts of side chain protecting groups!
N-terminal protectors, t-boc'ers, protein-chains...even peptones and proteose mixtures--" She abruptly stopped when she noticed Sam's blank stare and his mouth hanging open.
"Sorry...I got carried away.
Let's just say he's capable of cooking-up quite an unbelievable array of organic, molecular soups!"
"And medicines?"
asked Sam.
He and Betty had been badly injured when the B.O.B. collided with a comet in the Xanadu system; Marty had healed their wounds with but a bite.
"Well, what we call medicines...antibiotics, for example...and after what he did to Struther, seems he can concoct venom and neurotoxins too!
