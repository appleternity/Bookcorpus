We have no families but each other.
We have no one but each other."
Dawson was taken aback.
Did everyone know about this but him?
"I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
I'll expect you to report to me in one hour, Lt. Madison."
"Yes, Agent Dawson," she replied curtly and was gone.
Dawson was a little embarrassed himself, now that he thought about it.
Of course with a link that made eight people into essentially one being they would be able to hide nothing from each other...ever.
Everyone did know about this, he realized, and because he wasn't Fleet, he hadn't been informed.
Well, it was a little strange, he'd grant, but if it delivered results like he'd seen on the surface, he could put up with their policy so long as they were really finished with their mission.
Dawson headed back up the lift tube to his quarters and started working on his report for Damon Harding.
When he was finished, he encrypted it and had it sent directly to Harding's companion.
He didn't want anyone to get even a glimpse of his findings.
After he sent it, he was just beginning to read over Lt. Madison's debriefing of the mission when there was a knock at his door.
It was her.
Dawson released the lock on his door and beckoned her in.
She was back in uniform now and looked all business except for a little redness in her face that was probably embarrassment.
"Agent Dawson, I'd like to apologize.."
she began, but Dawson interrupted her.
"It's not an issue, I simply hadn't been informed.
And if that is the price of your platoon's performance, then so be it.
We don't need to discuss it any further," Dawson said.
She looked relieved.
"Thank you.
You had an assignment?"
Now she was all business.
Even that slight reddening was disappearing.
"Yes, I'd like you to have you send two Marines to watch Terra Gates, I want to know what she's up to.
I suspect she will be trying to leave Mars shortly, and I'd like to know where she's going before she takes off."
"I'll have two men on it immediately.
Should they try to penetrate the Gates Family Dome?"
"No, just watch them if they leave...I assume that their camouflage won't deter you."
"No sir, their camouflage is less advanced than our own.
We can track them."
"Good.
That's all, Lieutenant Madison."
Dawson said, dismissed her.
She turned and left immediately.
Then he contacted the Captain.
"Captain, I'm having Lt. Madison send two of her Marines back to the surface to keep an eye on Terra Gates so she doesn't slip through our fingers."
"Why didn't you just leave them down there in the first place?"
the Captain asked with a little contempt in her voice.
"The situation on the ground is fluid.
I'm just trying anticipate their next moves.
I apologize for the inconvenience,"  Dawson tried to be diplomatic.
"Of course, anything we can do.
Do you expect us to be departing in the near future?"
"Yes, but..."
He began to say before she interrupted.
"Let me guess.
They are leaving, but you don't know to where or when yet, but you'll let me know."
"Exactly."
"We'll be ready to break orbit on your notice," she responded closing the connection.
The Captain had been getting more peeved at him as time went along and he took more control over the mission.
Dawson thought that wasn't quite fair of her.
He wasn't attempting to command the ship, just the Marines.
The snafu with the Marines reporting directly to him had sparked the whole thing off.
Hopefully she'd get over it.
But as long as she continued to do what he needed, he didn't care if she liked it or not.
Chapter 35
Damon Harding wasn't smiling when he received Dawson's report of the meeting in the vault.
He was concerned for the first time that he and the US might be in real danger from Storm, a danger far beyond what he had previously estimated.
Dawson was apparently on top of it, and understood the sensitive nature of the information about the antimatter.
Damon could trust him to be discreet about it as it would certainly end their operation to try and find Storm if other political forces assumed a seek and destroy mission.
As if the nanotechnology weren't bad enough, they had to throw a hundred kilograms of antimatter in to the mix!
What is Storm up to?
Is he going to bomb the restoration center?
Damon knew he couldn't call anyone about this and have the place evacuated it would start a panic and bring down the Fleet very quickly.
No, he had to let things go on, but when they had Storm, he would launch an investigation as to how that much antimatter could have been produced and smuggled without any one knowing anything.
Still he needed to do something, and apparently he was physically in danger at his penthouse.
There was no telling if Storm would target only the restoration center if he did use the antimatter as a weapon.
Damon needed a safer place until this was all resolved.
Julia, have The Golden Rule readied.
I want to be on orbit by evening, Damon ordered.
His ship The Golden Rule was newly constructed, built from the same design as the Powel, but it didn't need the number of crew that the Powel required and it didn't have all the armament.
From orbit at least he wouldn't have to worry about an antimatter bomb dropping on him from the sky.
It would give him some flexibility.
Perhaps the situation requires a little more personal involvement, he thought.
Damon knew he had underestimated Storm's potential, and now the stakes were higher.
He needed to be a player in that unfolding game in space.
Chapter 36
Sam was on the train heading to the spaceport.
Terra had briefed him on who his contact was once he reached the station and how to get there.
Sam was disguised as one of the safety inspectors for the Martian antimatter stations.
He was sitting in one of the window seats and there was no one next to him.
The car was mostly full but his persona looked a little menacing so people had avoided being too close, which was just fine with him.
He was excited to be given this part of the job all to himself, and he finally felt like he was contributing to the team.
He had contributed a little with the design of the cargo container lander they had used yesterday.
Of course, that seemed like weeks ago with everything that had been happening.
So he had done something, but he felt like the short leg of a three legged stool, needing to be propped up on something to keep them level.
But this trip would help with that.
He was the only one who had to go.
The others needed to figure out how they were going to get away once Sam found a destination.
The train made good time through the tubes and he arrived at the spaceport in under half an hour.
The spaceport was located twenty kilometers from Olympia, and there were two subterranean pressurized train tunnels that connected them.
When he arrived, the train pulled out of the masonry tunnel onto a platform at the base of the space port dome.
The construction here reminded him of the Houston Spaceport, only smaller.
It too was built with one major dome and outlying minor domes, but only a fraction the size of the Houston spaceport.
As he made his way up the stairs in to the main terminal to find the shuttle service that went to the Hyatain station.
He heard a rumble and looked upward through the transparent dome to see a rocket lifting off.
It was a little different here than on Earth.
Sam had been reading up on Martian space flight capabilities, and it seemed that it wasn't done the same as on Earth.
There were very few antimatter powered vehicles; they were mostly powered by methane and oxygen which were manufactured simply by having some hydrogen feedstock and using the Martian atmosphere, just as Robert Zubrin had proved possible so many years ago.
They got the hydrogen by electrolysis of the water from the sub Martian aquifer.
The rockets here didn't have the ultra strong rotors for landing.
They launched and landed purely on rocket power.
Once Sam thought it over, it seemed natural that it should be this way.
After all, there was only one third gravity here and still fairly little atmosphere despite the orbiting mirrors.
It would be centuries still before the Martian atmosphere really gained much density.
Until then, direct power launches and landings were easiest.
Sam found the Trans Mars express shuttle counter and picked up the ticket that Terra had discreetly arranged for his passage.
The woman working at the counter confirmed him on the six-o-clock shuttle that would take him to Phobos, and from there he would take another shuttle, one designed for space flight only, to the Hyatain station that was trailing Mars in its orbit by a half-million kilometers.
Once he had confirmed that there was space on the shuttle, he had Ralphie bring up a guide display in his visuals.
A virtual green band illuminated the floor in front of him that led him towards the spoke that went to launch pad Gamma.
The terminal was bustling with people moving all over the place because this spaceport also functioned as a transport to other cities located around Mars that were reachable by sub-orbital rocket powered transports which performed the same function on Mars as zip tubes on Earth.
Eventually, Sam supposed as he followed the green path, Mars would construct zip tubes as well, but the technology used to grow the tubes had not yet been imported to Mars.
The expense was still too high for the UMG government to afford.
Mars mostly dealt in low-tech real goods, unlike Earth which mostly dealt in high-tech equipment and information.
Mars supplied the belt colonies that were not self sufficient and the orbital colonies around the Earth.
They also supplied the Moon and some of the outposts on the Jovian moons.
This all occurred not because Earth couldn't do so but because it was more expensive to launch anything from Earth's surface to any of these places than it was to do so from Mars.
All of these low-tech goods were shipped by solar sails that never came closer to Mars than Phobos or Demos, the two small moons of Mars, which were too small to affect the sails adversely.
What got to Sam was that Mars could be producing their own high tech goods as well but most of what was considered high tech today was nanofactured and nanofacturing technology was strictly controlled and regulated and so far had been denied permanent placement on Mars.
There were always debates because Mars did contribute to the LNRC but only as a minor partner, and as such they were given nanofactured items from Earth but not nanofacturing equipment.
Eventually this would change but so far Earth had kept control of what they designated as dangerous technology.
The main argument against Mars having the technology was that they wouldn't be able to stop a nanotech disaster.
Which was probably true, but neither was Earth prepared really, though they liked to pretend they were.
Sam reached his shuttle ten minutes before it was due to depart and one of the attendants waved for him to hurry up as they needed to finish their check list before they took off.
Sam hustled a little and went out the ramp that connected to the side of the rocket.
The rocket was a Boeing design nanofactured in Earth orbit from asteroid fragments brought to the nanofacturing facility by solar sail from the belt colonies.
It was a strange triangular trade that had arisen with Earth shipping high tech goods to Mars and Mars supplying low tech supplies like food and so on to the belt colonies that shipped raw materials back to Earth, and some to Mars to be turned into more high and low tech goods.
The Boeing rocket had been built as almost one unit.
It was a diamondoid material that made up the bulk of the structure with two decks of passenger space and three rows of seats in concentric circles about a central lift tube shaft on each deck.
The top deck was the cockpit where one person monitored the SS system.
Below the two passenger decks was one cargo deck, and below that the fuel tanks that made up two thirds of the whole length of the rocket.
Then there would be the super efficient rocket engine.
The top passenger deck was full and the only available seat was on the lower passenger deck in the innermost circle of chairs.
A simulated window that took up half the wall, through it Sam could see the Martian landscape with Olympia off in the distance and a few other rockets sitting neatly near their smaller domes at the end of the long ramps.
This was how everyone traveled from Mars.
The larger passenger liners and bulk transports all went to the spaceport on Phobos where passengers would then take smaller shuttles like the one Sam was on to make the descent.
The liners and transports weren't designed to make a landing.
To do so would have needlessly increased their mass and expense.
"Welcome aboard Trans Mars.
I'm your Captain, Jim Alton, and we'll be ready to depart in just a few minutes.
Please make sure your are securely in your restraint chair and your personal items are stowed under your seat or down in the cargo deck.
I'll be activating the fog restraint system for the duration of the launch phase, which will last approximately six minutes.
After that we'll have a leisurely rendezvous with Phobos Interplanetary Spaceport by six-thirty local time."
The Captain announced over the intercom.
Some things never changed.
