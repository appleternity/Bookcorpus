In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

"La!"
sang the little organist, giving the note in a long, melodious call.
He raised his hand, gave a couple of beats in the air, and the famous old hymn burst out royally.
The great volume of sound seemed too fierce and urgent even for that spacious room.
It pressed against the eardrums almost with pain, though sung with the perfect time and tune which was the heritage of the sweet-voiced North country folk: "All people that on earth do dwell, Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice!"
As Basil Gortre listened, his heart expanded in love and fellowship towards these brother Christians.
The dark phantoms which had rioted in his sick brain during the long weeks of his illness lay dead and harmless now.
Constantine Schuabe was almost forgotten.
The monstrous visions of a conventional and formal Christianity, covering a world of secret and mocking atheism, seemed incredibly far removed from the glorious truth, as these strong, homely people sang a full voiced shout of welcome to the great Trinity of Power and Love, unseen, but all around them.
Basil smiled to himself.
Who was he to be refined and too sophisticated for God's use?
There seemed nothing incongruous now in the picture before his eyes.
The remnants of broken ham, the sloppy cups, the black-coated men with brilliant sky-blue satin ties, the women with thick gnarled hands and clothes the colour of a copper kettle: what were they now but his very own brethren, united in this burst of praise?
And he joined in the doxology with all his heart and voice, his voice soaring joyously above the rest: "To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, The God whom heaven and earth adore, From men and from the Angel host Be praise and glory evermore.
Amen."
It ceased with suddenness.
There was the satisfied silence of a second, and then the attendant helpers, assisted by the feasters, fell swiftly on the tables.
Cloths and crockery vanished like snow melting in sunlight.
As soon as each table was laid bare it was turned up by an ingenious arrangement underneath, and became a long bench with a back, which was added to the rows of seats facing the platform.
As each iron framed seat was pushed noisily into its place, it was filled at once with a laughing crowd, full but active, smacking anticipatory chops over the entertainment and speechmaking to come. Mr. Cuthbert, a painstaking pianist, whose repertoire was noisily commonplace, opened the concert with a solo.
Songs and recitations followed.
All were well received by an audience determined to enjoy itself, but it was obvious that the real event of the gathering was eagerly awaited.
At last the moment arrived.
A table covered with green baize and bearing some objects concealed by a cloth was carried onto the platform, and a row of chairs placed on either side of it.
The vicar, with Basil, and a little group of black-coated churchwardens and sidesmen filed onto the platform amid tumultuous cheering and clapping of hands.
After several lengthy speeches, Mr. Byars announced, "And now I will simply ask Mr. Gortre to accept this silver tea service, and watch, in the name of the congregation of St. Thomas as a token of their esteem and goodwill."
He pulled the cloth away and displayed some glittering silver vessels.
Then he handed the young man a gold watch in a leather case.
Basil faced the shouting, enthusiastic crowd, staring through dimmed eyes at the long rows of animated faces.
When there was a little silence he began to speak in a voice of great emotion.
Very simply and earnestly he thanked them for their goodwill and kindness.
"This may be," he said, "the last time I will ever have the privilege and pleasure of speaking to you.
I want to give you one last message before I take up my new post as curate in a large parish in Bloomsbury in London.
I want to urge one and all here tonight to do one thing."
He paused for a moment, to be sure he had the attention of everyone in the hall.
"Keep your faith unspotted, unstained by doubts, uninfluenced by fears.
Do that, and all will be well with you here and hereafter."
His voice sank a full tone and he spoke with marked emphasis.
"I have sometimes thought and felt of late that possibly the time may be at hand when the Powers and Principalities of evil will make a great and determined onslaught on the Christian Faith.
I may not read the signs of the times aright.
My premonitions -- for they have sometimes amounted even to that -- may be unfounded or imaginary.
But if such a time is coming, if the 'horror of great darkness,' a spiritual horror that we read of in Genesis, descends on the world and envelops it in its gloom and terror, let us have faith.
Keep the light burning steadily.
'Let nothing disturb thee; let nothing affright thee.
All passeth: God only remaineth.'
And now, dear brothers and sisters in the Holy Faith, thank you, God bless you, and farewell."
There was a tense silence as his voice dropped to a close.
Here and there a woman sobbed.
There was something uncharacteristic about his warning.
He spoke almost in prophecy, as if he knew of some terror coming, and saw its advance from afar.
His face, still pale and thin from fever, his bright, earnest eyes, not the glittering eyes of a fanatic, but the saner, wiser ones of the earnest single-minded man, had an immense influence with the people there.
And that night, as they trudged home to simple dwellings, or suburban villas, or rolled away in carriages, each person heard the intense, quiet voice warning them of the future, exhorting them to be steadfast in the Faith.
Chapter 7 Two weeks later, Helena Byars stood with her hand raised to her eyes, close by the port paddle box of the steamer, staring straight in front of her at a faint grey line on the horizon.
A stiff breeze was blowing in the English Channel, though the sun was shining brightly on the tossing waters.
By the tall, graceful figure of the girl, swaying with the motion of the paddle steamer and bending gracefully to the sudden onslaughts of the wind, stood a thickset man of middle height, dressed in a tweed suit.
His face was a strong one.
Heavy reddish eyebrows hung over a pair of clear grey eyes, intellectual and kindly.
This was Harold Spence, the journalist with whom Basil Gortre was to live after the holiday was over and he began his work in the parish church in Bloomsbury.
Spence was snatching a few days from his work in Fleet Street, in order to accompany Basil and Mr. and Miss Byars to Dieppe.
It had been his first introduction to the vicar and his daughter.
"So that is really France, Mr. Spence!"
said Helena.
"The very first view of a foreign country I have ever had.
I don't suppose you have any idea of what I'm feeling now?
It seems so wonderful; something I have been waiting for all my life."
Spence smiled kindly, irradiating his face with good humour as he did so.
"Well, my sensations or emotions at present, Miss Byars, are entirely confined to wondering whether I'm going to be seasick or not."
"Don't speak of it!"
said a thin voice, a voice from which all the blood seemed to be drained.
Turning, they saw the vicar at their elbow.
His face was white, his beard hung in lank dejection, a sincere misery poured from his wretched eyes.
"Basil," he said, "Basil is down in the saloon eating greasy cold chicken and ham and drinking pale ale.
I told him it was an outrage!"
His feelings overcame him and he staggered away towards the stern.
"Poor Father," said the girl.
"He never could stand the sea.
But he very soon gets all right when he's on dry land again.
Oh, look, that must be a church tower!
I can see it quite distinctly, and the sun glinting from the roofs of the houses."
"That's St. Jacques," said Spence, "and that dome some way to the right is St. Remy. Farthest of all to the right, on the cliffs, you can just see the chateau where the military garrison is."
Helena gazed eagerly and became silent in her excitement.
Basil, who came up from the saloon and joined them, watched her tenderly.
There was something childishly sweet in his fiancee's delight as the broad, tub-like paddle steamer kicked its way rapidly towards the quaint foreign town.
In smoky Walktown he had not often seen Helena like this.
Life was a more sober thing there, and her nature was graver than that of many girls.
But at the beginning of this holiday time, under a brilliant spring sun which she was already beginning to imagine had a foreign charm about it, she was in a holiday mood.
Basil pulled out his new and glorious gold watch, which had replaced the battered old gunmetal one he usually wore.
Though not a poor man, he was simple in all his tastes, and the new toy gave him a recurring pleasure whenever he looked at it.
"We ought to land in about twenty minutes," he said.
"Have you noticed that the tossing of the ship has almost stopped?
The land protects us.
I wonder if you'll remember any of your French, Helena.
I almost wish I was like you, seeing a foreign country for the first time.
Spence is the real voyageur though.
He's been all over the world for his newspaper."
The vicar came up to them again, just as there was a general movement of the passengers towards the deck.
A hooting cry from the steam whistle wailed over the water as the boat began to slow.
In a few minutes they had passed the breakwater and were gliding slowly past the wharves towards the landing stage.
Suddenly Helena clutched hold of Basil's arm.
"Oh, Basil," she whispered, "how beautiful -- look!
Guarding the harbour!"
He turned and followed the direction of her glance.
An enormous crucifix, more than life-size, planted in the ground, rose from the low cliffs on the right for all entering the harbour to see.
They watched the symbol in silence as the passengers chattered on every side and gathered up their rugs and hand luggage.
Basil Gortre slipped his arm through Helena's.
The reminder was so vivid and sudden it affected them powerfully.
They were both people living in the world and enjoying the pleasures of life that came their way.
But his faith, like Helena's, was always and for ever with him a transmuting force which changed his life each hour in a way of which the nominal believer has no conception.
A letter he had once written to Helena during a holiday compressed all his belief, and his joy in his belief, into a few short lines.
Thus had run the sincere and simple statement, unadorned by any effort of literary grace to give it point and force:
Day by day as your letters come, I go on saying my prayers for you, and with you, in fresh faith and confidence.
You know that I absolutely trust the Lord Jesus Christ, who is, I believe, the God who made the worlds, and I pray to Him continually, relying on His promises.
I keep on reading all sides of the question, as your father does also, and while admitting all that honest criticism and sincere intellectual doubt can teach me, I grow more and more convinced that the Gospels and Paul's letters relate facts and not imaginations or hallucinations.
And the more strongly my intellect is convinced, so much more does my heart delight in the love of God, who has given Himself for me.
How magnificent is that finale of St. John's Gospel!
'Thomas saith unto Him, My Lord and my God.'
And, then, how exquisite is the supplement about the bodily appearance of Jesus by the lake shore after His resurrection.
I see Mrs. Humphry Ward says it was a dream which the old man at Ephesus related, and his disciples thought it was fact.
And she is a literary person!
So, as the engaged couple glided slowly past the high symbol of God's pain, the worship in their hearts found but little utterance on their lips, though they were deeply touched.
It seemed a good omen to welcome them to France.
Spence remained to look after the luggage and see it through the Customs, and the three others resolved to walk to the rooms they had taken in the Faubourg de la Barre on the steep hill behind the chateau.
They passed over the railway line in the middle of the road, past the cafes clustered round the landing stage, and into the quaint marketplace with the great Gothic Cathedral Church of St. Jacques on one side, and the colossal statue of Duquesne surrounded by baskets of spring flowers in the centre.
To Helena Byars, that simple progress was one of unalloyed excitement and delight.
The small and wiry soldiers in their unfamiliar uniforms; an officer sipping vermouth in a cafe, with spurs, sword, and helmet shining in the sun; two black priests, with huge furry hats -- all the moving colour of the scene gave her new and delightful sensations.
"It is all so different!"
she said breathlessly.
"So bright and cheerful.
Look at that red thing over the tobacco shop, and that little brass dish over the hairdresser's.
Think of Walktown or Salford, now!"
The house in the Faubourg de la Barre was kept by Madame Varnier, who spoke English well, and was in the habit of letting her rooms to English people.
A late dejeuner was ready for them.
The omelette was a revelation to Helena, and the rognons sautes filled her with respect for such cooking, but she was impatient, nevertheless, to be out sightseeing.
The vicar was tired, and proposed to stay indoors with the Spectator, and Harold Spence had some letters to write, so Basil and Helena went out alone.
They turned down a narrow street of quiet houses, and came out onto la Plage.
There were a good many people walking up and down the great promenade from the Casino to the harbour mouth.
An air of fullness and prosperity floated round the magnificent hotels which faced the sea.
They began a steady walk towards the pier and lighthouse.
The wind was fresh, though not troublesome, and at five o'clock the sun, low in the sky, was still bright.
Helena Byars held her own among the cosmopolitan crowd of women who walked on la Plage.
Her beauty was Saxon, very English, and not of a type always appreciated to its full value on the Continent, but it shone the more from Latin contrasts, and could not escape remark.
Every now and again they turned, at distances of a quarter of a mile or so, and during the recurrence of their beat they began to notice a man they passed several times, coming and going.
He was an enormous man, broad and tall, dressed expensively and with care.
His size alone was sufficient to mark him out of the usual, but his personality seemed to them no less arresting and strange.
His large, smooth face was fat, the eyes small and brilliant, with heavy pouches under them.
Basil said he seemed to belong to the Prince Regent's period.
"I can imagine him on the lawns at Brighton or dining in the Pavilion," he said.
"What a sensual, evil face the man has!
Of course it may mean nothing, though.
A Bishop I know, whose work on the Gospels is the most wonderful thing ever done in the way of Christian apologetics, has a face like one of the grotesque devils carved on the roof of Notre Dame or Lincoln Cathedral.
