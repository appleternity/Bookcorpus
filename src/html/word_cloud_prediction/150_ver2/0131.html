The Organization has authority over when Services are provided to whom.  The Booker usually has to communicate and negotiate with the Organization to plan the Services for a mutually agreeable Scheduled_time.  Usually, there is a Payment as well.  'We can book you a boatride on the Somme or a special tour of the Louvre .' 'Now booking trips to Cancunfor only $50 !

'' When the Booker is also the Organization providing the service, as in the first sentence below, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Organization on the second.  Realizing that the Booker is also the Organization providing the service is an inference, as we can see by comparing the following two examples.  In the first, it seems clear that the hotel is providing the service.  In the second, it is clear that the hotel is not providing the service.  'The hotel gave us a reservation for two nights .' 'The hotel gave us a reservation for two nights at the adjacent hotel to make up for screwing up our original booking .'  '' In the frequent case where the Booker is the same as the Client, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Client on the second.  Client is on the second layer since, in most cases, it is an inference that may be wrong.  For example, in the following sentence, the annotation indicates that Patrick is the Client.  However, it is also possible that Patrick is reserving a table for a party that doesn't even include himself:  'Patrick tried to reserve a table at Dorsia  for 7:00 .'

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.  '' 'Abashed, realising that he had overheard her conversation with Victoria, Sheeley didn't try to make excuses.'  'She smelled the wine on Paul's breath, and bade him to sit down.'"}, {'frame': 'Make_noise', 'tfidf': 0.5499557679675147, 'lexical_unit': 'plash.v / giggle.v / growl.v', 'definition': "A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.  This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Thriving', 'tfidf': 0.5494128642495649, 'lexical_unit': 'live.v / prosper.v / prosperity.n', 'definition': "An Entity is in a state such that it participates in a preponderance of states and events which are desirable for it.

It made me nervous so I tried saying something flippant.
"You're giving me a dead flower?
You've really never had to work at this, have you?"
"For the record, this flower isn't dead.
It's a very rare bloom called the Black Cherry Blossom.
Women are all about tokens and symbols when they begin falling in love with someone.
Isn't giving a rare flower to the woman I'm courting a kind of symbol of how rare our love might be also?"
His mocking tone made this situation laughable.
I couldn't understand where his motivation was coming from or what he was really feeling in regards to us being an actual item.
It honestly felt like he was just trying to be cruel.
"Do you see me swooning?"
I folded my arms over my chest defensively and tapped my foot.
"Nothing says romance like a burnt flower.
What's so special about this?"
"Take it and examine it.
You might be surprised at its deceptive beauty."
I looked at the flower again, and wondered if I should really accept his lame token of affection or even continue what I knew was just a way for Tie to get back at Victor.
Tie's eyes flashed one confusing emotion after another, and even though he was the one offering me such a rare and special flower I got the distinct impression that he was silently pleading for me to refuse it.
Taking that flower would be giving him a leg up on this weird little challenge we'd struck with one another.
If I wanted to prove I was immune to his charms I needed to be the one setting the conditions, and I needed to make sure they were the kind of conditions that would ensure me a win.
Before he had time to anticipate me, I batted the blossom away with the back of my hand and got right in his face.
He looked to the floor where the flower had landed and then watched as it disappeared.
I could have sworn I heard him let out a sigh of relief.
"You seem to think one kiss from Victor was all it took to get me to fall for him," I said pointing my finger in his chest.
"Do you deny you were into it?"
"All I'm saying is this: If you really want to prove something here, don't hand me a withered old flower and expect me to beg for an engagement ring.
Put your money where your mouth is and kiss me."
Daring Tie to kiss me wasn't necessarily the brightest idea I'd ever had nor was it my normal MO. Nope.
This move had Angie written all over it.
However, I knew Tie was only interested in making passes at me if Victor was present.
There was no way he was going to actually attempt something as physical as this if his intended audience was nowhere in sight.
And so I dared him to kiss me. Yep.
So many unbelievable and bizarre things had happened to me tonight, I think I figured this was simply par for the course.
Taking in Tie's expression made me think my impulsive challenge had actually been a good one.
He had not been expecting this.
His calm facade had slipped, and he actually looked nervous.
I decided to press my advantage and enjoy it as much as possible.
"Uh oh.
Are we out of practice, Tie?
So busy finding love for other people we don't remember how to do it for ourselves?"
I teased ruthlessly.
"Better luck next time."
I turned around and headed for my bed wearing my own smug little smile.
I'd been right all along.
He wouldn't touch me without his oldest enemy present.
Before I'd taken two steps, I felt his arms surround me possessively.
I might have attempted to struggle, but I was too stunned by the sensation of his warm, moist lips slowly kissing the tender side of my neck.
I should have put up some kind of resistance, but my body was not cooperating with me.
What was happening?
This hadn't been the plan at all!
Instead of pushing away from him, I couldn't help but tilt my head to the side as he continued his slow assault down the length of my neck toward my shoulder.
He grabbed my waist and turned me roughly to face him.
His eyes were stormy with a need I couldn't even begin to understand.
He cupped the sides of my face in his hands and crushed my lips to his.
A soft moan escaped my mouth.
My reaction to him was explosive.
I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and held him as tightly as he was holding me.
His kisses were aggressive and demanding, filling up every lonely space I hadn't known existed.
It was all so familiar and peaceful and turbulent and crazy.
I could actually feel something powerful happening between us--something building that hadn't been there with Victor.
Then an amazing thing happened.
Our life forces connected to one another, and my mind was seeing beautiful warm tones of yellow, gold and orange.
They invited me in, beckoning me to stay, to never part from them again.
I searched his heart, looking for the old ache that had been there previously, but I couldn't find it anywhere.
It seemed to have vanished along with any trace of the pain he'd been holding onto.
Instead, what I could feel him holding onto was me.
Tie's spirit held me close and claimed me for his own.
I didn't put up a fight.
I didn't want to fight it anymore.
I just wanted to stay warm and loved and happy.
As I accepted this connection with all of my heart he broke away from me abruptly, severing the joining of our spirits in the process.
It was surprisingly painful.
Neither one of us spoke for several seconds.
I think we were both surprised by what those kisses had revealed.
Tie looked like someone had taken his whole world and turned it upside down.
He began pacing the room back and forth.
He would stop to look at me for one brief second, and in that second I would see fear, disbelief, worry, and even love pouring out of his piercing blue eyes.
He finally stopped in front of me and grabbed my shoulders hard.
"That wasn't supposed to happen.
It isn't possible.
It can't be possible.
It goes against everything I've ever been told."
"Tie, what are you talking about?
What's so impossible about the idea of us kissing?"
He gave me a frightened look and shook me as he spoke.
"Tell me..."
he stopped talking.
He looked like he was swallowing back a slew of unfamiliar emotions.
"Tell me I'm not the only one who felt that, Hope.
Tell me I'm not the only one who saw that."
He was sounding more and more desperate.
I'd known for some time that I had feelings for Tie, but I wasn't expecting his kisses to reveal to me how strong they were.
It was like everything had been magnified and now there really was no way to deny exactly how I felt about him.
"Do you mean the connection we made?
The colors we created together?"
He let go of me, running his hands through his hair.
"Amazing.
You did feel it.
It wasn't just me.
This is real.
This is really happening."
He looked like he didn't know whether to be ecstatic or completely freaked out.
"Of course, I felt it.
I've never experienced anything like it."
I stepped toward him, afraid he was trying to put distance between us.
I didn't want him to distance himself from me ever again, but he held up his hands warding me off.
"You never felt this with Victor?"
He looked like he was afraid to hear the answer.
"I saw you two kissing outside earlier."
He had a hard time looking at me when he said that.
"Your life force didn't connect with his?"
"Absolutely not.
You're the only person I've ever connected to like that.
The colors were just as amazing and wonderful as they were the first time I connected to you."
Tie lowered his hands looking dumbfounded.
"This has happened before?"
"Two times before, actually.
Once at the nurse's station, and a second time when I was healing you from that stab wound."
Tie crossed over to me in one long stride and wrapped his arms around me.
"That can't be true.
I didn't notice it before.
Why didn't I see it?"
"Maybe you weren't ready to."
"What?"
"Tie, your heart was pretty damaged even before that sword did a number on it."
"What do you mean it was damaged?"
"There was an injury there.
Something dark and hateful you were still holding onto.
It was preventing me from healing you completely.
I think when we kissed our life forces were able to correct it together.
It isn't there anymore."
He put his hand to his heart and held perfectly still.
"You're right.
It isn't there anymore, and it was supposed to be permanent.
Everything's changing so fast, and I have no idea what to do about it."
I watched Tie.
He held his hand to his heart and looked at me, but his mind was elsewhere.
"Why is this so significant, and why was your heart supposed to be damaged permanently?
I'm so sick of having absolutely no idea what you're talking about."
I put my hands on my hips and tapped my foot in frustration.
"So help me, Tie, you are going to answer my questions, and you are going to answer them now because if you don't I'll do something absolutely deplorable."
My words broke Tie from his chaotic musings long enough for him to take in my seriously pissed stance.
Then he smiled.
I'd never seen him smile so big.
He wrapped his arms around me again and rested his chin on my forehead.
"You're incapable of deplorable acts."
"I swear I'll sic Angie on you."
His laughter made my heart feel lighter than ever.
"Connecting to someone like that hardly ever happens because most people don't use their life force the way we do.
That's why I have the job that I have.
