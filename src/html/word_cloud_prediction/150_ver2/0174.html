NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "}, {'frame': 'Remainder', 'tfidf': 2.6088881532379324, 'lexical_unit': 'remnant.n / remain.v / left.a', 'definition': "A Resource is depleted by some process, resulting in there being only a Remainder in existence some time into or after the process.

"I want you to promise me that you'll never ask me what happened aboard that ship.
I know it's asking a lot of you, but I can't speak about it.
I need to erase it all from my mind."
"Other people will ask questions, too," Victor reminded her.
"They're going to want answers from you and me.
What am I going to say to them?"
"Tell them you can't remember," Hailey suggested.
"I'm already trying to forget."
"I can understand you not wanting to tell others," said Victor, "but I'm a part of this as much as you are.
Ryan was my best friend.
Why won't you tell me what happened?"
"It's best you don't know," said Hailey shuddering.
"No one can ever know.
You need to promise me that you'll never ask me about this again."
"I don't know--" "Just promise me, Victor."
Victor felt pressured by the urgency of Hailey's request, because he had not even started to process the psychological damage done to all those involved.
He decided to approach the matter as diplomatically as he handled everything else in his life.
"I can't promise you that I'll never ask you about it again, Hailey.
But I promise not to ask you again tonight."
"Fair enough," Hailey sighed, while tilting her head against the car's passenger window, permitting the full Moon to cast a pale glow upon her features.
"What do you want to do now?"
Victor asked her tentatively.
"Just drive."
"Drive where?"
"I don't care," she murmured breathlessly.
"Somewhere quiet...somewhere safe--just don't stop driving until you see the Sun."
With those instructions, Victor turned his attention back to the road.
A clock on the Mustang's dashboard radio blinked 12:00 A.M., but he knew it was much later.
The scenery aligning Route 51 eventually transformed into a stretch of darkened pastures and abandoned farmyards.
Beyond and above these rural regions, hundreds of stars sparkled like polished diamonds across the horizon.
In the heaven's foreground, the Moon contributed its silvery beams to the fields.
Victor peered deeply into the celestial world, believing that it never appeared brighter or more significant to his eyes.
In these moments, his thoughts naturally returned to his friend, and he clung--perhaps somewhat naively--to a belief that Ryan was somehow still alive and soaring among the jewels of the nighttime sky.
Before becoming too absorbed by his reflections, Victor's attention drifted back to his passenger.
Hailey had closed her eyes at last.
She slept with her hands enlaced across her belly.
Moonlight spilled upon her delicate features, giving her skin a pewter-like sheen in the moving vehicle's shadows.
Victor stared at her lovingly, and for perhaps the first time in his lifetime he felt empowered by the present circumstances.
Though it was hardly a moment for celebration, for at least a few fleeting seconds Victor finally sensed a degree of control in his life.
He was not the messenger anymore, and the promise of what awaited him in the future remained concealed in the unfathomable provinces of space.
CHAPTER 23
In the months following the Occurrence on Route 51, as investigators now coined it, Gary Wescott's prediction of an onslaught of media exposure proved to be as prophetic as anything he ever uttered.
Reporters and agency officials congregated in a never-ending stampede upon Glen Dale's pine groves.
Some sought to survey the existing crater firsthand, while others hunted for similar areas within the region that promised more than just the aftermath of an unknown phenomenon.
Ultimately, neither scientists nor authorities provided any definitive theory on the precise nature of events.
Despite hundreds of confessions from the locals, who surfaced from the underground more explosively than the UFO itself, the powers-that-be filed inconclusive reports.
Conspiracy theories abounded, most of them signifying that the government orchestrated yet another cover-up to prevent mass hysteria from overtaking the country.
This sort of hype only heightened the intrigue surrounding Glen Dale's grandest attraction.
In the first six months, a day had not gone by without multiple groups converging upon the clearing, which was now officially designated as a hazardous zone.
Even with this warning in place, people still camped along the fringes of Route 51, hoping to catch a glimpse of something to exhilarate their lackluster lives.
A host of organizations insisted that whatever erupted from the soil had definite intentions of returning to the scene.
But their conclusions had thus far disappointed all those who listened--and waited.
Perhaps Wescott loathed the rejuvenation in his town's popularity more than anyone.
Whenever a television camera or microphone was set in front of his face he viciously chastised the media for disrupting the quietude of his provincial town.
Of course it soon became a hypocritical endeavor for the former chief.
Though Wescott professed to loathe such publicity, he ironically frittered away most of his hours fielding questions and juggling as many interviews as his schedule permitted.
Inevitably, Wescott's recollections of past years became the focal point of his discourse.
It was only a matter of time before he revealed his connection to Ryan Hayden and his family.
Naturally, curiosity guided investigators to Belle Falls in pursuit of the one person who might have been able to shed a sliver of light on the controversy at hand.
After locating Ryan's grandfather, however, they learned about the boy's own disappearance.
Frank refused to speak a word about what he thought happened to Ryan, and he was not rushing out to assemble any search parties either.
Frank's prolonged silence spawned further speculation, but the old man found all the closure he needed at the wide end of his gin bottle.
Out of all of those who came to gawk at the occurrence, the only two individuals who could have handily squelched the rumors were not anywhere to be found.
Victor and Hailey both elected to avoid the frenzied media for as long as possible.
Victor figured that Hailey would have eventually recovered from her ordeal and disclosed all that she knew.
It did not happen.
After months of waiting, Victor concluded that she had no intention of mentioning her relationship with Ryan Hayden or her encounter aboard the alien spacecraft.
The passing months also brought another fact into focus in regard to Hailey's condition.
Concealing her pregnancy could not be achieved by wearing baggy shirts and sweatpants any longer.
Consequently, the hallways of Belle Falls High School soon echoed with gossip on the father's identity.
Neil Chandler was immediately thought to be responsible, and Hailey had purposely slept with the boy numerous times over several months to secure such a notion in his mind.
He was either too obtuse or indifferent to attempt the math that disqualified him as a potential parent.
She, of course, realized that the child within her womb belonged to Ryan Hayden.
But she did not confess this fact to her family or closest friends, and vowed to maintain her silence for as long as her unborn child's safety remained in jeopardy.
As Hailey neared her pregnancy's final stages, Victor was perhaps the sole person in Belle Falls who suspected that Neil's paternity was uncertain.
Victor had originally planned to become closer to Hailey over the last nine months, but she retreated from all forms of socializing and ultimately decided to leave school for the remainder of the year.
Before Hailey departed, she spoke to Victor personally on a few occasions, and maybe fielded a sporadic phone call or two, but she refrained from mentioning what was most essential to Victor.
Hailey's only thoughts on the matter reiterated what she had affirmed to him on the night in question: she wanted to block the incident from her mind permanently.
Perhaps Victor had already undergone his own degree of shock pertaining to Ryan's passing.
Since a body was yet to be discovered, he had not even fully accepted his best friend's death.
During Victor's lonelier moments, which increased in frequency each day, he awakened from sleep saturated in a chilled sweat.
His attention immediately shifted to the stars, where he sought out the boldest one hanging in the horizon.
At least in these moments Victor reminisced about the happier times he spent alongside his friend and his telescope.
Within the boundless region of the vast unknown, Victor sensed a security that could not be duplicated within this planet's atmosphere.
Even now, after enduring the loss of his only true friend, Victor felt entranced by the heavens.
He was tempted to believe that Ryan still watched him from a region unknown to Earth.
Victor was content to never utter another syllable in reference to the Occurrence on Route 51.
But an unexpected visitation from an elderly man, whom he never met before, changed everything.
This slightly eccentric man, who neglected to identify himself, prompted the boy to engage Hailey in conversation after she gave birth to her child.
Victor debated the information revealed to him for three weeks--right up until Hailey's anticipated date of delivery.
He assumed Hailey would have been escorted to the nearest hospital upon going into labor.
Since everyone in Belle Falls had somehow finagled their neighbors to spout forth information, arriving at Belle Fall's Medical Center on the day Hailey gave birth proved to be less taxing than he originally surmised.
The medical facility in Belle Falls handled most of the routine procedures for the residents.
An influx of babies being delivered in the area over the past few years prompted construction of a new maternity ward on the structure's third floor.
As it was with most modern additions, the ward keepers here attracted mothers-to-be by marketing the environment less like a hospital and more akin to a hotel suite.
Hailey's family had been excruciatingly cautious throughout their daughter's pregnancy.
At one point, they almost demanded that she abort it in order to preserve her own reputation, but they were really more concerned about the repercussions on themselves.
Since Hailey refused to harm her unborn fetus, they suggested adoption as a second option, but she rejected that notion as well.
"Nobody is going to take my baby away from me," she said on numerous occasions.
And here in Belle Falls, within the safe quarters of a homespun hospital, no one challenged her decision any longer.
On a late September morning, while surrounded by her suddenly supportive family, Hailey gave birth to a healthy eight-pound boy.
The presumed father was nowhere to be found.
Neil had apparently figured out that his obsessive steroid usage probably excluded him from him fathering any children in his lifetime.
But Hailey never shed a teardrop over what her family assessed as a devastating consequence.
"I don't need Neil or any other man to help me with my baby," said Hailey, shortly after cradling her infant son for the first time.
If anyone sought to argue her pledge, they withheld their comments for now.
In respect to Hailey's wishes, her family soon left her alone so that she had an opportunity to bond privately with her new baby.
Victor had taken the necessary steps to sneak into the maternity ward undetected.
After disguising himself as an orderly, he ambled directly between two security guards and a police officer standing in the main lobby.
The officer was in fact a Lieutenant for the township for many years.
Lieutenant Braxton was a long-time resident and highly respected by the locals.
He was a swarthy-skinned man who was rumored to have a nose keener than a bloodhound when it came to sniffing out trouble, but he did not expect any danger when looking at Victor's congenial face.
Besides, Braxton's business at the hospital was of a personal nature today.
His own daughter-in-law had just given birth to twin girls.
Braxton busied himself by handing out cigars to random folks in the lobby--a token gesture that was truly as passe as the lieutenant's off-duty wardrobe.
Once Victor was buzzed into the maternity ward, he used a mop to sweep his way to a doorway at the end of the corridor--precisely where Hailey Gardner tended to her newborn.
Upon noticing Victor in the doorway, Hailey was immediately startled.
She glanced over his blue and white uniform tentatively before saying, "Victor--what are you doing here?"
Victor had lost almost ten pounds from his already emaciated frame since the last time Hailey had seen him nearly six months ago.
He leaned heavily upon the mop's handle, while watching Hailey shift uncomfortably in the bed with the infant nestled against her chest.
Following a few seconds of silence, Victor answered her sprightly.
"What does it look like I'm doing?"
he then held out his mop for her inspection.
"My guidance counselor always told me I was destined to clean up--apparently, now is my big chance."
"You work here?"
"Yeah--just part-time.
I figured I could save up some money for a new car--not brand new or anything like that, but something nicer than my dad's old Buick."
"Why aren't you at college?
Didn't you tell me you were going away?"
"Change of plans," said Victor.
"Scholarship issues, but I didn't come here to talk about that boring stuff."
Hailey smiled politely, but her facial expression indicated that she was a tad unnerved by his presence.
Victor did not wait for an invitation into the room.
He pushed his way in with the broom extended in front of his footsteps.
"I can see that you'll have your hands full from now on," he said, gesturing to the baby.
"Wow--I think it's really cool that you're a mom.
I guess we really are getting older, huh?"
"I guess," Hailey spoke softly, still appearing somewhat awkward with her unwanted company.
"Hey," said Victor, "I hope I'm not here at a bad time or anything--" "Actually, I was just trying to get the baby to go to sleep," Hailey offered.
"Maybe you can come back later--how does that sound?"
She still attempted to be cordial, but the tension in her furrowed brow was obvious from across the room.
"Um...I'd really like to, Hailey, but I only have a few minutes before my boss will start to miss me.
I promise I won't take up much of your time--or your baby's either."
As Victor edged closer to the bed, Hailey found herself instinctually swaddling her baby tighter in her arms.
She watched Victor's actions carefully as he set his mop beside the bed and hunched down into a recliner next to her.
From where he was situated he saw the baby's tender pink face and slate-blue eyes.
The infant cried a bit, but nothing out of the ordinary.
The baby's powder-blue cap, which covered a portion of the baby's dark hair, permitted Victor to indulge in obligatory small talk.
"It looks like a boy," he announced joyfully, "and a cute one, too."
"Thanks," said Hailey, easing the rigidity in her posture slightly.
