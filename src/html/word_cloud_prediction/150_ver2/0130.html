In some cases, the Source location from which the Goods were taken is used to metonymically refer to the Victim.  The robbery can be done in a particular Manner (for example, forcefully) and via a specific Means (for example, by threatening the Victim).  'Half of the team held up the tellers while the others were stationed to report the arrival of police.'

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

Is he an old Army pal?"
Georgie asked while looking up at The Old Man rubbing his dog tags.
"Georgie my boy, that is an expression," The Old Man said.
"Expression?"
Georgie asked.
"Yes, an expression is what we use in English to add to a sentence.
Your dad said, 'Let me get you a trash can just in case,' and what he meant was in case you get sick," The Old Man said with a slight smile.
"Oh, how funny!"
Georgie exclaimed and slammed his foot on the ground a few times.
"Sh...sh... keep your voice down.
People are sleeping.
Now, go to bed," The Old Man said as he hugged Georgie.
"Yes, grandpa," Georgie replied.
"Goodnight," The Old Gray said.
Georgie walked back to his bedroom while The Old Man walked downstairs.
Lee had the fireplace lit and roaring and was watching the flames.
The firelight flickered against The Old Man's body and cast a large silhouette on the upstairs hallway.
He walked to the kitchen and turned out the lights.
He opened the drawer on the china cabinet and removed a notepad.
He grabbed a ballpoint pen and sat down in his chair next to the fireplace.
Cali got up from the bear rug on which she lay and rested her head on The Old Man's lap.
He gently scruffed her chin and she kissed his calloused hands.
She removed her head from his lap and rested her body on his feet.
He opened the flue several times with the handle that extended from the wall and the fire roared as more oxygen was let in.
The Old Man glanced over towards Lee.
Lee was asleep with his legs stretched out and arms folded across his chest.
He snored loudly and spoke in his sleep, "No, mom..."
"Don't leave... mom," Lee grumbled.
The Old Man opened up the tattered notebook and began writing his letter to Lee.
Chapter 18: The Disappearance Lee awoke from the chair.
In his lap rested a manila envelope addressed to him.
He stood up and walked upstairs to check on the children.
They were still asleep and there was vomit alongside the edge of the bed and across the wastebasket.
Lee closed the door and went to use the bathroom.
He took a shower and brushed his teeth, then he combed his hair back to spike it up.
He shaved and slathered on his favorite Brute aftershave.
He cleaned up the mirrors and the wash basin and then proceeded downstairs.
As he was walking downstairs he heard the distant barking of a dog which came in through the screen door.
Lee walked into the kitchen and noticed that the burner for the coffee was still on.
He shut it off and poured a mug full.
Next to the coffee was a note.
Lee,											6:00 AM I will be home within the hour.
Cali and I are scouting for deer.
I brought my gear pack and rifle with ammo in case I have to stay overnight.
I also have a pup tent and two jackets, because the Signawunder Gazette said that there might be a snowstorm tonight.
If it gets really bad I will be home within 24 hours... if not, then call a coroner.
Love, Dad
Lee posted the note to the refrigerator with a magnet.
He put a time stamp of when he read it.
It was 6:33 AM.
He opened the cupboard and took out the frying pan and non-stick cooking spray.
He took the eggs and milk from the fridge and grabbed the Hershey's chocolate sauce.
He fried six eggs over easy and poured five glasses of chocolate milk that he made from the chocolate sauce.
Georgie, Lonny, and Johannasse walked down the stairs.
"You boys ready for breakfast?"
Lee said with a smile.
"Yes!"
They cried out.
"Have a seat and it will be right up.
You got up at the perfect time," Lee said with a wink.
He finished cooking the eggs and set the plate in the center of the table.
He gave each of his sons a glass of chocolate milk and he set his two glasses at the end of the table.
They said grace and ate the food.
"Can we be excused after we eat to go outside?"
Lonny asked.
"Yes, but make sure you are in sight of the cabin at all times.
Wear your jackets and come inside if it gets too cold for you.
Understand?"
Lee warned with a glare of intimidation.
"Okay, dad," Lonny replied.
The boys finished up their meals and ran upstairs to get their jackets while Lee got up and stoked the fire.
He turned on the radio and played the classical music station softly.
The children came downstairs and went outside.
As they went out of the screen door the music on the radio was interrupted.
"We interrupt this broadcast to provide a warning.
At 6:00 AM there was a large storm cell spotted heading towards Signawunder.
All citizens are warned to stay indoors and make a fire to stay warm.
This storm cell is capable of large amounts of snowfall and blowing winds up to 50 mile per hour.
Any and all errands must be done within the next hour.
Thank you."
Lee walked back to the refrigerator and grabbed a grape soda.
He peered out of the kitchen window and shuddered as he observed his sons playing Civil War with sticks and cardboard.
I hope dad is on his way back home now.
It looks bad outside.
Lee walked back to the fireplace and opened the envelope.
He removed the letter and began to read it.
Lee,									November 20, 1960
It is with a sullen heart that I write these words down.
For 33 years I have kept hidden the truth of why my marriage with your mother failed.
First off, I was the culprit... the foul-mouthed, disrespectful drunkard that ended what could have been a lifetime of joy and love together.
The blocks that I pulled from the cabinet symbolize the destruction of my life and your respect for me as your dad.
These are stumbling blocks.
If you will recall the first instance in which you heard me lash out at your mother that is where it all started.
I arrived home from training the troops and had just walked in the door.
As soon as I set my keys down on the table I heard a crash upstairs.
You started to scream and I ran up the stairs.
I panicked, because your door was locked so I busted through it.
You were passed out and there was blood all over the furniture and the floor.
Your ankle was broken and when your mom walked upstairs after arriving home from work, she screamed in horror at what she saw.
'Why did you break the door in?'
I was flustered that you were injured and I picked you up and carried you to the car.
Your mom still was upset about the door and she couldn't frickin' get over it.
I grabbed a towel from the backseat of my car and wrapped your ankle to stop the bleeding.
I told your mom, 'If that is all you are going to harp on, then stay at home with the dogs!'
She cried and ran into the house screaming and shouting.
When I got you situated in the hospital, I called your mom.
She said,  'I am going to Lucy's for the weekend.'
That night I came home and put you to bed and I pulled out the Jack Daniel's and drank the rest of the bottle which was  3/4  full.
That was the start of my alcoholism.
Your mom arrived home on Monday night of the following week and she saw the bottle in the trash and questioned me.
I told her that if she really cared about me then she would shut up and show respect.
A year later she said that she had met a man while I was in France and she was divorcing me.
It has been a long and arduous road through Hell and back, but by the grace of God I am here today.
I have found that the blocks represent the cycle of life.
'A' and 'Z' represent A-Z and the 'G' block represents God.
You see, when you have to go from point 'A' which is being born into this world, and you travel through time all the way to point 'Z' which is old age, then God, 'G', is the only driving force.
I have felt like shooting myself after getting drunk one last time or just ramming my truck head-on into a tree outside of my cabin when I am on the way to Macy's Diner on Sunday's, because all I think about is the war and my sin... what I did, who I killed, and Mikhail and Cesslo's lives which were lost when it should've been me.
Anyways, I love you, pal.
I am glad that I am finally able to get this off of my chest.
God's blessings and grace to you while you travel from A-Z. -Dad
Lee set the letter aside and walked back to the kitchen window.
He looked outside and the snow started to fall gently.
The ground turned from green to white as he stared blankly into the foggy distance.
The birds were quiet and the children's laughter was muted and dull.
His head started to throb and his heart raced inside of his chest.
He walked to the screen door and yelled, "Kids, time to come inside.
The weather is getting bad!"
5:50 PM "Ah man, it's freezing, huh girl?"
The Old Man asked Cali.
Her tail swept the snow off of her back as she treaded through the thick ground.
"I think we will go a little further and turn back, but we might have to set up camp," he said.
Cali barked at a passing deer.
It leapt over a shrub and some fallen trees and tore into the distance.
"They sure are prominent this year, huh?"
The Old Man asked.
The Old Man and Cali continued for another half an hour.
The Old Man set up camp.
He pitched the tent and rolled out his sleeping bag.
He set a fire at the base of a wooded incline and cooked a ground squirrel that he shot.
The squirrel roasted on the flames and the smell was striking.
"Smells delicious!"
Cali looked at him earnestly as he pulled the squirrel off of the stick.
She barked at him.
"Hey, you be nice!
Ask properly and you will be rewarded."
Cali laid down and whimpered softly.
"C'mere."
She got up and laid across his lap.
He pulled off half of the meat and fed it to Cali while he ate the other half.
"Praise the Lord, oh my soul."
