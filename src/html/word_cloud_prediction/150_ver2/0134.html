'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.'

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Emmerich picked the head up by the hair.
The mohican spikes of hair dripped blood as he stepped up to the podium.
The men were terrified, some had wet their pants.
Emmerich grinned, he could see the wet spots on the men's trousers.
He had this group exactly where he wanted them, everything was going to plan.
He placed the head on the podium.
Emmerich said with authority: "You have seen my strength, you know my power!!
Now who will challenge me?"
No one nominated himself to challenge Emmerich.
"Good, wise decision, men.
Your leader was weak, I will bring you all to greatness!
I will give you all power that you've never known!!
I will personally see to it that none of you will be dominated ever again by anyone!!"
Emmerich tried to smile warmly at the members of the group and hoped it looked like a sincere, caring smile.
"This is a new stage in all of your lives, now you will all have a bright future."
Some of the men looked uncertainly at Emmerich but others began to smile.
"I am your leader now....... for all of you.
Sieg Heil!!
Sieg Heil!"
The men responded "Sieg Heil!
Sig Heil!"
with gusto.
They were afraid of this man but he did seem to offer victory for the members, not just talk.
Emmerich's takeover of the largest neo-Nazi group in Europe had been swift and effective.
In less than an hour, he had defeated the leader and cemented the loyalty of his members.
This was the first step in Emmerich's plan.
He would use the neo-Nazi groups he had control over to get a foothold in politics - he now had some power to progress his strategy.
Chapter 9
Armand walked out of the park, down to the turn of the road near the airport bus stop.
He opened up the black briefcase, took out the small bottle and dumped the briefcase into the bin.
He put the container of the lethal virus deep into his pocket - holding onto it firmly in case he dropped it.
Armand felt as if someone was standing beside him.
He turned but nobody was there.
He told himself not to get paranoid.
He jumped onto the airport bus.
His heart began to thump rapidly and he felt a kind of exhilaration...... increasing every second as the bus sped towards Charles De Gaulle airport.
Armand saw planes taking off majestically into the sky.
And as he watched, a plane landed, bumping on down the tarmacadam.
The sun shone and glinted off the parked aeroplanes.
Other planes sped down the runway, defying gravity and launching into the clouds.
He thought how nice it would be to be a passenger on a plane and to go on holiday somewhere far away from here.
He would never be able to afford it - his employer didn't pay him well.
He didn't have any friends, anyway, to go with.
He felt infuriated with people.
People seemed to loathe him and he detested them in return.
As the bus drove close to the airport, Armand thought of his only friend that he ever had in the whole world.
He died of a vicious cancer - he could still see him, lying in the bed.
It was as if his skin was draped over his bones, his friend had lost so much weight.
He remembered his friend's eye falling away from the socket.
God had let that happen.
God had caused him deep misery, he let his only friend die in such a horrible way.
Was there a God?
Yes - but as far as Armand was concerned - a cruel, manipulative one.
Now he would make others suffer as he had, and from then on.
Emmerich was different.
He would do anything for Emmerich.
He knew he didn't understand what love was as he had never experienced it...... but he felt he loved Emmerich.
Armand had to read the signs to follow where the departure area was.
He made his way as directed, towards the area.
He turned the small glass bottle containing the virus around repeatedly in his pocket with his hand.
It felt like there was nothing in it yet its contents were deadly.
Armand walked close to the door he had entered so as to get away speedily.
He looked around for airport police or airline staff but there was nobody near where he stood.
He looked to see if there were cameras where he stood but he could see none.
It was very busy in the airport so it would be difficult to see him.
Again, he felt a presence near him but when he looked, there was no one there.
He took out the small bottle containing the V112 virus and paused momentarily to consider the awesome consequences of his actions.
He tore off the metallic seal of the biological weapon with black leather gloves and twisted the top open.
The glass vial with the colourless liquid glistened in the sun.
He began to sweat as he glanced furtively around the departure lounge, looking out for anyone that might see him.
No one looked towards him.
The departure lounge was swarming with passengers preparing to enter airport customs, checking their bags and receiving their boarding tickets.
To them, this was a typical day and a predictable routine of preparing to board a plane.
It was not a typical day and Europe was going to face a catastrophic disaster greater than ever before experienced - within twenty-four hours.
Armand gingerly dropped the opened vial into a trolley beside the airport exit.
He walked quickly through the exit to the outside of the airport.
He jumped on the airport bus as it began to drive to the centre of Paris.
Armand rang Emmerich and spoke breathlessly: "It's done.
I didn't get stopped by anyone and I have released the virus.
The scientist has the money."
Emmerich replied: "Good Armand, well done.
I think we should celebrate.
I will pick you up from your apartment and you can come to my house and we could have takeaway pizza or whatever it is you would like.
What do you think?
Would you like that?"
'How wonderful', thought Armand.
Someone interested in him apart from his parents...... who anyway didn't talk to him much.
"Yes, I would like that Emmerich."
"I will collect you around eight o'clock tonight."
"See you then, Emmerich."
Armand took the bus home.
He did not completely understand what the result of his actions would be.
Emmerich understood exactly what would happen, it was part of his plan and the Dark Hoods, as he called the creatures who materialised in his sitting room,  wanted this.
They had poisoned whole populations before.
Emmerich knew now that he had a true accomplice, willing to do anything for him.
He knew that Armand 'loved' him.
Armand had never experienced love from his parents, and didn't know what real love was - he knew that much.
Emmerich was incapable of love but he could imitate and pretend to like someone.
He looked forward to tonight and how he would play with Armand, like a cat playing with a mouse.
Armand was in awe of Emmerich's home.
The driveway was dotted with mature oak trees.
The oak trees were tall, their thick branches and leaves stretching over to the road.
To Armand, they looked like soldiers guarding the entrance of Emmerich's home.
Emmerich drove up to the house and he could hear Armand gasp when he saw the mansion.
Armand stared at the ancient grey stone tower that the large modern house was adjoined to.
From the entrance, Armand could see a chandelier in the hall.
Emmerich opened the large redwood doors and gestured to Armand to enter.
Armand glanced along the walls of the hall.
Stuffed animals were spread along the corridor leading into the dining room.
Armand discovered a huge stuffed eagle that was hung from the ceiling in the middle of the hall.
He was mystified as to why Emmerich adorned his house with such ornamentation.
Emmerich led Armand into the dining room and they sat down.
Armand sat gingerly beside Emmerich.
A ten-foot, stuffed, hairy bear was frozen in time in the dining room beside a large, oak table.
Its big jaws opened to attack, its legs reared up and ready and flashing its huge claws.
An armoured knight stood beside the large Venetian window.
He held a huge sharp axe in one hand and a dangling metal ball with sharp edges.
The knight's armour was well-polished and shiny.
Armand was startled when Emmerich spoke.
"So Armand , what do you think of where I live?"
Armand answered, not in complete honesty.
He liked the structure of the house, it had an 'olde worlde' feel to it.
If he had money and he owned the mansion, he would add more warmth to the house.
He would get rid of all the imposing stuffed animals to begin with.
He felt intimidated by its decor- the bear and the knight especially spooked him.
"Oh, it's lovely Emmerich.
It's all so nice.
You've been very imaginative with the furniture".
"Thank You Armand.
Now would you like something to drink?
Whiskey, wine, beer?"
"A beer would be nice."
Emmerich glanced at Armand.
He bent over a bit more than necessary as he poured the beer.
He winked at Armand.
Armand's heart began to beat faster.
Emmerich talked casually with Armand as they drank beer.
Emmerich ordered Armand's favourite type of pizza.
They sat at the table, Armand sat beside the bear where Emmerich had seated him.
Armand was intimidated by the stuffed bear, it was so vicious looking.
Yet not vicious enough.... it had been killed and then stuffed.
They ate in silence for a few moments.
Emmerich looked at Armand and smiled.
"You've done such good work, Armand.
I think you are not aware of the consequences of what you have done but not to worry, you will know in time.
I want to reward you."
Emmerich opened a drawer and took out a bundle of money.
He walked over to Armand and put the money in Armand's lap.
Emmerich had given Armand five thousand euros.
"There you go Armand, spend it as you wish."
