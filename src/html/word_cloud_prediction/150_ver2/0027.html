For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.

The aspect of quality that is being judged is often implicit but may be expressed as the Purpose of the Evaluator's participation.   'Have you tried my latest get-rich-quick scheme? INI' 'Don tried out the bike to see if it was the right size.'"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 1.364198923110962, 'lexical_unit': 'mighty.a / powerless.a / powerful.a', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

He can become anything.
That's why it gives you the creeps.
It's more than an animal; it's like a human," he says.
How does he always know what I'm thinking?
We must really be connected in a way that I don't understand.
That train of thought slips from my head as we turn the corner to the stable.
Two beautiful, shiny horses are neighing and eating hay.
Damien walks up and strokes the brown horse's back.
It has a beautiful white mane and tail, and dark brown eyes.
"This is Bronco," he states, pointing to the brown horse.
"And this is Silver."
He points to the other one.
"She'll be your horse."
He runs his fingers through Silver's mane.
She's beautiful, all white with bright blue eyes and a silver mane and tail.
"She's been waiting on you; she's a Starlight.
They're special horses that have the ability to find their owner anywhere.
She's not claimed yet; you will have to claim her."
Damien grabs my hand, pulls a small knife out of his pocket, and, before I know it, has sliced open my finger.
Blood trickles down my finger into my palm.
"Now look into her eyes and call her; say her name.
Then press your hand to her lips.
You will know it took when she starts bucking.
The process will be complete when she stops.
Then she will be yours and you will be hers."
Is he serious?
I have to claim her?
"You will be able to find each other anywhere, and she will know what you need.
It takes a few minutes to claim her, so you'll want to get started."
I'm focusing intently on my finger; when I look up, Damien is leading Bronco out of the stable.
I turn back around, and Silver is standing too close for comfort.
I look deeply into her eyes, and my instincts take over.
I call her name, "Silver."
I touch her lips with my bloody finger, and she sticks her tongue out to lick it.
It's an odd sensation.
Her tongue feels like a cat's tongue, but it's as long as a dog's.
Suddenly, she's bucking like crazy, like she's in pain.
I want to help her, but am not sure how.
I just watch her for what feels like an eternity, but can only have been a few seconds.
She looks right at me, as if pleading for mercy.
The longer she looks at me, the worse I feel.
I'm getting dizzy on my feet, my head is aching, and I feel as if I'm going to collapse.
I do the only thing I can and reach toward her.
The second my fingers stroke her silver mane, she calms down.
It's as if I'm taking some of her pain away.
I feel a sense of understanding, as if she knows what I want, and I know everything about her.
My stomach settles.
She bends down, bowing to me.
I know, instinctively, that she's accepting me and offering me a ride.
I have claimed her.
My heart swells with love for this creature.
I walk toward her and swing my leg over her back, and she stands.
I pet her mane, as she walks out of the stable. ...
"So you did it, and it didn't take long, less than two minutes," Damien says, looking at his watch.
His surprise and excitement are radiating from him, now atop Bronco.
"So is Bronco your Starlight?"
It only seems logical, seeing as I get Silver.
"No, only Suppliants get Starlights.
Silver has been waiting for over 600 years for you.
There was another Suppliant, about fifty years ago, that people thought was the Suppliant from the prophecy.
It turned out, that she couldn't claim Silver.
She was killed in the process."
Damien looks down at his reins, as if this is hard for him to talk about.
"Did you know she wasn't the right Suppliant?
Why do people think she was?"
I think about it for a second, and suck in a breath when I realize.
"You thought you were her Protector?"
"Yes, I thought I was her Protector.
That's why people thought she was the Suppliant from the prophecy."
Silver stops walking for a moment; I look at Damien.
"How do you know I'm the Suppliant from the prophecy if you thought she was?"
I could just be another Suppliant, but not the one that the prophecies spoke of.
There has to be a way to know.
"You passed the test; you claimed Silver.
She was identified by the Light Queen as the Starlight to the Suppliant from the prophecy.
Whoever claimed Silver was the Suppliant from the prophecy," he says, still looking at the ground.
"Why didn't you tell me it was dangerous, and the last Suppliant died trying to claim Silver?
That could have been me," I shout at him.
I'm not sure why but I feel betrayed.
I feel like he should have told me that.
I look at him, and tears well up in my eyes.
Damien looks at me like there's something he wants to tell me.
Before I can comment, Damien looks at the ground and pulls back on his reins.
Bronco starts trotting, and Silver follows.
My answers will have to wait.
Chapter 11 Most of the ride is silent, which leaves me with a lot of time to think.
Still curious, who do I need protection from?
Who is the Dark Queen?
How am I supposed to find the Pendant?
What does the Pendant do anyway?
Why am I so connected to Damien?
My mind is spinning in a whirlwind.
I'm unsure what to think.
I've too many unanswered questions right now to consider this.
Yet, I keep getting this nagging feeling that Damien's telling me the truth.
It may not be the whole truth, but it's the truth that he knows.
Every time I look at Damien, I feel comforted.
I know he said we have a connection because he is my Protector, but I wonder where this relationship would lead.
Are we supposed to be together?
Could we be together?
Have Protectors and Suppliants in the past been together romantically?
How does this fit in with my plans to go to college?
There is something about Damien that gets to me.
I glance up at him, and wonder why he has a five o'clock shadow, if we aren't supposed to age in this realm.
I had figured that meant your hair wouldn't grow either, but I guess it does.
Maybe he already had the five o'clock shadow before and I never noticed it; that must be it.
I hear the birds chirping in the background, and it reminds me of the Morphon.
I wonder what other creatures are out there that I'm unaware of.
I'm having trouble wrapping my mind around the difference in time.
It's hard for me to believe that I could be gone for years and only lose minutes on earth.
What am I supposed to tell my parents and friends?
I feel Silver tense up under me.
I'm immediately on high alert.
Warning bells are going off in my head; there must be a reason she's tense.
I whisper for Damien, but he's too far away to hear me.
Out of the corner of my eye, I catch a shadow.
I glance that way, but there's nothing in sight.
I can't shake the feeling that something is wrong.
I decide to trust my instincts and stay on high alert.
A prickling sensation runs up my spine and down through my shoulders, and out my fingertips.
My chest tightens, and my breathing becomes labored.
Panic sets in.
Why is my body reacting this way?
It was just a shadow; I shouldn't be this scared.
"Damien!"
I shout.
His head begins to turn when I see it again.
The same shadow, the same robin.
This time, it flies so close, I can see every feather.
It grows in size, from mere inches, to a two--foot wingspan.
His bright orange beak is more jagged than it should have been.
His claws become sharp, pointy talons that can rip a person to shreds.
This transformation happens in a few seconds, completing only when he flies past.
Instinctively I know it will be back.
I also know that the next time it will cause damage.
My heart speeds up again, adrenaline pumping through my system.
I know that either I trust my instincts or I will get hurt.
"Go, as fast as you can!
Silver can take you there," Damien shouts as he circles back, catching a glimpse of the creature.
I dig my heels into Silver's side as she darts to the north.
After about twenty feet I decide to take a peek at Damien and see how he's faring.
As I turn, I catch a glimpse of him wielding two short knives, one in each hand.
The handles are an emerald green, with big opal stones.
They have a black intricate design that goes from the blade all the way down the handle.
He looks like a warrior, a Protector--my Protector.
For the moment I accept what he has told me as the truth, but that doesn't matter if Damien doesn't survive.
Silver stops as I watch Damien slicing into thin air, half a second late every time.
The robin swoops back down, gnashing his talons, and catching Damien's shoulder.
I can see the pained look on his face.
Anger wells up inside me; I feel protective.
