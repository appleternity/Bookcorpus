That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

He had been alright with the voice they had heard, but Tom was a pretend-to-be-brave twelve-year-old boy who had a front to uphold and Bess knew a lot of it was just an act.
She certainly didn't want him to freak out.
There could also be the chance he might not believe her.
Who would?
She wondered if she told her friend Eloise all about seeing a boy from over a century ago what she would think.
All of these thoughts ran through her mind and she pictured herself in a straitjacket.
Bess grabbed the handful of photographs, left her room and headed downstairs.
Surely her mum would be finished by now.
Mother and daughter sat sipping tea and looking through the old photos, around them the day passed with the smell of beef sizzling away in the oven.
The usual droning of the television and chatter about football sounded in the background as Tom spent time with their father.
Bess was anxious to get to the photo of the boy, but she had to be a little patient.
She didn't want her mum to think there was any other reason for it, just in case she started asking weird questions.
"This is your Aunt Josephine.
A few generations back of course.
I remember my nan telling me stories about her.
She was very strong and rebellious and caused a lot of trouble when she was a teenager.
They had all sorts of problems with her.
She wanted to be a carpenter because she enjoyed working with wood and it wasn't really a profession chosen by women at the time, so there was a lot of controversy.
I think she actually got her way in the end though," her mother recalled.
"I wish I knew more about her, she actually sounds very interesting."
"What about this boy?
Who is he?"
Bess asked showing her mother the photo of the boy.
"Hmmm...
I know he was one of your ancestors, but I can't remember how he's related.
I think he was around the same age as Josephine and connected to the family somehow, but it's difficult to say for sure."
"It looks as though his name was Philip, it's written on the back of the photograph," Bess said prompting her mother to turn the picture over and look at the back.
She hoped it would jog her memory.
"I know there was some sort of story about this boy Philip, but I really can't remember it.
I do know he spent some time away from his family when he was around this age, but I can't remember where he went.
Perhaps into hospital for a while due to an illness or something like that.
I can tell you they were very poor though.
I know he had a lot of brothers and sisters, but I can't remember much more than that.
Sorry," she apologised.
"Thanks Mum, it doesn't really matter," Bess lied, feeling subdued by the lack of knowledge.
"It's just that there are so many pictures of people I don't know, and it would be nice to find out who a few of them are."
"Your Aunty Jane might know a little more, she put together the family tree.
I'd forgotten about that.
I have a copy here somewhere, I'll get it out later and you can see if you can find that boy Philip on it.
It might give us more of a clue as to where he fits in," her mother told her.
"But while I finish preparing the roast dinner, you might want to have a look in the big cupboard under the stairs and save me the trouble.
I think I put it in there."
Bess didn't hesitate, she went straight to the cupboard.
Wonderfully eccentric Aunty Jane who always seemed to be travelling and never did anything by half.
She had forgotten about Jane and her intrepid projects.
The family tree had taken a considerable amount of work and a long time.
But she did remember when it arrived in the post.
It had been in a long cardboard tube and Bess was hoping her mother had left it in the postage tube to store it.
The cupboard under the stairs was the place where things went never to be seen again.
As she hunted through boxes, Bess discovered an old wind up tin duck she remembered from when she was a lot younger.
Stepping out of the storage area, she wound the key in the side of the toy and put it down on the floor.
Bess smiled as the little yellow duck waddled along while the key turned.
When it came to a complete stop, she returned it to its home in the cardboard box and picked up a long tube with a hole in the end.
Not the family tree that she was searching for, but a kaleidoscope.
Leaving the muted artificial light of the cupboard, Bess put one eye to the hole and closed the other one.
Turning a dial at the end slowly, for a moment she was mesmerised by the colourful shapes formed within.
Tiny fragments moved into place easily putting on a vibrant display that resembled flowers.
Bess smiled as she remembered being a lot younger and thinking the toy was magic.
She put the kaleidoscope back in the box and continued looking for the family tree.
There was so much stuff their mother had kept, it was ridiculous really.
Bess told herself right then and there, when she was older and had a place of her own, she wouldn't be hoarding a load of junk, even if there was some emotional attachment or whatever reason her mother kept it.
Finally, after looking through four boxes of what she could only describe as stuff that belonged in the bin, she found the cardboard tube with the sought after document.
"What's that?"
Tom asked coming down the stairs.
"It's our family tree," Bess told him as she passed him.
"I'm going to try to find that boy in the picture.
I'll do it after dinner, there's something I need to tell you about him."
"Awesome, let's eat and then you can fill me in on the secret," he whispered excitedly.
Bess wondered how excited Tom would be when he found out she had seen the boy or someone like him a week or so earlier near the old ruins.
She was sure he would freak out and never want to visit the building again.
That was something she didn't want, but since he was involved in trying to work out what this was all about, he had a right to know everything.
She needed him to help her.
Tom was her alibi and if she didn't have an alibi, visiting the old school would be almost impossible.
Bess couldn't keep faking sick days forever and she couldn't rely on Eloise, she would probably blab to somebody and word would get around and eventually reach her parents.
Bess would be in a lot of trouble and possibly grounded for life.
She left the cardboard tube on her bed and headed back downstairs.
"Tom, let's go to my room," Bess said to her brother when they finished the meal.
"Unless of course you want us to help you with the clearing up Mum."
"No, that's fine.
It's good to see you two spending time together," their mother told them both smiling.
Heading upstairs together, they went straight to her bedroom.
She picked up the tube and removed the plastic cap from the end.
Inside there was a rolled-up chart which Bess removed and unrolled on the bed.
"Why are we looking at this?"
Tom asked his sister.
"We need to see if we had a relative called Philip," Bess told him, not quite ready to reveal her secret yet.
"Start looking around the 1900s and see if you can see anyone with that name."
"Philip, Philip, Philip," Tom muttered as he pointed to the names one at a time.
Bess watched him doing her best not to laugh at his thinking-out-loud method and then turned her attention to another part of the chart to search for the name.
The family tree put together by their aunt was very extensive and Bess thought about the amount of research that must have gone into something like this.
She wouldn't have known where to start, but Aunty Jane had obviously been relentless in her pursuit because the result was amazing.
There were so many names Bess had never heard before and she wondered if there were pictures of the unknown ancestors in the box.
It would be worth looking on the backs of the photos to get an idea where they fit in the family history.
It made her think of her father's family and she wondered if any of their relatives on his side had started a family tree.
She would ask him later, it might be something that she could do herself.
On the other hand, it sort of reminded her of school work and the project that Bess and her brother were working on at the moment was enough for now at least.
"I can't see the name Philip anywhere on this piece of paper," Tom said.
"Did you see it anywhere?"
"No, it's really odd.
There's a reason I wanted to find this boy too, it's not just the photo Tom, it's something else and I'm not sure whether to tell you or not," Bess told him.
"What is it Bess?
What is it you're keeping from me?"
Tom asked his sister.
"Okay, but this is a secret too.
It sounds crazy, but here goes anyway.
A few weeks ago I was passing the old school house and I stopped to take a look at it.
Eloise came along and dragged me away, but before I turned from the track into the street, I looked back.
I saw a boy standing on the path near the school.
I thought he was one of the boys that were in pictures that I had seen on the internet, but I still wasn't really completely sure.
I didn't think too much more about it until we found the picture when we got the box of stuff from Nan.
Tom, the boy I saw on that day is the boy in this photo," Bess explained handing the photo to her brother.
"This boy is called Philip, and Mum said that she had heard the name mentioned in stories but couldn't remember much about him.
If he is related to us, he should be on the family tree chart, but his name isn't there.
I don't get it Tom.
He's also in the photos of the school in a book that I got from the library.
He has to be a real person and if he's in this box of photos then he must be one of our ancestors."
"Wait, so you saw this boy.
Does that mean that you saw a ghost?
Does that mean that the old school house is really haunted?"
Tom asked.
"Is it his voice that we heard?"
"I'm not sure," she answered hesitantly, searching her brothers face for a sign of fear.
"But I'm sure I saw him near the old school."
"Cool, let's go back there.
We might be able to see some other ghosts.
Maybe we should have a seance," Tom suggested.
"There could be loads of ghosts hanging out there.
I wonder if we could get a photograph of one.
We could sell it.
Or contact the television stations and film our own show."
"I think we need one of those seance people who actually conjure the dead to be able to talk to ghosts, but we can definitely go back there.
I don't think we should be contacting the media just yet though."
Bess told him.
"But who knows what might happen.
He might reappear so we can ask him a few questions.
Like where is the cornerstone and why are we looking for it?"
"Tomorrow after football training.
We can pretend to go for another run.
The weather is going to clear up tonight so it won't be really wet.
Should we do it?"
he asked excitedly.
"Okay, as soon as you get home from football training, we'll go out," Bess agreed.
They turned their attention back to the box of photos and looked on the backs to see if they could put faces to the names on the family tree chart.
Bess was surprised by her brother's reaction and although she was pleased with his enthusiasm, there were a few things that bothered her.
Who was Philip, why did she see him and where did this boy fit into the family?
Bess hoped she would get some answers at the old school house and couldn't wait for the next evening to come around.
Chapter Eight Things didn't go exactly to plan, and almost two weeks went by before Bess and Tom had a chance to escape together to investigate the ruin again.
With sport, friends, homework, family, and bad weather continually getting in the way, Bess found the situation frustrating and started to wonder if there would ever be another chance to get out with her brother.
She desperately wanted to go back to the school and search for the cornerstone.
To add to it all, there was also the mystery of the boy named Philip they needed to clear up.
