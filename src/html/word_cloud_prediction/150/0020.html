The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

When attention is focused on a Salient_entity, then mention of a global Experience is excluded and typically, but not always, either a State or Impression of the Salient_entity is presented.  \'\' Episodic memory is the  explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.   \'Kozmo could remember when his modem was the fastest he could buy.\'  \'That\'s probably before my time, which was long time ago, Fish may remember that time.\'  \'Who remembers me being a total dork and going up to everyone saying "Hey, I\'m Ashley Hunt from Chicago"!?!\'   \' I wanted to remember how good that felt.\'  \'Hummel says staff, both students and professional, remember  her as a "very good friend, available for new staff and well-respected by everyone."\'   \'Somehow I remember him as older, with long eyelashes, and doe eyes.\'  \'When he died he was just a kid himself but for some reason at the age of 44 I still remember him as older than me. \'  \'Retro games are great, but a lot of the time people get clouded by nostalgia and remember them to be better than they really were\'  \'He remembered him as a kindly man but not a very lively one. \'  \'The part I vividly remember was about a South Seas tramp steamer captain . \''}, {'frame': 'Substance', 'tfidf': 0.5499866918987549, 'lexical_unit': 'gas.n / sand.n / oil.n / liquid.n / methane.n / chemical.n / iron.n / material.n / uranium.n / aluminum.n / plutonium.n / atropine.n / yellowcake.n / solid.n / ore.n / petroleum.n / water.n / juice.n / metal.n / glass.n / paper.n / mud.n / cement.n / calcium.n / oxygen.n / fertilizer.n', 'definition': 'This frame concerns internally undifferentiated Substances.   \'As their gut bacteria ferment cellulose , they generate methane gas , which escapes from the rear ends of the insects.\'  \' The pipes are leaking noxious gas.\'  \'Some CH-47 "Bombers" were equipped to roll-out riot control gas or napalm onto Viet Cong bunker complexes from the rear cargo ramp.\''}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 0.5423877838465715, 'lexical_unit': 'strong.a / weak.a / mighty.a / power.n / might.n / forceful.a / force.n / strength.n / weakness.n / powerful.a / powerless.a', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read the it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a 3 minutes time lock for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see two sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

"Anything interesting?"
Will asked out of politeness, rather than inquisitiveness.
"Gidwell, Blackwater, amulets, serial killers, vampires.
Now I have the proper name, I've found out quite a lot."
"And?"
Will hoped she'd found out enough to persuade her not to believe his book's fantastic theories.
"Must be something in it."
"In my fantastic theory?"
"In the well."
Will sighed.
The well had probably been filled in over 700 years ago, and anything left behind would be useless.
He knew roughly where the well was, but it was little more than a boggy depression now.
"Even if we knew where the well was, we couldn't dig it out."
"Maybe.
No harm trying."
Will envisioned all manner of harm - broken back, mud, exhaustion, sweat, a lynching-mob of furious locals, furious frogs, cholera, black death, prison, mocking - to name but a few.
"Well, it's too wet now."
"You're wet."
Will slapped her thigh.
It felt good.
He pretended his hand was ricocheting in order to make the most of it.
Alice didn't flinch.
"Will, do you want me to go?"
"Go where?"
"Home."
"No. No. No."
Will considered a fourth no.
"Then humour me."
"No.
I mean, yes.
That no belonged with the other nos. Err, we'll do whatever you want."
"Good boy."
Alice allowed her hand to ricochet off Will's firm thigh.
"Nice legs."
"Not as nice as yours."
Alice smiled with her eyes.
She took Will's hand and placed it against the soft pink flesh.
"If it feels good, do it."
Will agreed it felt good, but wasn't sure what it was, or why she was being so friendly.
His hand froze; he was on the edge, unsure whether to jump off and break something, or climb up and be pushed from the top.
He decided to await mountain rescue.
"Move and you're dead."
Alice grinned.
Will was stuck on the edge and felt the noose tighten.
"Oooooo."
Alice was getting excited.
Will wondered if now was the time to climb.
"Ghosts.
Reports of ghosts.
We must go at night."
Will was rocking.
Alice was approaching climax.
"People have seen ghosts of victims, and the mad monk appears, in the actual well itself."
"Drunk people see ghosts."
Alice smirked.
"Then we'll take wine.
And Old Bob."
Will didn't believe in ghosts, but that didn't stop him being scared of them.
He figured a mad-monk, serial-killer ghost might be scarier than most, and if he really had to visit that creepy ruin at night, Old Bob would be a comforting companion.
He decided to take Betty Stoggs along too.
She was a Cornish folklore character and also a fine ale.
"We go tonight, rain or shine."
Will frowned.
"Shine?"
"You're so pedantic."
Will agreed he was.
"We can rest today."
"Now you're talking sense."
Will was an expert in the art of relaxation.
Alice shut the netbook and crawled under the duvet.
Will lifted the cover over their heads, laying face-to-face.
Heated breath quickly warmed their insulated world.
"What shall we do now?"
Alice's eyes were locked onto Will's.
"Snuggling is good."
"Good answer."
She tickled him and he giggled like a child.
"Are you ticklish, Will?"
"Are you?"
"No!"
Alice's squealing recoil alerted Will to the possibility of a deception, and he aimed his wriggling fingers at her sides.
Alice jerked away and Will's hand landed firmly and squarely on top of her right breast.
They both flinched.
"Oops, sorry."
"Do that again and you're dead."
It seemed a fair trade-off, but he feared she might miss his heart and just wound him.
He didn't want to end up horribly mutilated but alive.
Alice moved closer so that both sets of arms were disabled.
They lay with knees and hands touching, arms bent in a prayer position.
She grasped his hands and he wrapped them around hers.
"Let's play a game."
"Didn't bring my pool cue."
"Anything wooden?"
"Only my heart."
Alice swrinked.
"Truth or dare?"
"Unless the dare involves tickling your palms or making funny faces, I think it'll have to be truth."
"Will," Alice put on her serious face, "Putting aside the fact you're twice my age and we only just met, would you have tried to have your wicked-way with me last night, being as I was drunk an' all, if I wasn't famous?"
"Well, putting aside the fact I'm slightly under twice your age, fat, ugly, have bad teeth, am a total loser, and descended from a different species ... no."
"Why not?
And ... an hour a day in the gym and a good dentist would sort you out, not that you need it that badly."
"You were drunk."
"Isn't that how most people end up having sex?"
"Probably, but most people never grow up.
Reproduction is for adolescents.
There's more to life than endless bouts of drinking, shagging and fighting."
Alice looked genuinely impressed, which pleased Will - if she hadn't understood that, she wasn't the person he thought she was, and not worthy of his adulation.
Will pulled back the duvet, sensing he was about to overcook.
They took in the fresh air.
"So you're celibate?
Like a monk - a mad monk!"
"And I'm a vampire.
And I must say you look very tasty."
"Nah, I taste of lemons."
"I like sucking lemons."
"Dry, shrivelled, wrinkly old lemons covered in puss?"
"Maybe I'll give it a miss."
"You must want sex sometimes."
Alice had a bone and was not about to let it go.
"Yes of course.
Believe it or not, I can control my libido.
It's called being a grown-up."
Alice mused.
She thought she was mature, but Will was positively antique.
"You must have will power, Will, not to have tried it on last night.
I was vulnerable."
"What makes you think I wanted to try it on with you?"
Alice, for the first time, tasted defeat.
"Oh, OK.
Sorry.
I guess I'm not Anna Faris, or Sarah Michelle Gellar," she looked around, "or ...
Christina Aguilera??"
"She's covering some flaky paint ...
I'm not sure you get it."
"We get flaky paint."
Will laughed involuntarily.
Few people had the gift, basically because he was always the wit.
It was one of his few redeeming features and probably the only reason he got invited to dinner parties these days.
"If you really want my opinion ..."
Will began.
"I do."
"First, physical age doesn't matter to me, as long as the girl is younger."
"Sexist!"
"Women mature quicker.
It's a biological fact."
"Sexist pig.
Go on."
"I think a man and a woman can be close, physically and emotionally, without the man feeling he needs to stick his dick in her."
"Crude, but fair point."
"If courtship were a degree course, then sex should come after the ceremony, not on freshers' day."
