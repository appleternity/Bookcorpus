That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

They can provide directions to the Dragon's Cave at Area 10 Area 10 Blue Dragon's Cave Deeper within the jungle you find a huge volcano with a gigantic hole in the side.

For torching the monsters the King also grants each of the PCs the title of Lord of Sileeria and their very own castle strongholds to defend and administer to.
See: High Level Characters Strongholds in the full Challenger book.
Chapter Five: Killer Dungeon Having tended to your great kingdoms for several months you find yourselves growing antsy about the lack of adventures, loot, princesses, dragons, and monsters to kill.
You all meet up at your old pub and start to talk about old times until you can't resist it anymore and go looking for an adventure.
You soon find a trail of inscrutable rumors that lead you to a far off land where a Kingdom known as Eastmark has been completely swallowed by a rogue dungeon by the name of "The Terminator".
The tales bards have spun lead you to believe that all those 'eaten' by the dungeon may yet be freed if you complete your quest within the week before they're digested by the dungeon and it moves on to another kingdom, naturally, this would mean saving a princess.
The dungeon, it is said, can only be killed by finding its 'heart' and stabbing it with the sword of Sebarath.
If no one has the sword of Sebarath from the previous adventure you can allow them to go on a minor side quest to retrieve it.
The Three Witches Before you can reach the fabled maw and entry of the Dungeon "Terminator" you stumble into the camp of three witches: one fat, one small, and one tall.
They all snicker and cast dire portents about you growing old, fat, and arthritic all of which are obvious lies, you all having been smart enough to drink from the Holy Grail, right?
If the PCs don't have the sword of Sebarath the witches hand it to them.
It's a longsword +2 which glows bright blue and once per day can blow through solid stone for +1d6 damage.
The Entry to The Dungeon The morning mists part before you on a desolate field where a thriving kingdom once stood.
A shiver runs down your spine as you see a tall beam sticking out of the ground where a pub like your own once stood.
Someone's leg juts up at an odd angle, and then you spot the entry to the Dungeon known as "Terminator".
It appears to be a wide gaping maw looking up at the sky with non-existent eyes.
Its long teeth are made of solid stone and between each row of razor-sharp incisors is a smooth stairway leading down and within invitingly.
Anyone foolish enough to enter is eaten in short order.
RR 20 to escape or evade.
Damage 4d6 per round if eaten until trapped with the other occupants of the kingdom (out of the game).
After the first few non-important henchmen die, the witches return with a new warning.
You see the witches drifting over the moors toward you with some concern.
"Not that way, you fools, you must attack it and somehow anger it into revealing its true entry."
Anyone may attack the front of the beast without entering within, but doing so is extremely risky as the mouth can thrash around and eat people.
Dungeon Mouth RR 17 HP 40 Damage 4d6 and if killed eaten and trapped within RR 22 to break out.
Speed: 3 (one area) Gold: 0 XP: 0 Using ranged attacks and magic on the mouth deals damage to it, but at 0 hp the mouth simply collapses and then regenerates at full hp in 1 round and laughs.
You should let the PCs try all manner of stuff on the mouth.
They must perform at least 5 of the following tasks to get the beast angry enough to fully surface and present its true entry: Set fire to it, laugh at it or otherwise taunt it, use frost on it, use acid on it, strike it for at least 15 damage in one blow, spit on it, kick it, call it a son of a piece of rock or similar, blow it's mouth to pieces, seduce it, bluff it, trick it, give it a riddle it can't solve, or pay it 1,000 gp or more.
The Angered Beast With a huge roar the ground shifts and with a massive earthquake the beast surfaces, momentarily exposing its soft underbelly and thus a way inside.
The dungeon resembles a huge crocodile made of stone and cannot be killed in this form no matter how hard the PCs try and what they do to it.
Smashing into its soft underbelly requires at least 10 points of damage and a RR 14 speed check to get inside before the beast tries to step on you.
RR 15 or take 2d6 crushing damage.
The Dungeon Once again you should doodle out a little map and assign the encounter areas as you see fit.
The tunnels are narrow, uncomfortable, and hot and moist as if the PCs are inside a living breathing beast.
Encounter 1 The Corridor As you walk down a very long corridor the beast that is the dungeon shakes with mirth and the back walls closes in until you can see nothing.
The front of the cave starts to narrow and contract until you are being crushed between the walls.
Hacking madly away at the walls for at least 25 damage in 2 rounds will prevent automatic death (1/2 hp first round, all other hp second round).
Teleporting, causing the beast to sneeze, or other tricks may also work.
Encounter 2 Endless Fall Corridor As you merrily march down a tight passage the floor suddenly opens up without warning into a million foot pit into molten magma.
Everyone screams and falls.
RR 16 Acrobatics may grab a ledge or part of the wall.
RR 16 may climb out of the wall, flying and teleporting are naturally useful, and being immune to magma may help but the fall still deals 6d6 damage.
Encounter 3 Diamond Room You wander through a huge maze of shifting corridors and passages until you get lucky and find a room full of diamonds growing out of the walls.
If the diamonds are snapped off more grow back in their place.
Any henchmen of the PCs immediately start cackling and filling their packs with the loot unless a PC rolls RR 17 intimidation or similar to order them not to.
The diamonds appear to be real, but further probing may reveal they have a magical aura. 3 minutes after taken the diamonds turn to molten acid dealing 2d6 damage each to anyone who took them and melting their gear.
Naturally, people who took loads of diamonds take a lot of damage.
Encounter 4 Magma Storm As you bumble around a series of passages you feel a fell wind on your face and a red glow approaches from up the corridor.
Next second a wall of magma is rushing towards you!
The magma is real and quite lethal.
Even if it is avoided the dungeon will start spitting walls of acid, frost, and whatever else it can think of until the PCs hack into the wall and carve a passage to the beast's lungs.
There they must carve flying discusses and fling themselves into its esophagus before they hit the stomach acid and down those passages they find Encounter Area 5 if they hadn't already in which case they go to the next highest number and so forth.
Encounter 5 The Beast's Stomach Tunneling through the belly of the beast you reach a large waste chamber where you find the remnants of a hundred kingdoms groaning and lying in the dust of destroyed empires.
Magical lights in the shape of the beast's eyeballs swivel around and watch your progress as you comfort the survivors.
Behind you the route you took seals up.
The survivors aren't terribly helpful.
They just tell the PCs every day a load of them are vaporized as they are consumed by the terrible dungeon beast.
There appears to be no way out of the beast's waste chamber and the vaporizing beam randomly hits people as they wander and lie about.
Hacking their way out is the only way for the PCs to free themselves.
Hacking HP 15 per round to make progress.
Must strike 3 consecutive rounds to escape or re-seals up.
If the PCs manage to hack an escape route everyone cheers and starts running away.
It is likely no one will make it out alive unless the PCs can find the heart and stab it with the sword.
The beast shudders as you strike through it's waste chamber walls and the people scream in victory and flee in droves, probably only to fall in the stomach again and come straight back here.
You must find the heart and stab it with the sword before it's too late and the beast decides no one's worth the trouble anymore and kills you all.
Encounter 6 The Crunch Room On your way to the heart you pass through a chamber full of goblins shoveling gold into a giant furnace which, apparently, powers the creature in some way.
The goblins have no objection to the PCs stealing as much gold as they can carry and smashing the furnace which causes the beast to howl with fury and leap up onto land, it shakes all the corridors and rooms as it lurches for the PCs homeland intending to eat it all and lay it completely to waste and ruin.
If they don't arrive in time their favourite pub and their castles may lie in ruins.
Encounter 7 The Sneeze You burst past the lungs and see the heart of the beast lying on a pedestal, ripe for the stabbing.
Before you can reach it with your lightning reflexes the beast sneezes and you fly topsy turvy out of its mouth and land on the ground in a heap.
The PCs see the beast storming off over the countryside, smashing down forests, and heading for their home kingdom while trailing out magma blood from all the wounds it's sustained in battle with them.
They must somehow catch up and cut through its underbelly, then find their way back to the heart again.
Encounter 8 Magma Men You come back to the chamber with the heart and before you can reach it a dozen magma men materialize before you and shoot beams of fire at you.
An energy bubble springs to existence before the heart blocking any teleportation within and the magma men bar entry to the heart stone.
Magma Man RR 19 HP 15 Damage 1d6+7 See Invisible Speed: 3 Gold: 50 XP: 1,000 each.
There are 10 of them.
A hit sets the PC on fire 1d6 damage per round unless you spend a whole round to roll out the flames.
Frost deals x2 damage to the magma men and they melt non-magical weapons which hit them.
Encounter 9 The Heart You finally stand before the heart and raise the sword on high to strike the death blow.
If the PCs haven't fought the magma men yet proceed to Encounter 8, otherwise they can stab the heart and the beast flings them and the survivors of the massacred kingdoms out onto the ground.
It's just reached the PCs own kingdom and everyone is running around and screaming and shooting at it.
It appears the beast isn't dead yet.
Without the heart it is now vulnerable to normal damage, but it's enraged and ripping apart your home kingdom with a vengeance.
Dungeon Beast (colossal) RR 20 HP 60 Damage 3d6 Speed: 5 Gold: 10,000 XP: 7,000 Eat Whole as per the Old Dragon in the Challenger Book.
There should be a huge battle, the Sword of Sebarath hits on RR 15 and deals x2 damage against the beast.
If the PCs slay the beast they are the heroes of the survivors and of their kingdom who names a pub, babies, and several streets after them; and the king even personally throws a feast in their honor and bestows knighthood or some similar privileges on them.
Any surviving PCs gain 3,000 xp apiece for their heroic efforts and being foolish enough to go after the Dungeon Terminator in the first place.
Chapter Six: Wrath of the Gods Your renown is now such that few foes trouble you, you are hailed in the streets as celebrities, you never want for food, gold, or women; and you command the undying loyalty of your many valorous henchmen.
You're just starting to think maybe you can retire in peace, when one final challenge besets you.
Ioth, the God of secrets, summons you to a secret council meeting.
You can refuse of course, but then he'll probably curse you with something fairly nasty as uber beings are wont to do.
Using mighty magical portals, their own abilities, or whatever nutty things you can come up with (such as jumping to the moon or entering a volcanic frost gate) all of the PCs manage to attend the meeting should they so wish.
It's on an alternate dimension where Ioth has ultimate power so they won't be able to challenge him unless they can find a way to become Gods themselves.
Ioth You find yourself on a vast open field of dark energy.
A huge table materializes before you and a giant, one-eyed Cyclops wrapped in the ancient clothes of a mummy appears before you.
This is Ioth.
He says nothing but visions fill your head, terrible visions of Gods at war and universes splitting apart in the mayhem.
In the brief second he touches your mind you know what you must do.
You must descend into the underworld and capture Hades who, as always, is responsible for this mess.
Next, you must travel to Mount Olympus where the Norse Gods happen to be visiting and beat the crap out of all the famous deities to distract them long enough for Hades' curse to wear off so they don't start a God-war that will rip apart many universes killing trillions of innocent dragons and your home plane of existence.
Your reward?
Ioth apparently has promised you the honeyed nectar of immortality but you inform him you've already got that mate, so he offers to make one of you a God, sort of a lotto 649 sort of thing, as it were.
Naturally, you accept, because of the prospect of saving zillions of innocent lives, not Godhood which has no appeal to you whatsoever.
When the PCs are done bargaining with, fighting, and generally badgering Ioth he waves his hand and banishes them to the underworld (once they're suitably prepared of course).
If anyone asks how they're supposed to fight Gods, he also gives them a map to a treasure store of magical god-whooping weaponry hidden on their prime material plane.
If nobody asks he just lets them go without it in the well-founded belief they know what they're doing and will find their own way to battle the Gods.
Apparently, Hades has brainwashed the other Gods into temporarily believing they're at war so they'll fight and let him seize control of the Godly government and a lot of loot.
The Underworld Ioth waves his hand bidding you good luck in your minds and you appear in the underworld next to the boatman of the river Styx.
If you're history lessons are correct, you'll probably need to pay him at least 1 gp to cross and furthermore run into a giant 3-headed dog named Cerberus.
The dog is no trouble, but you find yourself saddened at the prospect of giving up one of your beloved gold coins.
The boatman will indeed take people on for one gold coin, but if they make it clear they have a lot of money, he'll be sure to up the price.
Anyone attempting to swim in the river of death or fight the boatman will more than likely instantly die with no saving throw.
Cerebus In the gloom of the waters ahead you see a bright light and hear a load of snarling.
As you round the bend in the passage you see a huge 3-headed dog snarling at you.
He appears to be the nastiest, biggest monster you've ever faced in your career, including the dragons.
Anyone who fights Cerebus will probably die, but those calling him, "Such a good boy" or throwing him meat become his eternal friends.
Cerebus HP 1,000 RR 20 Damage 1d6x10 Speed: 5 Gold: 0 XP: 1,000 (2,000 for bypassing).
Hades You climb a massive 300 mile high mountain made of bones but don't get tired for some reason.
