In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read the it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see two sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

No!"
Hobs looked shocked.
"Bugul, we can't swim across.
We could drown.
Be reasonable."
"Uh-uh," Bugul got out.
It was an obvious no. Hobs helpfully supplied Bugul with yet more reasons for his resistance, "Steal a boat?
Well, I guess if you want."
"Uh-uh," Bugul grunted with more force.
"Oh, just borrow it?
Okay, we'll take it from the nymphs, although for the record I'm shocked you would suggest such a thing."
"Uh-uh!"
Bugul shook his fist for emphasis.
"It's not very honest--that's why I'm shocked.
Borrowing without asking is usually called stealing."
By now, Hobs was trying not to laugh outright.
The goblin had gone scarlet with rage.
"But we'll do it."
He reserved an apologetic look for me.
"Bugul is a daredevil.
I hope you're okay with that."
Bugul spun from us to pace the snowy clearing by the trees.
I couldn't understand why he didn't storm off, but the two must be better friends than I thought.
Bugul gestured with a meaty fist for me to follow him.
I gawked, not sure what he meant to do.
He made muttering sounds, and I left Hobs to investigate.
I couldn't figure out what Bugul was trying to tell me until he gave a sigh of impatience and drew something in the snow.
Babs and I stared over his shoulder at his artwork.
He poked some holes in the white powder and made a squiggly mark around them.
"Is it a map?"
I asked.
He nodded.
Hobs leaned over it too, and Bugul pushed him back roughly.
"What's the squiggly?"
I asked.
"A snake?"
Hobs guessed.
Bugul stopped his drawing to glare at him.
"Crystal Lake?"
I asked.
I tried to warm my hands against Babs' neck.
She smiled up at me.
Bugul watched us with a piercing look, then nodded again.
"Then what are the dots?"
I asked.
This time Hobs stayed silent, his lip curled up.
"A forest?"
I guessed.
Bugul shook his head.
"Villages?
Houses?
Cottages?
Condos?"
Bugul was about to shake his head off.
He made bigger pokey marks in the squiggly line as if that made things clearer.
Was there something in the water?
"Alligators?"
I asked.
"Crocodiles?"
I was closer this time.
Bugul got excited and acted out combing seriously long hair.
Babs laughed.
"Oh great, we're back to the nymphs again."
Hobs threw his hands up.
"I thought we were past that."
I circled on Hobs, knowing he was trying to throw us off.
The wind picked up, chilling me from my scalp to my numb toes.
We didn't have time for games.
"Take it back."
"What?"
"Take it back!
Your curse.
It's stupid.
Make it so he can talk again!"
Hobs hesitated.
"I'd love to, but it's a time dependent spell.
It only wears off."
"Then what's he really trying to say?
Answer me that.
You're keeping something from us and I want to know what!"
Hobs gave in with a shrug.
"He's trying to warn you about the Merrow.
He'd rather face the nymphs than them."
Bugul sagged in relief.
That was it?
"I don't understand why you're so against nymphs, besides their music and all.
How can Merrow possibly be less scary?"
"The Merrow are green with razor-sharp teeth, and the nymphs will grant you your every wish."
Hobs acted like that was worse.
"So?"
"You don't want that."
He looked stern.
The cold Sidhe wind ran through my hair.
I hopped up and down in the snow to ward off the chill.
"You want to know what my first wish to the nymphs will be?
Huh?
To be warm!
Maybe I'll ask for some earmuffs too--something crazy like that!"
"Are you serious?
We're almost to the faery queen's, and that's what you want?"
Hobs' gaze slid over my clothes, and then he looked over at Babs and let out a sigh.
"You'll never pass as a nymph in that outfit."
I stopped dancing around in the snow.
Was he going to follow Bugul's advice?
He would trespass nymph territory?
Hobs mussed the top of Babs' hair.
The poor girl was drowning in his jacket with my Midsummer Dream's costume, which made me wonder what my shadow was wearing for the play at home.
I tried not to think about it.
"Maybe if you had packed us some real clothes," I said.
"I wouldn't be throwing away my wishes on something warm."
Hobs ignored me, tapping Babs' forehead with his finger.
Her costume lost its wings and pulled into Babs' tiny frame.
The skirt became little khaki pants and the ballerina top turned into a pink-striped sweater.
A long white coat layered over her, replacing Hobs' oversized jacket.
Her hands grew matching mittens.
Soon she was wearing fur-trimmed boots.
She looked warm and absolutely adorable.
"Did you really just--?"
My lips trembled with the cold that he could've alleviated with a mere tap of his fingers.
"What else can you do that you haven't been telling me about?"
"That's it.
I'm just the brave little tailor who could."
Bugul snorted in derision.
I felt the same way.
What a liar!
"And you couldn't go brave little tailor on us sooner?
I'm about to freeze to death!"
"Oh, c'mon, you just think you are.
We're in the Sidhe after all!
Besides, I only have so much Fringe power on reserve, and you want me to waste it all on clothes?"
I gave him my best pleading eyes, and after a moment of resisting, he growled out a complaint and tapped my head.
Soon I was wearing go-go boots with lots of black hair toppling over my head--completely covering the tiara I wore.
I looked like a sixties dancer and I wasn't any warmer, especially my legs.
"There," he said.
"You'll fit in perfectly with the nymphs now!"
I tugged at my skirt.
"I refuse to believe that your nymph friends are stuck in the sixties!"
"It's disturbing how well you know me."
Before he could change me back--and I could only give him the benefit that he had every intention of doing so--twinkling wisps of balled-up light looking suspiciously like Christmas tree ornaments flitted through the air toward us.
More oozed from the frosty trees, making the leaves lose their glow.
"It isn't too late to run," Hobs told Bugul.
The goblin stubbornly stood his ground.
"Surprise!"
I heard tiny voices shout.
We were surrounded by the beautiful little things.
It was like they had been waiting for us to join their big faery bash.
"Oh, he's back!
He's back!"
the faeries shrieked as soon as they recognized Hobs.
"Hip, hip, hurray!"
