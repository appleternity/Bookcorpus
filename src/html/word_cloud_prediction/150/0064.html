The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

But you go ahead."
"No, no, darling.
I'll just sit here and wait for you."
She smiled.
I smiled back and headed up the stairs with my overnight bag.
My room tonight was the same room I grew up in, and it hadn't changed appreciably in the nine years since I left it.
It hadn't changed much in the hundred and fifty before that, either.
I'd had a few low-brow posters hanging on the wall at one time, and they had disappeared, but otherwise everything was the same.
The bed that my great-grandfather Richard Martin was born in still stood against the wall, and Grandmother Eloise's wardrobe was in the corner.
I hung my clothes in it and headed back down the stairs for that drink and conversation with my mother.
We spent the cocktail hour catching up, and over dinner we discussed my new career.
I had been back home only once since I got my real estate license less than two months ago -- for the July 4th family picnic -- but at that point everything had been so new that I'd had very little to say about it.
I was more forthcoming this time.
"It's a nice place to work.
I'm glad my friend Lila suggested it, and not only because it's so convenient to my apartment.
Walker is very professional and knowledgeable -- there are rumors that the governor is considering him for a spot on the real estate commission next year -- and most of the others are decent and helpful, too.
I'm not making any money yet, but times are tough for everyone, and I'm sure things will get better soon."
"Any personable young men?"
my mother wanted to know.
I snorted and pretended it was a sneeze.
"Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
Any number of them, starting with Walker himself.
He's not that young -- around 45, maybe -- but he's very well off, absolutely gorgeous..."
"Seventeen years isn't so much," Mother murmured.
I smiled. "...and gay.
Tim is a turd, but a very successful turd, and also gorgeous and gay.
As are more than half the other men.
The rest are either married or involved, too young or too old.
Except for James."
"And what's wrong with him?"
Mother asked, resignedly.
I grinned.
"Not a thing.
He's 32 and very handsome.
Makes a good living, owns a condo in Green Hills, and drives a Beamer.
Dresses well and works out regularly.
He's single, straight, has no ex-wives or children, and is looking for the right woman."
"So why aren't you snatching him up?"
Mother asked.
"He's not interested in me," I answered.
"Well, I never...!"
Mother sniffed, insulted on my behalf.
"Whyever not?"
"He's black," I said.
"He wants a black girlfriend."
In fact, I should probably tell Lila Vaughn about him the next time she and I got together for one of our tax-deductable real estate power-lunches.
Not that she was interested in settling down, having just escaped from a much worse marriage than mine, but she was always interested in making the acquaintance of a good-looking man.
If it came to that, I should tell her about Rafe, as well.
"By the way, Mother," I said, toying with my cobbler, "you'll never guess who I ran into the other day."
"Who?"
Mother said suspiciously.
She could tell from my tone that this wasn't likely to be good news.
I told her, and watched her wrinkle her brows.
"Who?"
"Rafe Collier.
Come on, Mother; you can't have forgotten him.
He's three years older than me and you knew his mother slightly.
I think she may have worked some parties here back in the old days."
Mother's immaculately made-up eyes widened a fraction.
"The one who got herself pregnant by the colored boy?"
"The same," I said.
"LaDonna Collier.
And you saw her son?
How did that come about?"
"He called," I said.
"Not me personally; the office.
He wanted to see a house.
I'll tell you all about it later.
When we're finished eating.
I don't want to spoil dessert."
I devoted myself to my cobbler.
Mother subsided.
Later, when we were sitting in the formal parlor, on Great-Aunt Ida's uncomfortable turn-of-the-(last)-century sofa upholstered in peach velvet, I told her the whole story from beginning to end.
Including the part she hadn't heard yet, in which I found the body.
And then I watched her turn pale under the meticulously laid make-up.
"How awful for you, Savannah."
"It wasn't pleasant," I admitted.
"That presumptuous, ill-bred young boor.
To talk to you like that!"
"Not that.
Finding Brenda was awful.
Rafe Collier is merely annoying."
And then some.
"Well, of course, dear.
Naturally, finding a butchered body," she shivered delicately, "couldn't possibly compare to having to deal with young Mr. Collier, rude though he may be.
Still," she lowered her voice, "you think he may have had something to do with it?"
"The police seemed to think so.
Or at least they seemed very interested in him.
Kept him for a long time after they finished with me.
He was there, after all, and he wouldn't be what I'd consider a particularly law-abiding person, I think."
"No," my mother agreed, with a genteel shudder, "I imagine he wouldn't be."
"He went to prison once, didn't he?
Right after he left high school?"
Mother nodded.
"For assault, dear.
Or maybe it was battery."
"Good grief!"
I said.
I had assumed it had been for stealing a car or forging a check or something relatively -- comparatively -- innocent; not something as frighteningly violent as assault and battery.
"What happened?"
"A bar fight, I believe."
Mother clucked.
"He was arrested, of course.
There was no doubt that he was guilty.
It was a particularly brutal beating, from everything I heard at the time.
Practically killed the poor man."
We sat in silence for a moment.
"Do you ever see her?"
I asked.
"LaDonna?"
"Dear me, no," my mother said, smoothing a hand over her impeccably styled, blond hair.
"She was common as dirt, bless her heart.
We didn't associate.
And now she's passed on, of course."
I blinked at her.
"Passed on?
Dead, you mean?"
Mother nodded.
"But she can't have been very old.
If she was only fifteen when Rafe was born, and he's three years older than me..."
I counted rapidly on my fingers, math not being my strong suit, "she'd only be in her mid-forties.
What happened?"
"It was quite a to-do, dear.
I'm surprised you didn't hear about it on the news up there in Nashville."
Mother lowered her voice delicately.
"She died of an overdose of some drug or other.
At home.
By the time someone found her, she had been dead for several days, or maybe as much as a week."
"And nobody went looking for her for all that time?
What about the neighbors?
And where was Rafe?
Didn't she have a job?"
"She worked at the distillery when she was younger," Mother said, referring to the Jack Daniels whiskey distillery outside Lynchburg, some 45 minutes away, "but she has been collecting disability for at least ten years.
And she lived alone.
There's no telling how long she was lying there.
She might have called out, but if she did, no one heard her.
The Bog is mostly empty these days, and I haven't seen her son since he went off to prison."
"Did it happen recently?
LaDonna's passing?"
Mother nodded.
"They found her almost two weeks ago now, I'd say.
With the heat and all, it can't have been a pleasant task for poor Bob.
Here, have some brandy, dear; you're as white as a ghost."
She poured some into a glass and handed it to me.
I don't like brandy, but I gulped some anyway.
It burned its way down to my stomach and I coughed.
"Oh, gosh!"
"What's wrong?"
Mother asked, concerned.
