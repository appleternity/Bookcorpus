That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

I am the one who hunted in what your men claimed to be your territory.
I am the reason your man was injured.
Thus, any resolution to this problem, including any consequences for these actions, must start with me."
Come on, Axen.
Get over here.
A grumble rolled across the Krenish men.
Jennik's eyes narrowed, and he slowly drew his sword.
"Choose your words wisely, female.
Or I may do exactly as you request."
Again, the reaction behind me was palpable.
"You would threaten an unarmed woman?"
Thone's tone was respectful but with anger and outrage straining his voice.
Jennik's lip twisted.
"The female said that our problem is with her alone.
Unless you wish to involve your village?"
The Krenish men drew their weapons, looking eager for a fight.
My muscles tightened, my arm longing to reach behind me and draw my sword.
But I didn't have my sword.
Not that it would have done much good against so many enemies.
Still, I felt even more exposed and vulnerable without it.
Axen, where are you?
I can't imagine what it must be like to live with so little awareness of the sky above me.
I glanced up, a subtle, flickering glance.
Greyish clouds obscured the sky, but one patch looked just a bit darker than the others and moved in slow circles above us.
My body relaxed.
I kept my face still to hold back the instinctive smile.
I turned my head slightly to address Thone.
"Tabe-ro, thank you for your defense.
I do not wish to involve your village.
This is my problem to address."
Then I turned back to Jennik's smirking mug.
"You are free to remedy this conflict between us as you best see fit.
But, as your men may have told you, you will first have to address this matter with my guardian."
Axen dropped from the clouds with a piercing roar, circling above the Krenish men.
Half of them all but dropped their weapons to cover their ears and cower, shouting in alarm.
Even Jennik took a step back, cringing away from the sky.
Behind me, women screamed and rushed into buildings, dragging curious children with them.
The men didn't follow, but I had a feeling they responded with as much fear as the Krenish men.
It was natural.
The right way a person should respond to the appearance of a dragon.
Axen circled one more time, then dipped lower toward the road behind me.
The Emsha men scattered to the side, and she landed where they had been standing with a ground-shaking thud.
Most of the Krenish men lost their balance and fell as the ground rocked.
Many of them didn't try to stand back up.
She spread her wings in a threatening manner, hissing steam toward my would-be attackers, weaving her neck back and forth like a snake while keeping her keen gaze fixed on the men.
Bit of an overly dramatic entrance, don't you think?
With an overly dramatic introduction like that, how else could I have entered? she retorted.
I bit back another smile and addressed Jennik, back to my exceptionally polite voice.
"May I introduce my guardian, Axen.
If you have a problem with my behavior, she is happy to discuss the matter with you."
Jennik had managed to keep his feet through all this, but he was several paces further away from me now than he had been before Axen made her appearance.
He was crouched, one hand down toward the ground for balance and the other holding his sword sideways between himself and the dragon.
The tip only shook a little.
His face twitched a couple of times before he spoke.
"Thone!
Is this what your village's 'honor' has come to?
You hide behind a female and a monster, leaving them to handle your problems?
You coward!"
I hadn't expected that Thone would respond.
I'd assumed he would have run inside when Axen landed.
The man deserved a lot more credit than I kept giving him.
He stepped out from where he'd taken cover beside the inn, though he still kept an eye on his distance from Axen, and addressed Jennik.
Polite.
Careful with his wording.
And... did I hear a note of amusement in his voice?
"From what I heard, tabe-ro, the lady is correct.
She is the one who shot the rekin, and it was her guardian that injured your man.
Your quarrel is technically with her, not with us.
I'm not hiding anything.
It is simply not my business to interfere."
Jennik's expression darkened further.
I pushed, just a nudge.
"Did you still wish to discuss the terms of consequences?"
Perhaps I'd overplayed the innocent tone, but I didn't care.
"Because my guardian is prepared to address the issue."
Axen blew out another snort of steam, just a touch hotter this time.
Yelping, the Krenish men shielded their faces from the blast.
Jennik, to his credit, only lifted a hand to fend off the heat, his head barely tilting away, unlike the cowering men behind him.
His eyes fixed on me, searing with rage and hatred.
Sectarian men hated nothing more than being shown up.
My being a female made it that much worse.
He snarled, then shouted a command.
The whole group spun and retreated, vanishing quickly down the tree-canopied road.
I relaxed, finally letting my arms drop back into a more natural position at my sides.
Axen snuffled in amusement.
Aww, and I wanted to chat with them.
We could have had tea and cookies.
I rolled my eyes and turned to face her.
A few Emsha men stepping out from the cover they'd taken caught my attention instead.
Thone and Rik looked almost as amused as Axen, but others glared between her and me, displeased with the massive creature blocking the road.
Erret stomped forward, but stopped short when Axen looked curiously at the approaching Elf.
He scowled and jabbed a finger at me while backpedaling a couple of steps.
"Take your... your abomination and get out of our village!"
What an unpleasant little thing.
Would you like me to eat it?
No, Axen.
A couple other men chimed in their agreement from a safe distance.
I raised my hands in a peaceful gesture.
"Of course.
We're leaving.
I apologize for the trouble I've caused."
I turned and walked toward the inn.
I'd have to send Axen into the forest while I gathered my things so she didn't upset the villagers any further.
"Thone!"
Tarvia flew out of the inn, her eyes wild with panic.
"I can't find Fasha!
She's gone!"
Distracted, I slowed.
"I'm sure she's here in the village, just in a friend's house," Thone soothed, pulling his wife close.
His glance my direction was probably intended to be subtle.
"As soon as things are safe, we'll find her."
Right.
My cue to leave.
I picked up the pace again.
Axen, I need you to...
"She went to play in the forest," a gangly teen boy said.
"I saw her earlier."
Tarvia and Thone both spun to look at the road the Krenish men had vanished down.
Thone's face looked paler than usual.
"We'll go," Thone said, biting each word.
"We'll bring her--" A child's scream echoed from further down the road than I could see, sending ice down my back.
Axen responded to my alarm with an adrenaline surge of her own.
She dropped her head to my side, her ear near the ground.
I caught one of the larger horns at the crest of her skull.
She swung her head upward with a neat flick, dropping me into place at the top of her neck.
I found my grip on her scale ridges as she leapt into the air.
Wind snapped my braid from side to side and tried to sting my eyes, but my focus was downward at the road I could barely see between the trees, searching for signs of movement.
Nothing, nothing...
There.
Many bodies raced along the road toward Krenish.
The trees were too thick for Axen to land, but I spotted a clearer area not far ahead.
There.
That's the place.
She snuffed in acknowledgement.
A loud horn call cut through the howl of wind in my ears, coming from just below us.
An answering call came from within the city ahead.
I peered ahead and saw activity.
Jennik was calling for reinforcements.
I shoved myself upright and climbed down her neck toward the dual ridges of plates forming a V down the length of her back to her tail.
Get to the city.
Keep the reinforcements from reaching Jennik's group.
She snuffed again, adjusting her pace.
I'd have to reach her tail by the time she reached the approaching clearing, or I'd be tumbling through trees.
My foot hit one of the plates.
I immediately spun and dropped flat on my back, sliding along the one place where her scales were smooth enough to allow such a thing.
She bucked her shoulders as I passed, giving me a quick speed boost.
As I reached the base of her tail, it dipped toward the ground.
We'd reached the clearing too soon.
I curled into a ball and let gravity take its course along the steep slope of her tail.
When I reached the very end, she flicked upward just slightly to cushion my landing.
