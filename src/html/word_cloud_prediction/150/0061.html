This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Drifta tucked it inside his vest then swung himself down the lines and stood on the wreck, securing himself to the netting.
With both hands free he could attach the amplifier to the battered shell.
"Anyone getting this?"
he asked through the mouthpiece.
"Can you hear me?"
"Anything?"
called Gazillia from the Moonstruck rails.
"Shush," said Drifta, with a wave of his hand at the impatient captain.
"I need to concentrate."
Drifta heard sounds, but they could have been just the wreck as it bounced into the Moonstruck or just the spaceship in her death-throes.
Then he heard a female voice, weak as if from someone wounded or very sick, the sounds too indistinct to make out.
He played with the controls of the amplifier for a better signal, hoping the equipment could receive the replies through the shell of the ship.
"I...I...help...me."
The voice was faint as if spoken by someone on their deathbed.
"We'll get you out."
"NO!"
The voice was forced by somebody determined to be heard at all costs.
"What is killing me could kill you all."
Drifta took a deep breath.
"Thanks for that."
He looked up at the faces above him, all awaiting answers.
"This could take awhile."
Settling down as best as he could he adjusted the earphones.
"Tell me what I need to know.
The short version."
Chapter 14
Drifta closed his eyes and listened as he clung to the nets draped about the wreck.
A being in the dead ship struggled to tell her sorry tale, pausing often to gather the strength to continue.
Then she faded.
"Right.
I got that. Just...hang on.
I'll sort something out. Hey. Hey.
Are you hearing me?"
A gasp, then, "You can't...nobody must enter.
Contagious."
"I'll not let you die.
Give me a little time."
Drifta clambered up the lines and dropped on the deck, the crew staring at him as they waited for news.
"You want the bad news or really bad news?"
"All of it," said Gazillia, folding his arms and glaring at Drifta with growing impatience.
"Right.
Only one survivor barely clinging to life.
Fifteen others dead.
Anyone exposed to what killed them will die and not in a nice way."
Orlador swapped glances with Gazillia then asked, "Anything on there can we use?"
It may have sounded mercenary but without repairs to the Moonstruck, neither ship was going anywhere.
"Ah.
The one bit of good news. Yes.
Maybe.
I think so.
Not exactly a plug in and go, but with a couple of modifications it might get us home."
"So open it up and get the parts," said Gazillia.
"Have you forgotten the we all die if we go inside part already?"
asked Drifta.
"Not if wearing a diving suit you," said Orlador.
"Me?
I don't recall volunteering."
"I order, so you do," snapped Orlador.
Already one of the crew was running back with a diving suit and he offered it to Drifta.
Unhappy at having the responsibility foisted on his shoulders, Drifta growled, "Wrong size and not my colour."
Ignoring that excuse, Gazillia said, "Can't help up here, you.
Go inside must you."
"Inside must I, hey?"
With a sigh and thinking of the dying woman he had made a promise too, Drifta pulled on the suit and checked the air through the helmet gauge before locking it in place.
"I'll need cutting gear and a safety line."
They were swiftly brought and he was back climbing over the wreck.
He used the radio amplifier to convey his intention to the woman of cutting his way into the wreck.
"But...you will spread the disease."
"I'll only catch it if I take the helmet off and that's not happening.
I'm cutting the hole in the ship.
Stand back."
Drifta arced the plasma cutting tip on the hull and sliced through the alloy shell.
Thirteen minutes later he had an opening large enough to climb through which he did, taking care not to rip the suit on the edges.
Only one half-dead human was in that cramped space, slumped back in a heap.
She was in a bad way and close to death.
"I have water and food," said Drifta, sitting by her side.
She took the water and drank it down.
"The others?"
"Down below.
You do not want to see them."
'Fair enough.
I'm Drifta."
"I'm Voloxdra Nur'jostal."
"Isn't that a Jorgonian name?"
"Yes.
Call me Volox."
"Pleased to meet you, Volox.
You can tell me what happened later.
I need spare parts or nobody is going anywhere."
He explained what he needed and she told him where to find them.
"Seriously?"
he moaned.
"Right at the bottom of this thing?"
A laugh, more or less.
"I never said it would...be...easy."
With hardly the strength to raise her hand, she pointed at a bank of emergency sensors.
Drifta touched the only one still dimly glowing and the schematics of the whole ship lit up.
Volox thumped the floor beneath her.
"Through the hatch, then along the passage then through another hatch then..."
Drifta knew she was fading fast.
"Basically, through the dead bodies until the end and I win a prize."
"Have fun with that.
There's a toolkit down there."
Drifta pressed a green sensor light and the hatch hissed open.
His stomach was already churning before he had even entered the main body of the ship full of dead people.
He paused on the lip of the hatch before dropping through and looked at Volox, so sickly and pale with repulsive growths on her face, wondering if she'd be alive when he returned.
Her downcast eyes were dull and empty, vomit dried on her tunic, hands limp at her side.
Steeling himself, he dropped down and something crunched and gave way beneath sinking into something spongy and soft.
Daring to look at what he'd stood on, the body could have been either male or female.
He had landed on the ribcage and it had collapsed under his weight.
"Sorry, friend."
This was the flight-deck and it looked like they had gathered here to die together, only Volox having the strength to extricate herself from the others.
Drifta could only imagine what the stench would be like had he been suicidal enough to remove his helmet.
He had a job to do.
Along a passage, down a ramp and through another hatch.
Only his helmet light dimly lit the way, and he was grateful for that as he brushed past another corpse.
From the schematics he'd seen he knew where he had to go and using his helmet light he pulled off two covers to see his goal.
Not an easy job on his own but he didn't have the luxury of a helping hand.
He found the tools in a storage locker and with his natural practical ability he took the units apart to salvage what he needed.
Twenty minutes later he was done.
Making his way through the ship of corpses he dragged himself through the hatch, kicking it shut as if shutting out the revolting images now etched on his mind.
"Did you get the parts?"
Volox gasped.
"Yes.
Our engineer will make it work."
"Then take them and cut this coffin free to sink out of harms way."
Drifta knew that made sense on some basic level.
"I'll take the parts, but I'll be right back."
In his gloved hand he grasped her hand, small and without grip of any strength.
He almost said he would not let her die alone, but stopped himself.
"We need to find out what happened here.
I'll be back in a few minutes."
Drifta climbed outside and pulled himself over the nets to the deck of the Moonstruck where he was hosed down as a precaution.
"I got what I could.
I hope it's enough."
"Yes, with some modifications," said Gazillia, grabbing the parts.
His engineer scurried off with them to perform mechanical magic.
Gazillia looked up at the much taller Drifta, who had removed his helmet to drink water.
"In there?"
he asked with a nod at the wreck.
"Dead bodies all over the place.
Only one female called Volox alive.
She'll be dead soon."
"This salvage need we.
Get rid of the dead.
Let the fish eat them."
"Volox isn't dead.
Captain.
We must find out what the crud happened.
Get this ship repaired and I'll go back in there to get to the bottom of this.
