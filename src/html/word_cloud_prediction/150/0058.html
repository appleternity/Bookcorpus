There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

You call me, you find someone a little younger."
The fat man laughed at Frank's solemn face as he stood up to leave.
"Is there a report to be filed?"
Maggie insisted.
"Oh, I'll report something for you.
We ain't exactly fools down here, young lady."
The Pastor shrugged his shoulders as the official drove away.
"I thought he'd do all kinds of tests and hold up our work," said Frank.
"I wouldn't worry about it," said the Pastor.
"He's got money in Jake's project just like most everyone else in town.
He wouldn't do anything that might hurt the profits.
He's got reason enough, though.
He hates Jake, I can tell you that."
"Why?"
"His daughter died in childbirth on her sixteenth birthday.
Died right in his arms.
Most people in town knew Jake was the father.
Jake didn't even show up at the hospital or the funeral.
There got to be so much bad talk about Jake, Mister Terment invited Doc Bayne to Peachblossom.
Way I heard it, Mister Terment asked him to help stop the rumors about Jake and the daughter.
The Doc wouldn't sit down.
He stood there and said to him, 'You pack that boy of yours in a box and put him under six feet of Eastern Shore earth next to my dead girl and her baby and maybe that'll stop the rumors, Mister Terment.'"
Another car approached the farmhouse.
They could see its roof above the hedges of honeysuckle, then flashes bouncing off the metal as it passed behind the boxwoods.
"It's a car like yours, Maggie.
A state car."
"That's my boss," said Maggie.
She and Frank stood up from the test pit and started towards the farmhouse.
The car stopped and a well dressed woman got out and waved to Maggie.
"Hi, Cathy."
"Hello, Maggie.
I thought it was hot in Baltimore, but, oh my, the humidity here in River Sunday.
This is terrible."
Cathy was a tall lanky woman, dressed in summer white.
As they talked, Cathy changed her heels to a pair of low leather shoes.
She opened the car door and put her suit coat on a hook in the back of the car.
On the back seat Frank saw boxes of files he guessed were records of other sites.
"You're making the rounds today?"
said Maggie.
"Same story, Maggie.
Too many projects, not enough money, and I'm supposed to see everyone of them every week.
It's been a bad day."
The two women did not look anything alike.
Maggie was shorter, tanned with her hair tied up carelessly.
Cathy's suit was carefully pressed, her blouse without wrinkles even in the intense heat.
Maggie wore a dirty white tee shirt like the Pastor and Frank and her cutoffs were uneven and ragged.
Cathy kept her polished shoes carefully out of the wet earth as she walked across the field, following behind a barefoot and unconcerned Maggie.
"You certainly get into your work," said Cathy, noticing Maggie's appearance.
Maggie looked back at Cathy, "You didn't hire me to look good on a site, Cathy."
"No, but you're a state employee.
You should remember it.
Remember the taxpayer and his or her opinion of the government employee."
"You are really upset about my appearance aren't you?"
said Maggie, trying not to smile.
"Can we take a look at the site?"
"Yes, of course, Maggie."
"We found a cannon and a skeleton."
"Oh.
I'm sure you're handling it well as usual."
Cathy's attention shifted.
"I must say hello to Pastor Allingham."
She smiled at the Pastor, who stood up from his work to greet her.
"How are you, Mrs. Smith?
It's nice to talk to you again," said the Pastor, shaking hands.
Cathy spoke with a wide, very friendly smile, "I hope you are enjoying your volunteer work.
The Governor wanted me to send his regards."
"Well, that's very kind of him.
Yes, I am enjoying my work here."
Frank was walking behind them.
Cathy turned to him.
"You must be Doctor Frank Light."
She held out her hand.
Frank wiped his hand on his shorts and extended it to her.
"Sorry.
A little dirty," he said as they shook hands.
"I got a call from Jake Terment recommending you for this job, Doctor Light."
"Yes," said Frank.
"Well, what do you think of him?"
"Kind of impressive man," said Frank.
"I should say so.
I think this is a good idea, don't you, Doctor Light?
An expert like yourself can really help.
We are so shorthanded."
"Sure."
"Of course, Jake Terment will do all that has to be done.
After all, his family has lived here for centuries.
We're fortunate that the site of the old wreck was on his land.
I'd much rather work with a landowner whose family has a record of caring about historic things.
Why, that monument in the harbor alone.
That monument is a testimony to the Terment family dedication to River Sunday and its history."
"Jake Terment is all the time pushing to get us finished, Cathy," said Maggie.
"I'm not sure he is very interested."
"Maybe if you had as much money at stake," replied Cathy, "You might feel the same way.
Anyway, I'm sure he'll do the right thing on this site.
I'd like to see your notes."
Maggie handed over her work journals.
Cathy looked at them quickly and gave them back.
Then Cathy walked slowly around the site, lips pressed together.
Frank and the Pastor watched the two women.
"When the sunlight hits her hair a certain way, Maggie reminds me of a girl I knew a long time ago in Australia," said Frank.
"There's not a lot of women like her in this world," said the Pastor.
Cathy stopped and began to talk to Maggie.
"Can you finish up, be back at the office tomorrow?"
"Finish up, no.
I can be back in the office but then I'll have to return here."
"I don't want to have to send you back again.
What do you have left to do, Maggie?"
"We want to try to find some more of the ship.
We still don't understand enough about it."
Cathy leaned over to Maggie.
Frank and the Pastor could hear what she was saying even though her voice was lowered.
"The Pastor, is he happy?
Are you taking care of him as I asked you to?
For God's sake, don't let him work too hard in this sun.
I don't want the office blamed for a black preacher having a heart attack."
"He seems to be enjoying the work," said Maggie.
"These graves he talks about, any sign of them?"
"We found a skeleton, but it's not one of the old slaves.
It was a white man."
"Well, let him look all he wants," said Cathy.
"Don't get the office involved in the slave graveyard business."
"What if we find the graves?"
"You still don't get it, do you, Maggie?"
"Maybe I don't."
"Well, let me explain it to you," said Cathy, staring at her.
"You are a state employee in one of the smallest departments in the bureaucracy.
A nice dedicated professional department which doesn't have enough budget, has to fight the other more needy programs in the legislature every year to get the budget to keep you and a few other professionals paid."
"You get paid too, Cathy," Maggie added.
Cathy went on without replying, "We have to keep the department going, Maggie.
We have to try to do a reasonable job for the people who care that our work is done correctly and we also have to try to keep the department budget.
So, don't get nervous in the service.
When I tell you to get a job done and get back to the office, you listen to me and do as I say.
Believe me, there's a lot has to be done to keep you working."
She grinned, "Just think how much it would cost to move all the graves in a slave graveyard to some other site.
A lot of that cost would come from our budget, and take funds away from other projects.
Do you want that?"
"I've always been a professional," said Maggie, moving from foot to foot.
"Maggie," she said as she lowered her voice even more, "The Governor gives me my orders.
On this job he said to please the preacher and to please the businessman.
That's all he said but I knew he meant that both these men were very powerful and could cause him a lot of adverse political pressure.
He expects to hear no complaints from Jake or the Pastor.
As I see it, the best way to please both of them as well as the Governor is to have you both do as little investigating as possible here and to cover this site soon with tons of impermeable concrete."
She gave Maggie an understanding smile.
"I've always tried to help the people who work for me.
I keep you protected from the politics so you can do your job.
This site might become very controversial if you archeologists find anything out of the ordinary.
So, in order to please everyone, I find it useful not to care what is here.
Frankly, I don't want you to find anything at all."
She winked at Maggie.
"I'm sure you'll do the right thing here."
