The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

It was always handy to have visual evidence to back you up, if there was ever a problem, but even he hadn't envisaged something like this happening, and by the time I arrived at the roundabout Doc Martin and several of the other Doctors from the Centro Salud, including Doctora Botella were working on Inma, but her mother was covered with a sheet.
The Ayuntamiento (Town Hall) had recently constructed a roundabout at the bottom of our drive, as a sort of thank you for all the things that I was doing around the Pueblo, but obviously the very elderly gentleman who delivered to the ferreteria (hardware store) had never come across it before.
He had been going too fast, and his load had not been secured properly so when he suddenly found himself running out of road he did a double swerve, the first one loosened a pile of scaffolding poles in the back, and the second one catapulted them off the lorry, and into Inma and her mother.
Her mother had died instantaneously, and but for Doc Martin and the other Medico's Inma would have quickly followed.
One scaffolding pole had slammed into the small of her back and another one had caught the back of her head.
She was in a mess but fortunately the Cruz Roja (Red Cross) helicopter was in the air, returning from another emergency, so after dropping its medics off it quickly went and topped up its tank at El Campo, and then came back and landed beside the roundabout.
Inma was gently loaded into the machine, and then it was swiftly on its way to the nearby hospital, along with Doc's Martin and Botella.
A few minutes later, as I sadly watched the crew carefully lift Inma's mother into the back of their Ambulance, a Guardia Civil Officer started asking about 'next of kin' details, and all eyes turned to me, and I realised that I, and all at El Campo were now Inma's next of kin, apparently she now had no one else.
Thomas, Carlos's deputy stepped in and took over, his wife's mother had recently passed away so he knew the routine, and he also realised that what happened to Inma's mothers earthly remains now, those important final hours, would be lost to Inma, she was unconscious, and likely to be so for some considerable time, so he sorted out the Guardia Civil Officers, and instructed the Ambulance Paramedics to use a local undertaker for Inma's mother, and then he took out his mobile and rang his brother-in-law; he was the Pueblo's foremost photographer.
A few hours later I visited the hospital where Inma was, and it certainly bought back some vivid memories for me.
As I sat there with Caroline, she was brought out of theatre, she was alive but still in a critical condition, and if she survived at all it was clear to the surgeons that she would never walk again, so I contacted my old team at the Hospital (that thought it was a hotel) and gave them some very explicit instructions.
Over the next few weeks it would be text book co-operation between the public and private sectors, or else.
I hadn't realised it but Inma was one of my 'founder members', and as such she was someone very special to me, we had been through a lot together but we always came out of the other side with smiles on our faces, she had that sort of effect on everyone, so I made it perfectly clear to all and sundry that Inma had medical cover like no one else had ever had; she was their number one priority.
Two weeks later Inma, although still very poorly, was now off the critical list, and her medication was slowly being reduced, just enough so that she could be told about her mother.
Her friends had quickly arranged an around the clock bed watch for her, this after all was Spain, but somehow she was still unaware of her mother's demise, that, apparently was going to be left to me to tell her, and I was not looking forward to it in the slightest.
It must have been how Maria, Caroline and I walked in, because she picked up on something and immediately started sobbing.
I took her hand and tried to break the news to her as gently as I could but she was beside herself with grief, until Thomas came to my rescue.
His brother-in-law had, immediately after Thomas's phone call, started recording everything that happened to her mother on his video camera, everything that Inma should have been involved in was recorded for her to watch, the preparation of her mother's body, the all-night vigil at the funeral directors, and the funeral procession.
I swore to her that I had nothing to do with the turnout on her mother's final earthly journey, yes I was there, but I was swallowed up in the crowds.
San Miguel del Mar came to a standstill for her mother.
Inma had never realised that San Miguellians now held her mother in such high esteem; she had definitely worked off the stigma of being a single parent.
Thomas's brother-in-law had utilised footage from El Campo's security discs (not the gory bits), and at least two other cameramen, to professionally edit it all onto two discs, one lasting about ten minutes, the other lasting two hours.
I held Inma's hand as we watched the expurgated ten minute version on a wide screen television, she of course cried all the way through it but at the end she was smiling as well, which is a very hard thing to do.
One good thing about Inma's situation was that I had been there only three years before, perhaps not exactly the same but close enough to understand how she was feeling, so I sat there and let her pour out all of her grief, troubles, and worst nightmares, it had to all come out, and so I decided to be there for her, as Alice and Robin had been there for me.
Maria and Caroline aided me and the three of us spent the whole night just talking to her, and being there for her.
We watched the short video over and over again, and finally it sank into her that she really wasn't all alone, and so by breakfast-time she was over the worst of her grief, and as we left her in the capable hands of one of my other maids, Carla, we even got a kiss and a smile.
All that we had had during the night were cat naps and endless cups of coffee, so when I got back to Mi Casa it was straight to bed, but at one o'clock I was woken up by my phone jangling away on the bedside table, it was Vicente, and he needed to see me urgently.
It really wasn't Inma's time at all; as we had been consoling her last evening 'person or persons unknown' had broken into her and her mother's apartment and totally and utterly trashed it, there was virtually nothing left in one piece, but why was Vicente involved.
The 'Police Local' had routinely contacted Carlos as the representative of her employer, and he had contacted Vicente, not because of the trashing, that really was a police matter, but because of a letter that Carlos and Pierre had found when they visited the scene of wonton destruction a little later on.
One of the few things that had conveniently survived was a letter from Inma's mothers' landlord, giving Inma thirty days to vacate the apartment.
The lease was in her mothers' name and there was a 'no right of succession' clause in it.
Of course Vicente scrutinized the lease but it was watertight, although he still managed to put the fear of god in the landlord, he may have gotten away with this 'eviction', but never again, Vicente arranged for a company of Private Investigators to go through the landlords holding like a dose of salts.
By three o'clock I was up, abluted, dressed, fed and sitting at the head of my conference table, I had called an emergency meeting of the 'A' team.
Maria, David, Caroline, Carol, Mrs Blake, Eddy, Teddy and Marcel studied the only item on the agenda - Inma.
Now was the time for positive thinking, and by six o'clock I had Inma's new contract in front of me.
Everyone agreed that she was genuinely wasted as a maid, and that she would definitely be more suited to the position of Deputy Housekeeper (Mrs Blake suggested that), and Chief Purser when I was embarked on the Lady S (Carol suggested that).
She would now qualify for a specially adapted company car (Caroline suggested that), and should be allocated the use of one of the Senior Staff suites (David suggested that), or one of my apartments in San Miguel (I suggested that).
Both the suite and apartment should be adapted for wheel chair use (Eddy suggested that), and that 'I' should look into a 'wheelchair adaptable' aircraft (Teddy suggested that), and that a special hamper of her favourite foods should be taken into the hospital (Maria suggested that, but Marcel went off to assemble it).
I had not been too worried when Carol had suggested that Inma take on the Chief Pursers position on the Lady S, all decks above the waterline were 'wheelchair friendly'.
Eight o'clock that evening I was back in Inma's room, she'd had a fairly comfortable day considering the news that she'd had from me the previous evening, and of course she now knew all about the apartment as the Police Local had been to see her, briefly, but I could see that she was building up for another teary session.
I sat down and held her hand, asked her how her day had been, and she promptly burst into tears, I seemed to be having that effect on people lately.
When I could get a word in edgeways I asked her what, apart from her mother, were the tears about.
'How about being homeless and out of a job for starters' she moaned, she was definitely in 'self-pitying' mode.
'Why are you out of a job?'
I asked.
'What use is a paraplegic house maid to you' she bleated out, but there was a bit of the old fire returning and she knew me well enough by now to know that I had something up my sleeve.
'That's quite right' I said, 'but I haven't got one'.
'So you've sacked me already have you' she snapped back (she was definitely out of her 'self-pitying' mode now).
'Why on earth would I want to sack my Deputy Housekeeper?'
I said, and plonked an envelope in her hand.
She opened it, read the enclosed contract, and burst into tears again; I really will have to work on my people skills.
We chatted about her new positions for a little while, until fortuitously a consultant came a visiting, he must have heard that I was in town.
'The prognosis please' I asked (patient confidentiality goes out of the window when you pay the bills).
Inma was making a remarkable recovery, the swelling had now gone down in her brain, but she was right, she would be a paraplegic, although with a little help from a small machine she would hopefully have normal bowel movements (TMI, TMI {too much information}), so no little accidents.
Within the next couple of weeks she should be off to my old hospital for some serious rehabilitation (by helicopter of course), which would, with luck, take about three or four months.
She should then be able to return to El Campo, hopefully in time for Christmas, although it would still be a further few months before she would be ready to start her new roles full time, he had obviously never met Inma before.
I think that I left her in a better frame of mind than when I arrived, so I made my weary way down to the entrance of the hospital, with James traipsing along behind me, to try and find Russell, not that I usually had any trouble finding Russell, I just had to find the nearest 'no parking' zone.
Russell seemed to appear overnight, one minute he wasn't there, the next he had always been there; he had been one of Paul's finds.
A year or so before he had received my fateful phone call at Monastery Housing Association, Paul had been walking through its front office and noticed that a most of the receptionists and Housing Officers were hanging on to their desks for grim death, it wasn't a virus, it was a tenant.
Mr Russell Hobbs, of 25 Ironside Gardens had just been in to ask if there was a garage available for him to rent, not just any old garage mind you, but a very large garage, that could take his Rolls Royce.
Russell's parents had had a wicked sense of humour when they named him, and he frequently wished that they had both been put down at his birth.
Following a very traumatic childhood he joined the Army, but that was even worse than the school playground, so as soon as he could he left, but with a driving licence and several specialist driving courses under his belt, and quickly obtained a position as His Lordship's driver, and as His Lordship only ever called him Hobbs he was quite happy with the situation, and this carried on for many a fine year, until a new maid arrived.
His Lordship took one look at her attributes and promptly had a heart attack.
In his will he left Russell, sorry Hobbs, the Rolls, no money for its upkeep mind you, just the Rolls Royce.
Russell had been on the local Housing Associations waiting list for more than enough years so they re-housed him immediately, as his 'tied accommodation' had suddenly become un-tied, when His Lordship expired.
He was allocated a lovely little flat in Ironside Gardens but the Roller was the problem.
Initially he kept it at the local under-takers, but the rent was astronomical, so he started up a business 'doing' weddings and then running the newlyweds to the airport, and he also picked up a few trips to 'posh' do's, and in the beginning he did alright, but the garage rental was slowly but surely eating into his profits.
Eventually, in desperation he thought 'Monastery Housing might have garages to rent, and if they do perhaps they have a large one going spare', so one afternoon, as he was in the neighbourhood, he popped in, he had nothing to lose after all.
As he left the Housing Associations offices the laughter followed him halfway down the street, but he was used to laughter, but when he finally got home there was a car parked outside his block of flats and a 'man from the Association' was ringing his door bell, it was Paul.
He had a disused store room close to Ironside Gardens, 'if they did it up, would he like it?'
Eureka!
'He who laughs last, laughs longest'.
All went well for a year or so but then competition and high overheads slowly put him out of business and he had to go onto Housing Benefit, but that didn't cover the garage rental, and one of the last things that Paul got before he left for Spain was a 'thank you very much' note from the area Housing Officer; Mr Hobbs's garage rent was now in substantial arrears.
After Paul had settled down in Spain, and had a few minutes to spare, he would have a 'chin wag' with David, and on one particular occasion he related this amusing little anecdote to him, finishing with 'it's a pity he's having such a hard time of it, he's a very nice chap really'.
Apparently I then agreed to it, and he was quickly recruited as my chauffer, not just any old chauffer, but a 'defensive driving, aggressive driving, high speed driving, spinning the car round in its own length type of driver'.
His Army training was going to come in handy after all, and his Roller was now in my garage gathering dust, and I wasn't even charging him any rent, more fool me, but there again I did have the bragging rights.
How many other billionaires could say that their chauffeur had his very own 'chauffeur' driven Rolls Royce, even if he did have to drive it himself.(?)
Russ just loved my Maybach 62 (Daimler AG), although in his opinion it was of course not quite as nice as his Roller, but it was pretty close, and as we wound our way back to El Campo, of course by a different route every time I left the hospital, we approached 'that' roundabout and I noticed, in my half asleep state, a demonstration going on outside El Campo's gates, and it seemed to involve everyone that I employed, and their families.
As we slowly entered the throng it became obvious that it was a friendly demonstration.
Word it seemed had gotten out about how I had treated Inma, and somebody had wanted to shake me by the hand, and it had sort of snowballed.
I slid the sun roof back and stood up in its opening, and I felt like royalty, or even more important - like a soccer star, everyone seemed to want to give me a 'high five' as I slipped gracefully by.
When I finally arrived at the top of the drive I vacated the Maybach and approached David, 'well' he said 'it looks as though it's official now, you can walk on water', obviously they all approved of my style of management.
I sneaked a quick glance at my Rolex, it was nearly eleven o'clock at night, so what do you do with a crowd this size (it seemed like the five thousand), obviously you have to feed them, so I searched the crowd for a patch of white, the kitchen staff, found it, and there he was - Marcel.
I wondered if he would remember the training exercise that I'd had with him a little while ago?
So I held up my hand for a bit of hush, and as the decibels subsided slightly I shouted 'MARCEL - WHAT TIME IS IT?'
A look of puzzlement momentarily came over his face, and then he flung his arms in the air and shouted back, in his best Australian accent, 'IT'S BARBY TIME'.
Out came the loaves, fishes, steaks, beef burgers, chicken bit and pieces and everything else that goes towards having a midnight 'barby', and an hour later I was stood there in my bra, panties and fish net stockings (they were imprinted on the front of my apron, someone was definitely going to be out of a job manana) dishing out the 'scran' with John.
Not only had I inherited Topsy with three of my aircraft, I had also inherited his barbeque.
He had 'found' a 45 gallon oil drum, cut it in half and converted it into a Barbecue; it was basic, but perfect, and it turned out to be much more popular than the gas barby's, the charcoal barby's, and the spit roaster that were also mass producing goodies, it might just have had something to do with all the added flavouring that had congealed on the grill over the years, then around one-thirty, after I had converted the heathen masses to barbequed bananas', (place whole bananas on the grill, and turn frequently.
When the skins start to bubble, split along their length with a fork.
Slowly mush the insides with a tea spoon until perfect, and then pour the tipple of the consumers' choice over it (or insert chocolate buttons in it for the womenfolk).
Serve with squirty cream, eat, and you are now ready to meet your maker), I went 'walkabout', first I watched Natasha trying to teach a group of teenagers the 'Cossack dance', then I joined in a sing along, in about four different languages, with one the permanent crew of the Lady S, who was doing a 'fair to middling' job at throttling a 'squeeze box', and then without any warning whatsoever it happened; I heard a spine chilling scream, followed by an evil, satanic laugh.
This was the Country that had bull fighting as family entertainment so as I rushed towards the crowded table from whence these evil sounds were emanating, my imagination was well into overdrive.
I barged my way to the front of that heaving mass of humanity, but I was too late, my worst nightmares were realised - Topsy had introduced uckers to the masses.

Chapter 12
When I said that I had nineteen Hawker Hunters, I lied (I am getting good at crossing my fingers); I had nineteen and a quarter, and early in September, after a consolation 'Med' cruise on the Lady S I stood with my pilots, ground crew and a smattering of other interested parties outside of 'Yankee' hangar.
As we all gazed on, a lorry was escorted from the main gate, and the poor driver was terrified, 'what ever had he done' he thought.
As he pulled up Topsy and a crew swept in and a crane lifted the container off the flatbed trailer and lowered it gently to the ground.
Topsy then flung open the end doors and just inside we could make out the gleaming nose of a Mark 6D Hawker Hunter.
-------------------- Just before my cut short Caribbean cruise, I had been summoned by the Civil Aviation Authority to CAA House, Kingsway, in London - apparently I was a very naughty boy.
I was blithely converting a shed load of different marks of Hunters to my own personal sub-specification, and as all my aircraft were to have UK registration this was not allowed, not without their permission anyway, enter their grey suits.
After two days of haggling they finally created two new variants of Hawker Hunter, the Mark 6D for the single seaters (I couldn't call them 'F' (for fighter) as they now had no guns), and the Mark 7D for the two seaters, as all the different variants that I had collected would be de-Navalised and/or converted back to the basic F6 and T7 specs, and as all my aircraft would have smoke generators fitted as standard we all agreed on 'D' for 'Display'.
I always knew that we would have to have serious 'CAA' input throughout the whole process of forming the team, but this had been a bit of a surprise, but as it turned out, a rather nice surprise, to date HHA have contracts to refurbish a further five aircraft to the Mk 6D standard for other people (including two for the RAF), after mine are finished of course, and finally, just as we were about to walk out of the door the senior 'grey suit' said 'oh by the way, your request to fly with live ejection seats, it has been approved', just like that.
---------------------- As the nose of the gleaming Mk6D slid out of its box, and into the bright Mediterranean sunshine its new British Racing Green paint scheme glistened (spookily it was actually Hunter Green, the same as the Lady S, as BRG covers a wide spectrum of colours), and the gold lines down either side gave off a lustrous sheen, but those lines finished just before the air intakes.
Why, because my first aircraft had no intakes, or an engine, or wings, or even a tailplane; it was a sawn off static display nose section.
It was the entire front end of an F6, sorry Mk6D, down to the last detail.
The nose undercarriage was complete, and it would go up and down, sorry - retract, for the purists, but in reality the whole thing was really supported by a framework at the rear end.
I had inherited the nose section with one of my aircraft and HHA had quickly realised that it could be very useful indeed.
Whereas it was a bit dodgy to 'willy nilly' drill holes through the skin of a real aeroplane (for example when trial fitting the new glass cockpit), it was ok to do so on this one, any slip of the drill and a bit of poly filler soon made it as good as new.
HHA also used it to proof fit all my new instrumentation and associated black boxes in the new equipment bay, where the gun packs had once been; apart of course for my aircraft, that still had it installed when it arrived at their factory, complete with cannon shells, oops!
They made sure that everything was properly laid out and ventilated in the new 'equipment' bay, and that the new access panels worked as advertised before they even touched a 'real' aeroplane; although the four gun ports, complete with Sabrina's (the four bulging link collectors on the aircrafts sides) would remain, just to make the aircraft look mean (I wonder why they call them Sabrina's?).
When the trials had been successfully concluded I had HHA refurbish it to the Mk6D standard, finishing it as per the other aircraft, connect all the electrical bits up to a rather large computer and voila!
I now had a flight simulator, not like the 'proper' ones, but good enough to train up my pilots on the new glass screen cockpit, and also to teach them how to respect an ejection seat.
The bomb heads at HHA had rigged up a nasty fright for anyone who forgot the correct procedure, no blood but plenty of brown stuff, although the only person that I really felt sorry for was the sign writer, I had 'assigned' Inma as its pilot, and had insisted that her full name was on the side of the fuselage, with Topsy as her plane captain, hopefully it would be a nice surprise for her when she returned to El Campo.
Chalky also wanted his share of it to, to train up his fire crews on ejection seat safety and aircrew rescue in the event of a crash; and I also wanted my share of it to - as a video game, and then two days later I was off with Natasha on a date, not that kind of date, she was young enough to be my daughter, it was to collect the first two modified aircraft, and they were definitely the bee's knees.
As we swept in over El Campo, Natasha glued to my wing tip, I just knew that this was the beginning of something very special.
As the new aircraft started arriving the unmodified ones were quickly sent back to England, but HHA had gained in experience and so we had the 'shed', full of aircraft by the 23rd of December, what a 'crimbo prezzy', and to make it even more special Inma broke a specially prepared bottle of 'champers' over the nose wheel of her very own 'quarter of an aeroplane' to celebrate.
Inma had the sparkle back in her eyes when she returned to El Campo, but it was murder trying to stop her from working.
First off I thought that as she was getting a car then she should first have a driving license - that should slow her down for a while.
It took her ten days.
Then she had to choose a car, but I had forgotten that I had already done that bit (after a chat with her), and it was sat waiting for her in the garage next to Russ's Roller.
I hope she doesn't get them mixed up.
Then suddenly she settled down, in between X and Y hangars - in the ground crew crewroom to be more precise; she voluntarily took over the coffee boat, not that I complained, she made an egg sarnie to die for.
After the Christmas break it was down to serious training for both the aircrew and ground crew alike.
Our first public display was to be at the Farnborough International Air Show on my birthday, the twentieth of May (I don't mind what presents I get, just as long as they are expensive), if we are going to start somewhere, it might as well be at the top.
My converted BAe 146 arrived in February, and it was a bit of everything.
It was a line shack to Topsy, it was a briefing room to Natasha, it was a passenger airliner to the ground crew, and it was an office to Teddy; what was it for me?
I wondered, and why did Teddy want a flying office?
So that he could terrify the aircrew of course.
Zebedee (that was what we named her) had airborne radar and CCTV installed so that he could follow the formations around the sky, they were never very far from his beady eyes.
Early in May I had another visit from HRH and his extended family, I now seemed to be the only person that could get away with entertaining royalty as though they were the next door neighbours popping in for a cup of sugar, I certainly had a lot to thank Major Cummings for - I think.
We all had a relaxing time cruising around the Greek Islands on board the Lady S (the floating one), and Inma never put a foot, sorry wheel wrong, but on the way back from the Islands we stopped off at a deserted beach, not too far from El Campo, and were treated to the first complete display routine of the Green Machines.
Sally, one of the spare pilots was turning out to have the makings of a great commentator, and so she was our Master/Mistress of Ceremonies; and it was a spectacular display, both of them (?).

Chapter 13
My birthday comes around every year, whether I like it or not, but this year I was actually looking forward to it, it was tomorrow, and as I was idly thinking about it, I was flying over the Bay of Biscay with sixteen Hunters and Zebedee following me, and as we neared the English coast Teddy orchestrated our 'arrival' onto the Display Circuit.
I didn't have a lot to do as I was not a professional aerobatics pilot, but I could still hold my own in formation flying so as I approached our destination, on Teddy's mark, I pressed my 'press to transmit' button.
'Farnborough Approach, this is Lady S requesting permission to 'fly by', and then join left hand circuit for landing'.
Either I would get a rollicking for not sticking to strict R/T procedure, or I might just get away with it.
'Lady S, this is Farnborough approach, you are cleared for 'fly by' and left hand circuit to land, by the way are you on your own?'
I had got away with it, 'only a couple of chicks Farnborough approach, will be overhead in three zero seconds out'.
Thirty seconds later I took the centre line down Farnborough's main runway, I was perhaps a little low but hopefully no one would notice, perhaps they would all be too occupied with the eight gleaming Hawker Hunters on either wing tip, and a BAe 146 trying to crawl up my jet pipe.
At Teddy's command I just pressed my stop watch and then carried serenely on, but everyone else went ballistic.
Firstly Zebedee seemed to stop in mid-air and then wheel around and dart for the end of the runway.
She had to disgorge the ground crew before we arrived.
Topsy had paid a flying visit to Farnborough a few days earlier and using a laser beam and an old fashioned tape measure he 'spotted' our marshalling points in green paint, and then as the hand on my stopwatch reached the required number I flipped Lady S on her side and pulled on a few 'g', we had practiced this quite a few times so I knew that sixteen Hunters were now in 'line astern' behind me, but, according to the professionals perhaps a little too close for comfort.
Teddy knew the main runways width to the inch, and as I touched down to the left of the runway Natasha, just behind me touched down in the centre of it, and her number two touched down just behind, and to the right of her; and it was crisply repeated by the remaining fourteen aircraft, and a few thousand aviators started breathing again, and as I lead my team to the dispersal Topsy had everything 'tickerty boo', and it all went like clockwork.
'Red Arrows move over, there are new kids on the block'.
Once on the ground everything was checked and Lady S was led away by the nose to her new resting place, the organisers had persuaded me to let her reside in the static park, where hopefully she would be one of the main attractions.
