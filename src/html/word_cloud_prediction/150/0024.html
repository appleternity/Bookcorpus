Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

"By the way, I heard you through the wall.
I like your explanation."
She smiled at him.
"You shouldn't be painted the bad guy when you're really such a softie.
Me on the other hand, I could play the bad guy."
Angelo was laughing as Greg joined them at the sidewalk.
"Ready for a lot of invasive, nosy, and blatant questions?
Good, 'cause here they come."
"Oh," Angelo said interlacing his fingers with hers.
"We need a code word that means we're ready to go."
"Okay," Rachel agreed readily.
Greg was nodding too.
"Here comes Brick and Bella, hurry up."
"How about sexy legs?
I can work that into a conversation."
"I can't say that," Rachel debated but it was too late Brick and Bella was already within ear shot.
"Nice," Rachel said with one raised eyebrow and a downward slant to her pink lips.
Angelo was still smiling.
"Looks like it's up to me when we go then."
Rachel couldn't fight the smile that curved her lips as she shook her head at him.
"Eileen, I'm so excited to be working for you and your husband," Bella said linking arms with Rachel.
Rachel nodded and allowed Bella to lead her into the party that wrapped around from the front yard to the back.
Brick, Greg and Angelo were handed cold drinks and they started talking sports.
Angelo made sure to stay within eye shot of Rachel.
He wasn't going to leave anything to chance.
He watched her as she was introduced to husbands, wives, daughters and sons.
She was kind to everyone she met and looked overly relieved when Penelope asked her for help.
"Quite a woman you got there," the new addition to their group said.
"I'm Bill, I live next door," he said pointing to the white house to the left.
"Yes, she is," Angelo agreed.
He didn't like the way Bill was watching Rachel.
"Where's your wife, Bill?"
Angelo asked.
Bill wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
His gaze was still trained on Rachel.
"In the kitchen, I'm guessing.
She's an eater.
You know what I'm saying?"
Angelo by reputation alone had never really had anyone dare to show interest in the woman on his arm and he did not like the taste he was getting.
Bill was openly leering at his wife.
"No threats, no violence," Greg said close to Angelo's ear but from the look on Brick's face he'd heard the warning.
"Did Greg tell you that I'm a family therapist, Bill?"
"No, no, he didn't."
Bill waved his hand at Angelo like he was standing in front of the television interrupting the big game.
He mumbled something about wanting to be the corn on the cob and when Angelo looked over at Rachel she was buttering the bowl of corn on the cob.
Angelo exhaled slowly.
"I can tell you why your wife eats."
Bill looked at him then.
"She eats because you aren't man enough for her.
You're not satisfying her in the bedroom or in life.
You don't make her want to be the best she can be.
The poor woman is probably trying to self induce a heart attack."
"William," Greg said in a "be careful" tone.
"Family Therapist Parker, if you please, Greg."
Angelo brushed off Greg's grip on his arm.
"You have kids don't you?
That's why she's staying.
It isn't because she doesn't think she can do better, she can.
It's because of the kids."
Bill's face was so red the ketchup on his plate looked pink in comparison.
"You don't want to lose your wife after the rest of your hair falls out do you?
Step up and be her man.
Don't ogle other women so blatantly it's insulting to your wife and when you ogle mine like you've been doing you're in real danger of losing your teeth."
"Okay, Will, I think all the traveling and beer you drank at home is catching up with you."
Greg pulled him away from Bill, who was gulping air and still soaking in the things he'd been told.
Greg was pissed that was easy to see.
"You seem to care about Eileen.
Am I right?"
"Yes."
"Do you know what happens if you get arrested?
Your picture goes through the system.
Your friends who are looking for you, they find you both.
You hear what I'm saying to you, tough guy?"
Angelo nodded.
"I didn't touch him and according to you I have my Masters in Family Therapy so I'm qualified to hand out some much needed therapy."
"Bill is a loser.
He doesn't need you to tell him that."
"He did, actually.
I think he'll make some changes."
Greg had his hands on his hips and was leaning forward as he spoke.
"This is a good chance you have here and you're blowing it."
"You're saying I can't tell some pervert to stop ogling my wife?"
"It's a free country, Will."
"Well, it ain't that free."
Greg shook his head.
"You're gonna blow this."
Angelo patted Greg on the back.
"Relax, buddy.
Everything is working out just fine."
Angelo smiled though he could see Greg's point.
Living life off the radar was going to be a lot harder than he thought.
He could feel Rachel looking at him so he smiled and waved at her.
"Yeah, okay," he said to Greg.
"I'll do better."
CHAPTER TWELVE Rachel had been asked more times than she had digits to count on about the marriage troubles she was having with William.
She was buttering corn and letting the women yammer without her.
Though she couldn't tune them out completely.
"Well, I just don't know what complicated means, hun, but I would forgive that man for anything.
You know what I'm saying?"
The brunette tossing the salad was saying.
"Is he requiring things you just can't do?
You do seem awfully sweet," Betty-Lou Pine added in and Rachel rolled her eyes.
Penelope put her arm around Rachel's waist.
"Now, I know you're not all over here being rude to our newest neighbor.
Not at my barbeque.
You know I'll kick you out, Betty-Lou, it won't be the first time."
Rachel looked with surprise at Penelope then.
"Mmmhmm I did.
I kicked her out.
She thinks she can shop out of everyone else's grocery cart just because hers is empty?"
Rachel shook her head not quite catching what Penelope was saying but Penelope didn't notice.
"She came over here and said you called her on it.
Betty, trying to catch your husband's eye on the first day here?
I like that about you, honey."
"Thanks."
Rachel smiled.
"I'm not good at faking with people so I just come out and say it.
It's just better that way."
"Amen."
Penelope smiled.
"I am the best cook in this state, you just ask anyone.
I can't wait for you to try my barbeque chicken."
Rachel's mouth was already watering from the smell of it.
"I already love it, Penelope.
You've about got me drooling on this corn."
Penelope laughed triumphantly as she set a large platter of barbeque chicken on the table.
It was like magic the way everyone stopped talking and rushed to line up and fill their plates.
"We're saying grace first and the Parkers get to go first," Penelope said.
"Baby, who is saying grace?"
she asked her husband, Dusty.
He was licking his lips just like everyone else and volunteered himself to pray.
She felt Angelo come up behind her as the prayer started.
He put his arms around her waist and rested his mouth on her shoulder.
A hot shiver danced through her body with the contact.
The rough five o'clock shadow against her sensitive skin was igniting desire within her that she was fighting to control.
She gripped both of her wrists tightening the fold of her arms.
I've been married six years.
This doesn't feel amazing or surprising at all.
I'm so used to this.
Angelo nuzzled her neck.
He knows what he's doing to me.
She realized.
I see how it is.
You wanna play, Angelo?
Rachel tilted her chin upward and turned her face toward him.
She lifted up onto her tiptoes so her lips were against his ear and whispered, "That feels so good, Will.
Mmm, deeply good."
His grip on her waist tightened and she smiled triumphantly, letting her teeth graze his ear as she turned back.
She bowed her head just in time as Dusty said, "Amen."
