Josie was in awe of the ease with which he spoke, all eyes on him, with no fear or nervousness in his tone or his gaze.
"In light of this, we also ask that you not judge us in our efforts, our failings, or our time together.
Like most work, it is best done when shared, as ideas from all involved enhance the quality of the end product.
If you have any questions or concerns, I will be happy to speak with any of you in the yard momentarily.
I give you a good day and thank you for your time and attention."
It was nearly a full minute after he walked back through the church, straight down the aisle again with nary a faltering step, before someone, no, more than one, began to clap.
Several others followed, either in agreement or just as a habit, and soon most of the group was joining this gesture of approval.
Josie and Lucy kept their hands together, their eyes on each other.
"You didn't know, did you?"
Lucy asked, knowing the answer as she did so.
Josie shook her head.
"I don't know what to say.
It was wonderful, and brave, but ..."
"But what?"
"I don't know."
She felt the multitude of eyes on her as she and her mother stood, smiling in response to anyone she caught in her gaze as the two of them walked the same path Arthur had only a few minutes earlier.
She wanted to be available for questions from anyone as well, but she didn't want to interfere in anything that the others wanted to say to him either.
Lucy took her arm as they emerged into the sunlight, directing her to the other side of the yard from where the young man stood, already speaking with a couple of older ladies who looked very serious as they listened to him.
He looked so very businesslike and focused, smiling politely as he answered their questions and explained his plans, and only once did he look over at her and she wasn't sure if he didn't wink to ease her mind.
The two women stood arm in arm for only a few minutes before a small group of women approached them.
All were neighbors, ladies they had known for years, and in Lucy's case, for decades.
They had all sat together at this very church growing up, shared recipes at parish picnics, attended each other's weddings ... watched each other's children grow up and move on.
One of the women looked down as she stood before Lucy and Josie, but the others held their gazes, almost defiantly.
"Well," said one dark-haired woman, a bit older than Lucy and clearly the leader of the pack, so to speak.
Josie knew her to be the type to be more judgmental than most of her mother's acquaintances, and she had never been comfortable around her.
She braced herself for what she predicted would be quite a set down.
She didn't know if she should answer any accusations or just ignore them; in the few moments she waited for the woman to continue to speak, she held her mother's hand tightly in her own, determined to stand firm regardless of whatever approach the woman took.
"It really isn't proper to mix with gentlemen, even if it is for charity.
One must be aware of appearances.
Nice girls really should know better."
Josie had thought she was prepared for whatever the woman might say, but to hear the words out loud, particularly the outright insinuation that she wasn't a 'nice' girl, was too much.
This woman, indeed, all of these women, knew how she had conducted her short life, as well as how her mother had managed hers, and while neither of them were perfect, neither were any of these others, or their own family members.
She felt her mother squeeze her hand and bit her lip to keep from responding.
What could she say to change the woman's mind, after all?
"I see you have no intention of defending yourself.
There really is no defense for such behavior.
I hope you are appropriately ashamed."
"Ashamed of helping others?
I don't understand your reasoning, Missus ... ?"
Arthur had walked softly and quietly up beside the older woman, and Josie couldn't tell how long he had been listening or how much he had heard.
All of the women, including herself, were surprised at his presence, and she watched the woman's cheeks flare red with embarrassment and more than a little fury.
Arthur maintained a polite smile as he looked directly at her, expecting an answer, as was everyone else in the gathering.
Josie noticed that others had followed Arthur to their small group and were listening intently for her judge's response.
The older woman blinked and held her composure, but it took her a few minutes to collect herself enough to speak.
"The shame is in being alone with a man.
Perhaps in your circles it is entirely appropriate, but on our side of town, a young lady must be mindful of the time she spends with the other gender, whether or not the motive and actions are proper.
I am sure you meant no harm, but Miss Warren knows better.
As always, a young lady must be careful of her reputation.
After all, it is all she has."
She ended smugly, settling her shoulders in a manner that seemed to punctuate the end of her statement.
The women about her glanced at each other and nodded almost imperceptibly in agreement, reinforcing their determination to stand by her, as she seemed, for the moment, triumphant.
Arthur seemed nonplussed by her claim and hummed shortly to himself, as if considering her words, before responding.
"Ah, I must disagree.
Miss Warren has much more to offer than a spotless reputation.
She had a strong work ethic, a clever mind, and a kind, Christian heart devoted to the service of the less fortunate.
I think you underestimate her as well as the other young ladies in, as you say, your part of town.
If she had not agreed to spend time with me to work on this project, I would be much farther behind, and the sooner the shelter is up and running, the more of those less fortunate we can help.
I think putting her reputation before the basic needs of others would be rather selfish, don't you?"
At this, the woman stomped her foot.
It was shocking behavior in one of her age, who should have control of her temper, but she had lost her argument, and in a very public fashion, too.
Josie almost felt sorry for her, and said a silent prayer that she would get over her anger and see Arthur's line of reasoning as a rational one rather than continue to make herself upset over it.
Why did the woman care what Josie did anyway?
What business was it of hers?
"Our girls are not yours for the taking, if I may be so bold.
You people with your money and boats and fancy balls think you can take whatever you like whenever you like.
Miss Warren is not something to be had ... she is a person, and you are interfering with her future happiness by toying with her reputation.
Have you no shame?
How can you call yourself a servant for Christ when you besmirch an innocent girl with your actions?"
Josie was stunned as if the woman has slapped her, watching her traipse off in a huff, the other ladies behind her.
She couldn't help but stare in the woman's wake, her thoughts full of the woman's words.
She could hear her mother speaking to her, and others milling about Arthur, reassuring him that they didn't agree with the woman but appreciated his efforts towards helping the poor.
Eventually her mother began to shake her and she noticed that Arthur was in front of her, and the rest of the crowd had backed away, still watching but giving the three of them space and privacy.
She was unsure how this had come to pass.
Her head felt light and she was a little dizzy.
"What is it?"
Arthur was looking at her with great concern, his eyes gentle and questioning, and she could sense that he wanted to reach out and touch her but didn't dare, not in front of everyone.
She wished he would, though, just to hold her hand, but his care for how it would appear to the others, especially in light of what the older woman had just proclaimed in front of the entire church congregation, moved her nearly to tears.
Whatever the woman said, she was wrong, but truly, she meant well, and at the bottom of it, she was obviously worried about the effect the upper class was having on the girls in town.
Josie knew of several girls who had fallen prey to the charms of the young men in question, possibly lured by the promises, said or unsaid, of money, status, and acceptance.
Then again, there had been girls fallen by neighborhood boys as well, so it wasn't necessarily the fault of one social group or another.
Some girls were more susceptible to that sort of attention, and some boys were less scrupulous than others in taking advantage of them.
She shook her head to try to clear the fuzziness from it and looked around for her mother, who was speaking to a few women close beside them.
Arthur was still watching her carefully.
"I'm fine, I'm sorry for being a bit dizzy there.
Must be the heat."
She tried to laugh but she could hear how strained and stilted it sounded.
She longed to be away from these people, the heat, to clear her mind.
It was confusing to think of all that had happened in the last ten minutes or so, from Arthur's surprise appearance in church, to the loud and nearly panicked expression from the older woman, who had seemed only moments ago to be merely a nasty, judgmental creature.
She wanted to be home, with her mother and Arthur, as the denseness of bodies and the heaviness of the heat was keeping her from making sense of it all.
"We should go.
I'll speak with your mother."
She could see, though, that her mother was quite in her element.
She was chatting and smiling, seemingly comfortable with the small crowd around her.
The interest in the shelter was promising, and Josie was glad her mother could field questions and keep the positive flow of interest going, especially as she herself felt paralyzed by the dichotomy of her preconceived notions and the reality of what had occurred just then.
"No," she stopped him from interrupting her mother, considering that Lucy should be allowed to continue as she was, interacting positively with her neighbors, returning their thoughts of her to the good, and either increasing her own reputation as a dependable caregiver or at least maintaining it.
She had been known for so long as an honest and caring nurturer of children and it was a shame that perception had been interrupted, especially on Josie's account.
As long as her mother stayed, though, she had to as well.
She couldn't very well go off with Arthur, alone, as much as she might be tempted to, if only to savor the privacy and the time with him.
They didn't even have to speak for her to feel comfortable.
It was risky and she wouldn't chance it.
While she didn't care too much for her own reputation at this point she did have a care for her mother's.
Arthur, meanwhile, was still standing by her, a bit confused and unsure what to do, but somehow knowing that she needed a few moments to gather herself before deciding what to do next.
"Shall we wait for your mother?
Do you feel ill?
I can get you a glass of water from the church, I'm sure."
Yes, that was it.
He could find her a drink and she would have some time to settle herself, perhaps she would stand by her mother and see if the ladies had any questions she might help answer.
She nodded to him and met his eyes briefly, hopefully reassuring him that all was well.
After he turned to walk into the church, she moved closer to her mother and stood by her side, attempting a small smile in the face of the circle of woman crowded around Lucy.
"Oh, I'm sure that Josie can answer that for you."
Josie drew a blank.
She had heard the voices but was not really paying attention to what was said.
"I'm so sorry, can you repeat the question?"
"Distracted by that handsome young man ... can't say as I blame you.
If I were a few years younger, well."
The ladies tittered but not unkindly.
Josie supposed she had asked for it, but it still made her feel as if they believed she had little to do with the shelter preparations, most likely because they considered her incapable of such a task.
Of course she would have to be led by a man who would tell her what to do step by step.
It was absurd but she wasn't going to argue.
Her actions would speak louder than any words she could use to try to convince them.
"Your question, ma'am?"
she asked politely, her voice firm and steady.
Before the woman could repeat her inquiry, Arthur was at her side with the promised water, and she smiled at him as she took it, sipping at first before draining half the glass as she realized how dry her throat had become.
The ladies became still and watched her and Arthur carefully.
She offered the glass back to Arthur and he made a small, neat bow as he took it from her.
She thought she heard one woman sigh softly.
He was sweet, it was true, and she supposed it was a bit romantic to have him standing there in his fine suit and shoes, practically dancing attendance on her.
She almost giggled but stopped herself.
"Illness.
There is often a great deal of contagion when working with the poor and homeless.
How do you intend to protect yourself and your assistants from catching diseases and passing them along to the rest of the community?"
Arthur could have answered that question but he remained silent, looking at her expectantly.
He was allowing her to be the authority on this one, and she indeed had the perfect answer.
"We have Dr. Edward Colt on board with our team, and he has agreed to advise us as well as spend time at the shelter when his office is closed.
He had drawn up a list of precautionary measures that we fully intend to take, and will keep us well stocked in medical supplies.
We don't want to endanger ourselves or anyone else while helping those who need us.
Every step we take is with the advice of professionals in the fields we must deal with."
"Dr. Colt?"
This declaration met with unanimous approval from the ladies, many of whom had been seen and treated by the very knowledgeable man, and after a few more comments, the group wandered off, grasping hands briefly with Lucy and Josie, smiling and backing away.
Some of the women honestly seemed interested and concerned, but others were merely following the crowd as they always had done.
If the collective turned on the two of them on the morrow, they would join in without question.
It was just a matter of personalities, and some of the women were more easily led and made no effort to judge people and situations on their own merit.
It was a tricky business, judging and not judging, as Josie was just figuring out herself, and she could almost understand the women's reluctance to take on the responsibilities and consequences themselves.
How much easier would it be to follow a designated leader and then blame her if a mistake was made, rather than face the issues that would arise from ostracizing someone because of rumors?
"And now?
Shall we go?
I would be happy to escort the two of you home if you would allow me."
They left, each of them on either side of him, arm in arm, all three relieved that the trial, as it were, was over.
Chapter Eleven Josie slept fitfully, still amazed at the length to which Arthur went to clear her name, stating his business and intentions in front of the entire church and people he knew nothing about.
Ostensibly he could say he did it to elicit their assistance and approval for his shelter, to spread the word so if they knew of anyone in need of help they could recommend the establishment, but she knew that he had also done it, or primarily had done it, in order to clarify his position regarding his time alone with her.
