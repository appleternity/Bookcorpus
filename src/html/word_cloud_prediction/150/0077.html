There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.

Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Funding', 'tfidf': 0.8766364540389983, 'lexical_unit': 'fund.v / finance.v / back.v / bankroll.v / support.v', 'definition': "A Supplier gives funds to a Recipient to fulfill a need or purpose (Imposed_purpose) of the Recipient.

He stared down at her hands, which were wrapped around the small book and the wallet, which she held against her chest, hidden in the folds of her sleeves.
Finally she turned to him, asking his name and reaching into the wallet, and holding out to him coins in her left hand.
He grasped her hand.
Her breath caught.
He pushed back her sleeve.
An intricate ring shown on her third finger.
The hand that pushed back the sleeve bore the same ring.
The wallet and the book and the coins dropped to the ground.
Now the traveler pulled his hood back and she cried out as she met the blue eyes.
Eyes that held no threat.
"Margaret," he said, and it sounded like a song, with the lilt only he had to his voice.
Margaret was unable to believe her eyes or to speak or do anything.
Tamlyn knelt before her, wrapping her hand in his.
"Margaret, can you still be mine?"
Her eyes were blurring with tears.
She raised her crimped right hand and placed it over his, and nodded yes.
"Yours, Tamlyn," she squeaked, and the tears flowed, and he stood and his arms were around her, holding, as he whispered her name again and again.
She felt his body shake with silent sobs against hers, and she held him, digging her knuckles into his tunic, then relaxing.
Thus they stood for a length of time neither one could have said, for in each heart reeled shock, joy, bitterness, gratitude, and grief in a poignant overwelling.
When finally they leaned apart, neither knew where to begin speaking.
Margaret made the sign of the cross over him in blessing.
A throat cleared nearby.
She turned toward the almoner and the handmaid, who waited, the almoner patiently and the woman staring hard at Tamlyn.
"My lord my husband, Tamlyn Braewode, has returned."
She fought a moment to control her voice, the handmaid's hands flew to her mouth.
"Please go now and prepare his house for him.
Prepare him a feast, for he that was lost to us, is found!"
In a few moments they stood alone under the linden trees.
Margaret stared at him and softly touched his downy beard.
"You have not changed since we said goodbye, while I have grown older."
"Because I have been in the Faerie Realm.
But my heart has grown old mourning each day for you."
"I have grown in willfulness, and not in wifeliness."
"You have grown very much in God, while I have forgotten how to live amongst the sons of Adam.
I know not how to be a husband to you, either.
But, I am willing to learn."
"And I also..."
She warbled, dashing tears from her reddening eyes.
"I did not think you would ever return.
I was sure you must have died, but I couldn't believe it.
I would not let myself think of it...How long has it been, now?"
"Seven years.
Seven years I have served the Queen Galorian for that I killed her only son."
"Moruan?"
"Aye."
"Her son...How...Will you stay, now?
Can you stay here with me, please?"
He saw the misery in her eyes, and she in his.
"I am free to stay, and that is my one desire, if you will have me.
I pray that we may never part.
But, Margaret, I have not taken the sword for seven years, but have been a servant.
You married a knight, but I don't know if I can be that any longer.
What think you of that?"
She looked at him in the same tunic in which he had ridden off, much faded and frayed at the sleeve edges.
His beautiful hair had been shorn; his beard was still downy.
Only the eyes looked older, sorrowful.
"I have no heart to watch you ride away to war, not knowing whether you may return to me.
You married a noble lady who was very fond of finery and dreamed of going to court.
I don't think I can be that any longer.
What think you of that, Tamlyn?"
He regarded her unruffled linen dress, without adornment or jewels, only the gold chain she had always worn, the betrothal ring on her left hand, and the spare, transparent married woman's headdress.
"That you are more lovely without finery," he said, "With the ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God's sight, and mine."
They stood, their eyes searching, under the lindens with the wind rustling in their leaves, and a linnet chatting in the branches overhead, and the shadows of clouds sweeping the meadows and green hills beyond.
"Sievan, you came back to me," Margaret murmured; he reached for her and she came.
Fires long closely banked burned with unexpected brightness.
That afternoon and evening and night were not long enough.
Margaret hardly slept, for she watched him laying beside her within the embroidered curtains, the lamp flickering behind the fabric.
He slept as if too tired to live, yet woke with eyes bright, turning to her and reaching for her, long before the dawn came.
Realization dawned slowly upon them that at long last they were together as God intended, and they spoke little of the thousands of days apart, for a horror of them lay bound in the pit of each heart, until morning when Margaret found courage to ask him of his time in the Faerie court.
He spoke of things which seemed so wondrous to Margaret.
"But so many times the Queen would rather sit and listen to me tell of what she called, things which angels desire to look into.
For they are forever servants of the King, never sons, as we are..."
Tamlyn's voice trailed off.
When he again spoke, his voice was very low.
"Oh, Margaret--" he took her hand, buried his face in it.
"It was wrong...to bind myself again to them, when I belonged to you...to live as a bondman, when free...and I knew it, not long after I had sworn myself...to serve her, and leave you alone and undefended.
Oh, God, forgive me, Margaret..."
She wrapped her arms bruising-tight around him.
A tumult of questions Margaret had not allowed herself to ask answered each other in a seethe of accusations, wonders and sorrows.
He was asking her forgiveness.
All that stood between them now was within her.
Could she?
"How could I not forgive you, love, after all this?"
said she, but as if persuading herself.
"Shall I resent you for your faithfulness, after it is mine at last?
If you had remained with me and been my knight, God only knows whether I would have you alive now.
Come, love, let us forget what lies behind.
We have each other now, and I am thankful.
I am too tired of being lonely, of being sad and angry-- yes, angry, love-- I want to forget it all, and be your wife.
I have loved you too long in a void to stop loving you now that I have you here with me.
Kiss me, Sievan, and know that I promise to forgive you."
Margaret told Tamlyn that his father and mother both had passed away, and of the judgment of King Fearnon concerning his title.
"I have done nothing towards applying for widowhood, but I expect your brother will be here soon to expedite matters."
Tamlyn made no reply to this.
His head hung down.
"I have dealt with him, with his prodding and manipulations and demands and petitions, for years.
Where he finds the time to bother with me, I know not.
He has fulfilled every ambition your father held for him, and more--" "Then let him have what he wants.
I will let him have it all, if he will leave us alone.
God knows he deserves every bit of it, title and all.
I have been no kind of son to my father and mother, and now they are gone."
Margaret hung her head, shocked at her own thoughtlessness.
"I am so sorry."
After a time he looked up.
"I had known, somehow.
Two winters ago."
Margaret and Tamlyn regarded one another, the losses and shadows of the past drifting like smoke between their gazes.
"Are you bitter toward Coltram?"
The question found Margaret unprepared.
She turned her head away.
"I would have to confess that my heart struggles toward him."
The sun was fully up now, and a knock on the door of the bower was heard.
Willa opened the door and called in, "My lady, unless you need me, I shall go our rounds with the houseman..."
"Good, Willa, go with God.
I don't need you now."
The door shut quickly.
In the silence, Margaret leaned back against the carven headboard and wrapped her arms around her knees.
She gazed far away beyond the embroidered bedcurtains.
When she spoke, her voice was low and quavering.
"I had a foundling, a little girl.
We called her Sunniva.
She lived to three years old.
It was almost two years ago she died."
Tears fell freely, but Margaret dabbed at them indifferently.
"My little darling, she helped me to live without you, and..."
She took a deep breath.
"After the Lord took her to Himself, I couldn't-- I had nothing-- Coltram came then, for once he was very sweet.
He asked me if I would come nurse Jehanna, for she had had a fit after one of her headaches and fallen unconscious.
I went, just to get away from the silence and idleness here.
"I nursed her, but she never awoke and passed away.
Then I tried to arrange it with Coltram to care for their children.
At first he seemed to like the idea, but then he changed his mind and sent the bairns instead to your sister, Tamarlanne.
"When I came home here, I knew I had to take care of someone.
I cried out to God, wondering why He was taking everyone away from me.
On the way to Church I passed the house of old Darcy, an elder woman who lives alone.
I looked in on her and she was ill, so I stayed and nursed her.
She begged me to see to another woman down the lane.
Darcy put out the word and soon I went nowhere without people begging me for remedies.
Many I could help, many I could not.
I hadn't realized how I missed having many people around me, for at Caer Aldene one was rarely alone.
"So I buried myself in that for a while, but I found myself more and more seeing the needs of their souls, for which my salves and poultices and potions could do nothing.
I found myself reading Gospel to them, asking them about their lives.
I saw their anguish and longed to see them born anew of God, with the hope and peace He gives.
Soon a crowd was gathering at sickbeds, for the spectacle of a Lady preaching and nursing, I suppose.
People espying at windows and doors, children hiding under beds to hear.
"Last year was a bad year for crops, and those who rented my fields near the River had their wheat and oats washed away, it was so wet, and all the crops were poor, even the fruits.
I bought grain from the west, and began to dole it out.
One morning as I prayed I remembered that Jesu is the Bread of Life, and I could feed their souls with that.
So I began...Well, some have called me Lady Preacher, though I like it little...The Word says women ought not to teach, but I must speak that which He gives me to say."
She looked at Tamlyn, who had risen to sitting on the bed.
