Mish so looked forward to those visits, and was seen to deliberately pinch her cheeks, just before Fea came, to give her now gaunt hollow face, some semblance of colour.
* * * *  By age 35, King Sigmall was considered an old man.
He had not campaigned for many years, and his midriff expanded as his hairline receded.
He had married off his two eldest daughters to local Lords, in order to retain their continued support.
When the neighbouring kingdom ruled by Eogan mac Cairill, began making threatening moves to take over his land, Sigmall had few choices.
One option was to defend his land.
His estate however was too small to support a standing army.
Sigmall's sons were all dead, as were his nearest relatives.
Sigmall could call on his client farmers, who were obliged to take up arms on behalf of their King, if commanded.
Unfortunately, they had little military training and lacked battle experience.
Another option was to hire one of the bands of Fianna that lived in the forests.
While not exactly mercenaries, one could obtain their services, by payment disguised as entertainment, feasting, drinking, lodging, and the lion's share of any booty.
Provided of course they thought the King's aspirations were ethical - and more important, achievable.
The third option was to form an alliance with a neighbouring kingdom, which was militarily stronger, through marriage.
King Sigmall still had one daughter of marriageable age, Fea, who, by now, while studying at St Brigid's, had just turned sixteen.
It transpired the only kingdom interested in such an alliance, which could pit them against the powerful clan, mac Cairill, was King Giona.
His lands were on the River Barrow, on the southern side of mac Cairill's lands.
While Giona had a large retinue of warriors, unfortunately he had only one son.
Even more unfortunate, the son was only ten years old.
That small fact did not deter King Sigmall.
It was the custom then for daughters to be given in arranged marriages, which it was hoped would bolster the political standing of both families.
King Sigmall dispatched the cleverest man at his court, the Bard, Pampinus Pronuntio, to negotiate the marriage between his sixteen-year-old daughter, and King Giona's ten-year-old son.
It was not considered necessary for the bride-to-be, to meet her potential groom, prior to the wedding ceremony.
King Sigmall also hired one of the smaller Fianna groups, led by Osgar, to strengthen his warrior base.
This would hopefully impress his new ally King Giona and deter his nemesis[1] - Eogan mac Cairill.
[1] nemesis from the Greek Goddess of retribution Nemesis, deserved punishment that comes to someone who hoped to escape it.
Fea was told of her impending marriage while at St Brigid's.
It is not recorded what her response was.
* * * *  The dreadful day came when Fea, tearfully, had to tell Sister Mish she had been summoned by her father to return home.
She was going to be married to a ten-year-old boy.
"My dear, why don't you stay here in the Monastery?"
said Mish.
"You don't have to go off and ruin the rest of your life.
You could become a nun, be a Bride of Christ."
Fea thought for a while, stroking Mish's brow before answering,  "I have been aware that this day would come sooner or later Mish.
Girls like me are the property of our fathers.
We have to do what they command.
Besides my father always treated my mother well, when she was alive."
"Along with his two other wives," interrupted Mish, with barely disguised venom.
"Yes, but that is how all men like him behave.
He wanted sons, and my mother was unable to give him sons."
"It is just so unfair," cried Mish.
"You have your whole life ahead of you.
If there is a God, why doesn't he look after girls like you."
"There, there Mish.
Don't be sad.
I cannot disobey my father.
Plus, I haven't experienced anything of the outside world yet.
All I've known for the past four years is within the walls of this wonderful old Monastery."
Sister Mish began weeping, "How long until your wedding?"
"Oh, I've been told about three months.
That should give me enough time," said Fea.
"Enough time for what?"
asked Mish quickly.
"Dear Sister Mish, I have a plan."
"What plan?"
asked Mish, trying to push herself up with one arm.
Fea bent down and whispered in Mish's ear.
She pausing often to look around for any eavesdroppers, then continued explaining, ever so quietly.
Mish paced both hands on Fea's shoulders, looking up at her in wonder,  "Do you think that could possibly work?
What about your father, he'll know."
"I'll make sure my father stays in his Dun and doesn't attend the wedding," said Fea, smiling confidently.
"Now you lay back and rest.
I have to go pack."
Mish waved goodbye feebly, at the retreating figure of the young girl.
Fea turned at the doorway, smiled that wonderful smile, and said,  "I'll come visit you, after the wedding," and was gone.
Sister Mish passed away, peacefully, two weeks after Fea left St Brigid's.
The other Nuns all noticed, her eyes were closed, but she seemed to be smiling.

Chapter 3 - You may call me Fea 
You may call me Fea 
"Why did you become a monk Brother Culann?"
The firelight played on the rugged facial features of the man sitting on the edge of the group.
His eyes half closed and his face softened.
He thought back to those days so long ago in Eire [ Ireland ].
Those wonderful days.
The first time he saw her, golden hair windblown, running around the corner laughing at something behind her - and collided with him.
"Milady, let me help you," he reached down and offered his hand, as she sat stunned but uninjured at his feet.
The smile was still there as she ignored his hand, picked herself up, and dusted off her skirts.
"Who are you?
I haven't seen you here before," eyeing the tall, dark haired, broad shouldered warrior up and down.
"I am called Culann milady.
I'm with the bodyguard to escort the Princess Fea to her wedding".
"Really," the smile turning to a mischievous grin, "you don't look old enough to escort anyone."
"Well, " embarrassed, "I'm good with the sword," patting the weapon at his side.
"So Master Culann, you belong to the Fianna.
That rag-tag bunch of warriors who live in the wild wood and sell their swords to the highest bidder."
Her hands on her hips now.
"We don't sell our services to just anyone, milady.
We have offered them to your King Sigmall, at his request".
"Do you read Latin?"
"No milady".
"Pity, I need something translated", she skipped past him and along the building.
Raising his voice, "May I know your name milady?"
Just before she rounded the next corner, her head turned, golden hair fanning out framing her gorgeous green eyed face, and with a smile that melted his heart,  "You may call me Fea," and was gone.
* * * *  Again...
"Why did you become a monk Brother Culann?"
He shook his head, bringing his thoughts back to the present.
"Oh, I once met a girl who was beyond my station".
Someone in the small group grunted, and as nothing more was offered by Culann, they pulled their cloaks over their heads and one by one, slept.
The fire had almost died, but Culann could not sleep.
He remembered those mischievous green eyes and her wonderful smile.
You may call me Fea.

3.1 The Wedding March 
The dinner passed in a blur for Culann who sat mesmerized next to the real Fea, who looked at him throughout the evening with an amused smile, as she asked him many questions.
He assumed he answered but could remember none next morning.
Three days after Culann had first met Fea, the Fianna began their journey, escorting the Princess and her entourage, to her arranged wedding with King Giona's son.
During that time Culann had discreetly asked about Fea.
He discovered she was the youngest daughter of King Sigmall.
She was considered headstrong, wilful, spoilt, with more education than was considered suitable for a girl, with a very engaging personality and most attractive.
The King had offered his daughter in marriage to the young son of a neighbouring King Giona, as part of a deal to seal a strategic alliance, as was the norm in Eire in those times.
The journey to King Giona's territory would normally take two days.
However, they could not journey through the lands of the neighbouring kingdom of mac Eogan.
The longer detour would add a further four days.
Culann's troupe of twenty-five men, led by Osgar, would escort the bridal party of Fea and her handmaidens, attendants and musicians, to the border of King Giona.
There they would be met by the bodyguard of the husband-to-be.
King Sigmall remained ensconced at home on his hill fort, in case his enemy Eogan mac Cairill, decided to attack the Dun while he was absent.
At the end of the first day, camp was set up near a small stream.
The main tent for the royal party was pitched and Osgar selected the first group of sentries, who moved out into the darkness to take up their positions.
Culann was cleaning his weapons when Osgar came up to him with a puzzled look.
"Culann, the Princess Fea has requested you and I dine with her group.
She said you can translate some Latin document.
I didn't know you spoke Latin".
Culann thought furiously for a moment before answering, "Only a little".
Osgar and Culann entered the royal tent.
Culann was half a head taller than his leader, with broader shoulders but not as thick set from the chest down.
A long table had been set, taking up most of the tent.
At the centre sat the Princess Fea in all her colourful clothes and regal gold jewellery.
On either side were her handmaidens and attendants.
Osgar walked opposite the Princess Fea and bowed his head,  "Princess Fea".
The Princess Fea smiled, and indicated he should sit opposite her.
Culann stood, confused.
He had a problem.
That wasn't Princess Fea.
Culann glanced down at the ladies in waiting, sitting either side, and immediately recognized that mischievous smile.
As he opened his mouth, Princess Fea, who was disguised as a handmaiden, put her finger to her lips, indicating silence, while patting the seat next to herself.
"So you remembered," she whispered, green eyes sparkling.
He was so close to her, his body felt on fire.
"Of course I remember.
But I don't speak Latin."
"No, but you shall.
Semper meus" [ always mine ].
The dinner passed in a blur for Culann.
He noted his leader Osgar, spoke animatedly to the lady at the centre of the table, who he believed to be Fea.
Culann meanwhile sat mesmerised [ mesmerise, to fascinate and hold spellbound ] next to the real Fea, who looked at him throughout the evening with an amused smile, as she asked him many questions.
He assumed he answered, but could remember none next morning.
By the time the sun had penetrated the ground mist next morning, the oxen were hitched again to the two wagons.
The scouts moved ahead and the whole entourage moved slowly off to an appointment with destiny that no one was anticipating.
