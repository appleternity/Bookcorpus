This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

I hate being your friend."
"Why?"
"Damn it, because of this."
Joe pushed him and Travis fell back onto the bed.
In one swift move, Joe was on top of him, one leg over Travis's legs, and one hand holding his chin so he had to face him.
"Because this is the way I want you... aren't you afraid?"
Travis shook his head and thought to himself, how can I tell you that the one I'm scared of the most, is myself?
He was doing his best to ignore the heat that Joe's body lit in his own.
"No, I'm not afraid of you anymore, Joe," he said.
Joe let himself fall onto the big comfy bed next to Travis and changed the subject.
"See?
It is big enough.
We can sleep together.
I challenge you to sleep with me for a whole month, if you dare."
"There is no use, I told you.
I won't change my feelings for you, even if we... share this bed."
"Then it's a deal.
All you have to do is come here after everybody else is sleeping."
"Sounds like I will be sneaking in." Travis lay on his side, his head propped on one hand.
"Are you taking the challenge?"
"First, tell me the rules."
"Which rules?"
"This challenge is like a game, isn't it?
Every game has rules."
Joe thought for a second.
"Okay, we can't touch each other."
"Each other?
You can't touch me.
I have no interest in touching you."
Joe turned on his side, so he could look Travis in the eyes.
"Travis, please be honest with me?"
"About what?"
"Are you sexually attracted to men?"
Travis moved his eyes from one side to the other, as if refusing to meet Joe's.
After a few seconds, he asked, "And you-- what about your relationship with Matt?"
"I asked you first, Travis."
"If you answer my question honestly, I might answer yours."
"Okay.
Matt and I met at college, lived together for six years and broke up ten months ago.
His fault, he was unfaithful to me more than once.
I can't forget or forgive that.
Your turn."
"That's it?
No more details?"
"There is nothing else worth telling."
Joe leaned closer.
"Travis," he prompted, "do you like men?"
After deeply sighing, Travis said, "Yes.
I feel attracted to men, but control it, because it's wrong."
****
Regardless of what he had thought when he first met him, that answer surprised Joe.
"It's worse to repress your desire and out it as rage against the world.
Think about it-- people concluding you're nuts, when you're really in need of some sexual release of the right kind."
He paused before asking, "When was the last time you had sex?"
"Come on, Dr. Freud, are you serious?"
Travis was playing cool, but his voice gave away his nerves.
"Travis, answer the question, please."
"Before Sophia got sick," he muttered.
The honesty he was getting from Travis was great, but Joe didn't want to dwell on anything for too long, afraid Travis would leave the room before they got a deal.
"There is no reason to be ashamed of that.
I've been kind of celibate for many months, because the idea of intimacy brought memories of Matt and his infidelity.
It was as if he had killed the pleasure of the act for me."
Joe silently added, Until I met you, and then, it was madness.
For having you, no matter what.
"Have you been with anybody else besides Matt?"
"Yes."
Travis sat on his ankles with an indignant expression.
"Were you unfaithful to him too?"
"No.
I spent months without sex after Matt and I were done."
"And?"
"Aren't you being too nosy?"
Travis laughed.
"Ah!
You don't like your own medicine, Dr. Freud."
Joe briefly laughed too, and with a serious expression said, "The sexual dynamic between men is different."
"Different?
How?"
"There is no dating the usual way, one takes what's offered.
The romance might come later or never come."
"Hold it right there.
So you got the chance of having sex with some random guy and took it?"
"Didn't you ever hear of a one night stand?"
"Yep."
"There wasn't any need to spend any more time with another man than necessary for a mutual safe and quick release."
"Mutual safe and quick release," Travis repeated thoughtfully.
"It sounds very therapeutic."
"Trust me, it is."
Joe's grin turned wicked.
"Would you like to give it a try?"
"No, thanks."
"But we're doing the challenge at least."
"Wait a second.
What about my children?
I don't want to imagine them finding us sleeping together."
Joe sat up and buried his face into his hands.
"Yeah, that would be terrible.
Not to mention Mom, or Mary."
"Well, it was an interesting project while it lasted."
Travis's relief was obvious.
Then Joe remembered something.
Rising to his feet he opened a closet and found a gadget that he dropped on the bed saying, "It's solved.
I'll tell my family that you're going to use my office to do the work you bring home, and this monitor will let us know if any of the children wake up in the middle of the night."
Travis looked at what Joe showed him.
It was a surveillance set of some kind.
It included a camera, with a small monitor screen, similar to a baby monitor.
"Are you sure?
I mean, will this detect noise too?"
"Yes.
It's noise activated, it will turn on if anybody passes by it.
We can set it at the bottom of the stairs."
"Why do you have this?"
Joe wasn't ready to share with Travis the real motivation for his interest in surveillance systems, so he told him the other true reason.
"We were being robbed at The Handyman, and I got a few of these to catch the thieves, and we did.
I brought this one home for Mom to use with Dad when she was in a different room.
He refused to be monitored like a baby."
"Only you could suggest such a thing to your father."
Joe shrugged.
"You haven't seen how it is when he's not feeling well.
We can use it, and if any of the children come looking for you, you will have enough time to get into the office, or go downstairs, before they get here."
Travis looked from the gadget to Joe and back again.
"Okay, let's give it a try," he said and quickly added, "And you, Joe-- what is your part of the deal?
If you can't touch me, how are you going to change my mind?"
"I don't know yet.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't say.
It would be like showing my cards, don't you think?"
"Agreed, but I don't get what's in it for you yet?"
Joe couldn't tell him that just seeing him made him happy.
And the idea of sharing his bed with him was very exciting.
He ignored Travis's question and instead said, "The challenge is that we will share the bed for a whole month, beginning tonight, and I can't touch you.
If I touch you in an intimate manner, I lose.
And if at the end of that month, nothing has happened between us, I must accept defeat, and become your friend with no teasing ever again."
He pointed at him.
"Your rule is that you have to be honest.
If you ever feel anything, you can't hide it.
You must act on it, Travis.
And that's my gain, if you will."
"What exactly do you mean?"
"If you ever feel like touching me or kissing me, since I can't do it, you are the one who must take the lead."
"And if I do-- emphasis on if-- what would you do?"
Joe raised his eyebrows in a speculative manner and grinned before he lay on the bed again.
"If you take the initiative, it means I've won."
He eased Travis down onto the bed and positioned himself so that each had a thigh pressed against the other's genitals.
At first Travis remained serene, as if it took him a few seconds to realize what the new position would do to his cock, then he gasped but said nothing.
"Don't worry," Joe murmured against his mouth, "I'm not doing anything now, simply answering your question."
They stared at each other for a few seconds Joe steadied himself on his elbows and made a couple of brief movements; enough to send the right message.
He leaned forward and whispered in Travis's ear, "If you ever kiss me, or touch me in an intimate way, I wouldn't stop until I heard you yelling-- Ahh, Joe, that's it, Oh!
Joe, Ahh!"
He basically finished the comment by faking an orgasm, tremors and all.
"You pervert.
