This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

It's not like I come up here all the time.
Not like Justus or Erway or Gallowing.
For chrissake, they're up here every other week, it seems.
Leave the old lady and the kids at home, you know, bring one of the secretaries, and I use that term loosely."
He glanced momentarily at the man sitting in the chair.
"Why did you have to find me?
They're up here a lot more than I am.
Why couldn't you find them instead?"
"Do you call or does someone call you?"
"I just call MacElroy and everything gets set up, no problem.
Flies me into Werkmann's, stocks the cabin, gets a guide if I want it, other companions if I want them."
"Is that your pickup?"
Jenny asked.
"Which one?"
"The Ford.
Or do you drive the Chevy?"
He shook his head.
"They're always just here.
Trucks, food, booze, guns, cabins, women."
He looked down again at the man sitting in the chair.
"A guide.
I don't have to do a thing.
It could be a nice setup."
"Who else comes up here?
Does MacElroy come?
Does he ever stay up here?"
The senator glanced over at Pat.
"MacElroy's a she.
Where've you been all your life?
Congresswoman!"
His words were beginning to slur.
He had now finished two big glasses of the Jack Daniels and had started on another but the contempt in his voice was clear.
"Why the hell'd they ever start letting the women in?
All they do is bitch and moan and stir up trouble.
Bunch of damned bleeding hearts!
You try to follow some kind of budget and they turn right around and spend what you know you're not gonna get.
They love spics and niggers and mothers with too many kids and kids with no daddy and daddies with no place to go home to.
That's what they spend it on, their time and our money.
They got committees for pregnant kids and committees for dirty winos and committees for tottering old ladies and committees for ... shit!"
He threw the glass in the sink.
It was plastic and bounced back out and went spinning across the floor.
"Write your goddam story.
Put my picture in it.
You want all the sordid details?
Then you go talk to Jones.
Or go back to Capital and catch MacElroy or better yet Longen.
Yeah, you go talk to Longen, that SOB snob!
Mr.
High'n'Mighty'd give you an earful.
They'll know all you want to know.
More'n you'd ever want to know!
But you won't get it out of them as easy as you did outta me.
They're tough and they're up there high enough you won't touch 'em.
Now get your smart ass outta here, hot shot!
G'wan.
Get out.
All of you!"
He punctuated his last sentence with a broad swipe of his arm, knocking bottles and glasses and kitchenware onto the linoleum with a clatter.
He took a clumsy step across the litter.
"Get out of here, I say!"
His arms and hands waved wildly as he stumbled toward them.
"Leave, vamoose, bug off!
I don't want you around no more!
Clear out, all of you!
Just leave me alone!"
He turned and sat dejectedly on the bed with his back to them.
The man in the robe was the first to move.
He got up and walked around Pat, out the door and back to his cabin.
Pat left right behind him and stood, waiting, in front of his pickup.
Jenny walked over and put her hand on the senator's shoulder.
"Will you be all right, Senator Roggins?
Can we give you a ride somewhere?
Let someone know so they can come pick you up?"
"Thank you, Brush, but no."
He shook his head slowly.
"You're not going in my direction but thank you anyway."
She squeezed his shoulder and left, pulling the door shut as well as she could behind her.
"Well," she demanded when they were both standing beside the pickup.
Pat made no response, looked back at the cabin, then opened the door and got in. Jenny did the same and they backed away from the woodpile they were headed toward and onto the road.
The ROAD CLOSED barricade was still as Jenny had left it the previous day and they went past without stopping.
Pat didn't stop at the asphalt, turned south toward Crossroad, the tires protesting as he worked his way through the gears.
As he did this, State Senator Vincent Roggins walked dizzily to the pickup and back, shuffling his feet and with stooped shoulders.
He left the door open and spent a little time cleaning the debris from the floor.
When he thought it looked presentable, he brushed the creases from his pants and inspected his jacket, standing in front of a mirror and carefully fastening each button.
He brushed a piece of lint from his lapel, pulled the white handkerchief a little higher up in the breast pocket and patted it, smoothed his hair back with the palm of both hands, walked to the kitchen and downed two more full glasses of Jack Daniels, lay back on the bed and fluffed several pillows under his head so he was comfortable.
He rested the shotgun on his chest, the muzzle under his chin, squeezed one lone drop from the corner of his eye, reached down and, just barely able to reach it, pushed both triggers.
Chapter 35
Pat braked hard to a stop in the no parking zone behind a white Porsche.
Normally he would have stopped and admired the car, but today he strode past it with never a glance and into the Park headquarters building.
He ignored the handful of visitors, didn't look out over the lake through the big, floor-to-ceiling windows, brushed past a surprised Ranger Kyle and the closed doors of the downstairs offices.
He took the stairs two at a time, ignored Suzanne Lemp busily working her IBM, and pushed open the door to David Jones' office.
Caroline Werkmann jumped off his desk where she had been sitting and almost into the Park director's lap.
She recovered as she turned and pulled at the hem of her skirt, smoothed it down the back and across the front.
David Jones looked up from his chair.
"You did it, didn't you?"
Pat said to the man, ignored the woman as she brushed a lock of hair back from her face.
"You pushed Werkmann off the cliff.
You swiped my camera and knocked me in the head, didn't you?
You came back up the utility's service road and gathered him up and put him in his own car and then pushed it over the edge.
You blew the mountain down on me when you saw I was catching on.
Or did you send out for Botts or Glenson to do that for you?
You sent them to rig my house, Bert told me that.
Did you know the DCI was coming or was that just a lucky break?"
"You're crazy!
I did no such thing!"
the director protested, now standing.
Pat ignored him.
"I just left Senator Roggins.
He has a very interesting story to tell.
I'm sure he'd be glad to take you with him when he goes down."
David Jones edged around the desk.
Pat reached down and took the lighter lying beside the little silver ash tray.
"How'd you get this back from Russell?"
Pat looked at it.
"Just like the one Roggins' guide has.
National Guard, I think he said it was.
When's your next weekend, Jones?
Will MacElroy be there or does she stay in Capital?
Or how about Longen?
Maybe he'll be there.
Or maybe it's better if the two of you never see each other, no one gets suspicious that way, do they?"
Pat took a step toward the director, holding out the lighter in his hand, and was surprised when Jones grabbed his arm, stepped under it and snapped it down.
All the memories came flooding back and Pat reacted without thinking, didn't try to pull his arm back but rolled forward and past the man, reversing the advantage as he did.
He twisted and came back up immediately on his feet.
Jones reached again, but this time Pat feinted, then grabbed the arm of the director, pulled it forward so Jones moved as Pat stepped to the side, still held the wrist as he brought his free forearm down heavy on the shoulder joint, pulled his opponent's arm back as he did so, separating the ball from the socket.
Air escaped from Jones' mouth but he found no voice.
Pain halted his thought process and his vision screened over with a web of tiny red lines.
He grabbed at the shoulder with his free hand, saw the floor come up and smash suddenly into his face.
He became aware of the pain in his legs and back, followed immediately by the pain in his nose and forehead.
His mouth filled with the salty taste of his own blood and he covered his head with the arm he could still move.
Pat straightened when he saw the man had no more fight left in him.
He clenched his teeth and both hands, exhaled and stepped back.
Caroline Werkmann, on the other hand, slipped off both shoes, lifted her skirt to free her legs, twirled, and kicked Pat in his spine, just above the tail bone.
His legs lost all sensation and he went to his knees.
She twirled again as he twisted his head to look at her.
It seemed as if the world had gone into slow motion.
He could see her smooth, shapely legs as she balanced on one, twirled and brought the other solidly into the side of his head.
The colors in the room went negative as her foot connected with his temple.
The ceiling light was black, the floor white, the person in front of him black as it bounced back a step.
He grabbed the edge of the desk to keep from falling and looked up.
He could feel the grass, rough and cold, beneath him, could see the glint of something as it moved in the moonlight, felt the pain as it connected with his head.
He could see the beautiful legs of Caroline Werkmann as they disappeared around the Lincoln, heard the Road Maggot lurch to life, sank back as they all disappeared into the night.
He was thinking in the past, didn't see Caroline Werkmann grab the little ivory-handled pistol from her purse lying on the desk, point it toward him, and pull the trigger.
He was aware of but didn't really feel the little piece of lead as it shattered his collarbone, ricocheted up and away from his head.
Thinking she had kicked him again, he brought both hands up in front of his face to ward off another blow.
The second shot entered his forearm, went easily through muscle and sinew and came to rest against the bone, close to his elbow.
He lost his balance and fell on his side between the desk and the visitor's chair, now dimly aware of his plight as he looked up and into the muzzle of the weapon held firmly in both her hands.
He didn't have even the strength to cover his face this time.
The third and last shot went wide as Jenny grabbed her arm and forced it up.
An animal hiss escaped the beautiful lips of Caroline Werkmann and she backed away and lifted her skirt again, ready to spin and deliver a blow on the woman in front of her.
