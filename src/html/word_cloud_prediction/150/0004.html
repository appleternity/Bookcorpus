This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

Mystique asked.
"He shares my feelings for you two.
I care about you, so he cares also," Daemon told her, hoping Angelica was through asking questions, yet knowing she wasn't.
"Daemon, what are you try to hide?
I know you're hiding something.
What happened during the four days we were in jump space getting here?"
Angelica demanded.
"Please don't make me tell you," Daemon pleaded.
Mystique had never seen Daemon this ashamed before and would have dropped the matter, but Angelica wanted to know.
Angelica just stared at Daemon, forcing him to explain what had happened.
"All right.
The ancient told me I needed to understand the price of calling on a demon for assistance.
He gave Shektee permission to do as she pleased with Sara, Nelson, and Mystique.
Stacy was too weak and he would not risk you being hurt, but he did make sure you felt what the others were going through.
I couldn't do anything to stop it.
Just before we left jump space, he sealed the memory of what'd happened so none of you would remember it.
He told me if I ever take vengeance against Shektee for what she did, he would remove the seal and you would remember every detail," Daemon confessed.
"So I spent four days as the sexual chew toy of a demon," Mystique asked, in shock.
"I knew you should have killed her the minute you knew what she was," Angelica stated, not sure who she was more upset with.
All three sat quietly for a few minutes thinking about what Daemon had said.
"No, Daemon was right not to kill her.
Without her help I'd be dead, and you two would still be stuck on Endeavor," Mystique observed.
"How can you say that?
I can only imagine what she did to you.
It must have been horrible," Angelica protested, amazed that Mystique would be so forgiving.
"Yeah, imagine.
I can't remember anything she did, which is a heck of a lot better than what I do remember my mother's clients doing.
She auctioned off my virginity the day I turned twelve and the bastard who won was not gentle.
So, fine, Shektee probably did some really nasty things.
I can't remember it, so I don't care.
We're alive and we're off that godforsaken planet," Mystique stated with more emotion than Angelica and Daemon had heard from her before.
"Daemon, don't you ever blame Shektee for what she did.
She was given permission and she didn't kill anyone," Mystique ordered, challenging Daemon to argue with her.
"All right, but I am never going to ask for her help ever again," Daemon stated.
Angelica was horrified at what she had learned, but Mystique had suffered worse than she had; if Mystique was willing to let it go, she would do the same.
"Okay, so back to the original question; what did he do to us?"
Mystique asked.
"I am not sure.
He just said he made you tougher.
It's not like I was in a position to demand details," Daemon explained, exasperated that he had been forced to tell them what had happened.
"All right, don't worry about it.
I am going to take a shower and then head to bed," Mystique told them as she got up and walked to the bathroom.
She stopped at Daemon and gave him a hug before hitting him hard in the arm.
Angelica could sense that Mystique was upset, but she was quickly calming down.
"I think we should all head to bed, though I don't think I am going to sleep very well tonight."
*** The next morning was a flurry of activity.
A tailor arrived at eight to take measurements, and left to be replaced by a stylist.
The stylist trimmed and styled their hair while Mr. Jones arrived to collect fingerprints and DNA for their files, and perform the retinal scans.
Mr.
Jones informed them that they would be meeting with Ambassador Quinn at ten.
At nine-thirty, the tailor returned with dresses for Angelica and Mystique and a suit for Daemon.
Angelica was thrilled with the color and style of her dress, while Mystique only looked at hers with distaste.
Twenty minutes later, Mr. Jones ushered them out into the hall.
They went back to the elevator and down to the third floor and into a maze of hallways.
Angelica quickly lost track of where they were, while Daemon and Mystique noted every turn.
Mystique instinctively noticed every lock and surveillance device they passed.
Five minutes after they left their suite, Mr. Jones opened the door to a large reception room.
An assistant sat at a huge desk next to an ornately carved and stained pair of wooden doors.
Two guards in polished powered armor stood flanking the doors.
Six comfortable-looking chairs lined the wall opposite the door. Mr. Jones stepped forward and introduced the group to Mrs. Farnsworth, Ambassador Quinn's assistant.
Mystique's eye was drawn to six perfectly spaced half-inch diameter marks that lined the front of the desk.
In her mind, Mystique could see those circles blasting outward as projectiles were shot at whoever was standing in front of the desk. Mrs. Farnsworth used an old-fashioned intercom to announce their arrival to Ambassador Quinn.
A minute later, everyone heard the click of the door's lock being magnetically moved into the open position.
Mystique was the only one in the group to hear the other five locks slide into the open position.
Mr.
Jones opened the door and motioned for them to enter, while he stayed in the outer office.
Ambassador Quinn's office was very large and decorated in an old English style.
The lower half of the walls were paneled with a dark stained wood.
An average-sized desk made of the same wood but stained a lighter shade sat at the far end of the room.
A sitting area with two Victorian sofas and two armchairs positioned around a coffee table strategically blocked the path to the desk.
A wet bar stood against the right wall, halfway between the door and the desk.
A large, half-full bookshelf was mounted on the left wall opposite the bar.
Ambassador Quinn stood next to the armchair facing the door.
He was an average-sized man standing about five-feet-seven and weighing no more than one hundred seventy pounds.
His dark brown hair was just starting to gray around the edges, giving him a fatherly, good-natured look.
The only distinguishing feature was his steel-gray eyes that showed his true strength of will to anyone paying attention.
A middle-aged lady in an expensive-looking gray suit sat on the sofa to the left.
She had short blond hair and dark green eyes, her high cheekbones giving her the look of a retired model.
She watched carefully as they entered the room.
Angelica felt her stare and a pressure in her mind as she walked in. Mystique was next to enter.
She gave the two occupants a quick glance before focusing on finding the surveillance devices hidden around the room.
Mystique stopped and gave a startled little gasp when a strange thought entered her head.
I can see you; there is no use trying to hide from me.
Daemon walked in behind Mystique and was the only one who observed her reaction.
He quickly scanned the room and knew immediately what had happened.
"Lady, that isn't polite.
I suggest you stop," Daemon stated, causing Angelica to look back at him.
Ambassador Quinn shifted his gaze from Angelica to Daemon.
"Daemon, what's the matter?"
Angelica asked.
Before Daemon had a chance to reply, the woman started to speak.
"My lord, the lady here is projecting a calming aura that I believe will make people more cooperative.
The girl is trying to mask her presence.
The gentleman I am not able to read at all.
He has a very powerful active defense."
Angelica and Mystique felt the presence of the beast enter Daemon but this time it was different.
The beast was not angry; it was cold.
The lady on the sofa went rigid, the veins in her temples bulging as her mouth opened in a silent scream.
Then the beast was gone and the lady collapsed, unconscious.
Angelica was the first to react, moving quickly to the lady's side while she reached out with her senses to find any damage the beast had caused.
Mystique stepped to the side, not sure what was going to happen next.
Ambassador Quinn stood quietly observing.
"She is not physically injured," Daemon said to Angelica, knowing the ambassador was listening very closely.
"She has just learned some minds are closed for a reason.
If she hadn't persisted in entering mine, nothing would have happened."
"Ambassador, my sister's calming aura helps me stay in control of my anger.
The lady forced her way through the barriers I have built in my mind to control that anger.
Once she was through them, she saw the demon I must control.
If you wish, I will wait in the outer office," Daemon explained to Ambassador Quinn in a solemn voice filled with regret.
"I don't believe that will be necessary, but I will post my guards on this side of the door," Ambassador Quinn replied.
"Guards, step inside, please," Ambassador Quinn ordered through the open door.
Daemon stepped in a few paces to make room as the armored guards moved in and took up their positions near the door.
With a little help from Angelica, the telepathy lady started to awaken.
She was a little disorientated at first but quickly recovered.
She took a quick look around the room until she spotted Daemon, at which point she yelled for the guards to kill him.
Daemon focused his aggression sense on the guards and waited, standing with his back to them.
Ambassador Quinn was the only one to react.
As Daemon thought, the guards were waiting for his order before attacking.
"No.
There is no need for violence.
Mr.
Grayson has explained what happened and is under guard.
Until he commits an act of violence, he is not to be harmed."
"But ambassador, you don't understand; he's possessed by a powerful demonic spirit.
He must be destroyed," the lady argued.
Angelica had heard enough.
"Ambassador, I think we should go," she told him as she turned and started toward the door.
Angelica hadn't taken three steps before the door swung shut and the locking bolts slid into place.
"This is my meeting and I will say when it is over and who kills who," Ambassador Quinn stated with anger showing in both his voice and his face.
"Now sit down."
Angelica put her hand on Daemon's forearm, hoping to keep him calm.
She knew it wouldn't take much more for him to decide she was in danger and kill the guards.
Daemon looked down at her and winked, surprising her as he allowed his amusement at the threats to cross their link.
The guards had moved inside Daemon's kill range and he was confident he would be able to kill or incapacitate both of them before they could react.
Angelica just smiled, proud that Daemon was staying so calm.
She returned to the sofa and sat across from the lady.
"Mystique, come sit next to me, please," Angelica requested politely.
Both guards shifted slightly as Mystique stepped out from behind Ambassador Quinn.
During the commotion, everyone had forgotten about Mystique and she had carefully slid in behind the ambassador.
Mystique stepped around the chair and table to sit next to Angelica.
The guards relaxed again and Ambassador Quinn took a moment to organize his thoughts.
"Mr.
Grayson, would you have a seat," the ambassador asked, leaving little doubt that he had meant it as an order and not a request.
"I think it would be best for me to stay standing over here near the guards.
I don't think the lady would be comfortable with me that close," Daemon replied respectfully, using the etiquette his father had taught him.
Ambassador Quinn took a moment to look at Daemon and decided he had intended no insult.
"Very well.
This is the Lady Kathrin Donavan.
She is a registered level-six telepath.
I felt it prudent to have her present for this meeting.
