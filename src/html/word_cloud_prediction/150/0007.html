She turned and ran out of the dome, leaving Brian too shocked to follow.
The next time Brian saw Elizabeth she was no longer the person he had come to know.
Chapter Twenty-Six Lyell Inard's University of Euchenor ship touched down on Antiope to little notice of the planet.
Once in Antiopian orbit, the ship tracked the signal of the Almayer and set down nearly on top of the sand-buried ship.
The Almayer, which had been a research ship sent to discover an unknown part of the universe, now had its burial beneath the sands for some future anthropological expedition to uncover.
Lyell had been monitoring the standing effects reports of the crew since they first entered their university-sponsored black hole.
He had not received a report for some time now, other than odd messages that appeared to be getting time-distorted through the micro-black holes the Almayer used to send the messages back to the university.
Lyell scanned the planet for life finding two concentrations of people--one near the SeekerM79 site the crew of the Almayer originally came to investigate and another some distance from where Lyell landed his ship.
He set off for the SeekerM79 site in a slow ground transport.
The journey had been a hard one for Lyell.
He'd held his position at the university since before Whaton and Ioma were born and this type of fieldwork was something he had hoped was in his past; however, given the sensitivity of his business on Antiope, Lyell knew that no one else from the university could go in his place.
Lyell arrived at the dig site not to find the much-studied SeekerM79 he had anticipated or the ruins of an Ancient Antiopian society he thought he might find uncovered but instead he found Ioma Isvray along with a group of Euchenorians living in part ruins, part newly constructed houses.
The dress they wore was a cross between an Euchenorian mission suit and what someone on Euchenor might wear if trying to impersonate an ancient Euchenorian--long, loose-fitting robes with hoods and belts fastened tightly around the waist.
Lyell wore a white, one-piece mission suit with a large University of Euchenor crest on the front.
He stopped his transport in the middle of the makeshift yet ancient dwelling.
Ioma and the others had seen him coming and greeted him as he exited his transport.
"Doctor Inard!"
Ioma exclaimed, walking toward him."You have no idea how good it is to finally be joined by another academic on this planet!"
Lyell stepped out and returned Ioma's joyful expression for only a moment as he greeted her.
He then turned somber.
Before he could begin, Ioma gave a preamble."You have to understand, Lyell ...
Doctor Inard...
I wanted to continue the academic mission here.
The movie destroyed everything we set out to accomplish on this planet.
First the Euchenor City people came, and then the actors, and then once the film made its way back to the home planet, all of these new Euchenorian settlers showed up.
Some of them are here with me."
Ioma motioned to those around her."They understand the importance of what's buried beneath us."
Lyell stopped her."I know about the film, Ioma.
That's not why I'm here."
He paused pensively.
"The Euchenorian elders are not pleased with the recent happenings on this planet; I fear they've been monitoring it even closer than we at the university have, through means we can't even imagine.
I found out about their surveillance when they demanded I turn over all of the standing effects reports recorded from the Almayer during the mission.
That's when I knew they were extremely interested in the planet's happenings."
Ioma responded,"Monitoring the planet for what?
Everyone saw the film on Euchenor.
They know what's going on here, or what went on here, well, not really, the former actually."
"The surveillance began after the film reached Euchenor," replied Lyell."When Euchenorians began coming here that's when the elders took notice.
The Euchenorian government had already been watching the group that describes themselves as the New Selfists closely.
To the elders, the New Selfist way of thinking is quite dangerous for all concerned with ensuring future technological progress."
A small group had gathered on the outskirts of where Lyell and Ioma were speaking.
They emerged from their faux traditional-Antiopian dwellings wearing dress Lyell recognized as costumes from the film meant to portray the Ancient Antiopian people.
The group consisted mostly of men and women who looked to Lyell much like the students back at the university.
"We are not the New Selfists," Ioma began."I am still here on an academic mission to understand the Antiopian people.
These people who have joined me feel even stronger than I do about that.
They were drawn here by seeing the film and understanding the beauty of the Antiopian people and their belief system."
Lyell pondered this, looking around at the group and their dress that clearly illustrated that what Ioma was saying was indeed reality.
The people appeared to no longer be totally Euchenorian.
Their faces looked relaxed and they had little urgency to their movements as a good Euchenorian should--always on the lookout for how he or she may benefit the future generations.
"I fear those interested back on Euchenor will not differentiate between you and the New-Selfists, should they decide to act."
"Act?"
asked Ioma.
"That's why I came," said Lyell,"I had to see for myself what was happening here and now that I see it, I must warn everyone on this planet that they are in danger of having their Euchenorian Meta Data completely erased from the Great Banks."
At this, several in the group began talking quietly.
A woman in the crowd voiced her concern.
"How will The God Generation know to bring us back if they cannot locate our data?"
Lyell looked at the woman who asked the question.
She wore a tunic over a standard mission suit given to civilian synthetic black hole travelers.
"That's the idea," Ioma chimed in before Lyell could respond.
She chuckled as she spoke."I've never been much of a writer beyond academic prose but this is going to make for a highly publishable paper.
I wish I could be there when Whaton, Vermos, and all the other so-called 'New Selfists' reject their newfound way of thinking on even the remotest of possibilities their data will be erased from the Great Banks--which, by the way, I don't think is even possible."
Lyell returned her chuckle, acknowledging the idea of the New Selfists fleeing back to Euchenor upon hearing the news.
But his face quickly returned to its former somber state.
"I fear they are quite serious about pulling the information from the Great Banks and, with determination, I likewise fear they may be able to do so."
Ioma contemplated Lyell's statement, analyzing its validity with academic rigor and precision.
Despite their name, the Great Banks were not storage facilities, so how could they be deleted?
Ioma thought this through: when a new Euchenorian was born, a signal completely unique to this person was launched into the universe through a series of self-replicating synthetic black holes.
The black holes themselves created other black holes that skipped the data across the universe.
As marvelous of an invention self-replicating synthetic black holes were, this was not what the Great Banks consisted of.
These self-replicating black holes could only replicate in one direction.
This direction was set to the very center of the universe.
The center of the universe was also where the universe began, so since their inception these black holes had been replicating their way back in time to where the universe itself was born and began its great expansion, which still continued to that day.
As all Euchenorians were aware, the universe would at some future point stop expanding and begin to contract and destroy everything in its way as it did so.
The last portion of the universe to be destroyed by this crunching of space and time would, of course, be where the universe began and that is what Euchenorians referred to as the Great Banks--the absolute safest place in the universe to store the data that would allow future, more technologically advanced Euchenorians to know what to create when they constructed the past.
But how could someone on Euchenor stop the self-replicating black holes travelling faster than light to the center of the universe?
After some thought, Ioma posed this very question to Lyell.
Lyell grinned."Ioma, you live in the world of academia.
You must understand that there is a power structure on Euchenor that controls what does and doesn't happen.
For instance, how do you know your data was ever even sent?
Did you see it happen?
Have you been monitoring its progress as it travels through the universe?"
Lyell paused, allowing his rhetorical question to take effect on Ioma and those around her.
"I'm not saying that's the case but we must recognize that we are not in charge of these things and if those on Euchenor see someone as a threat to their way of life, and, more importantly, a threat to the prosperity of the home planet's God Generation, they will act.
And they will use all technological means possible to ensure success."
"It's not that I am some naive academic, Lyell," Ioma scoffed."It's that you are no longer one at all.
We are here to discover new knowledge.
If the knowledge we discover is to the disliking of some on Euchenor then so be it.
Every day here on Antiope we are learning more.
I do not intend to stop."
Lyell nodded."What of the two graduate assistants you brought with you?
I read in the Almayer's file they are still on the planet.
But the ship itself is abandoned.
Buried, actually."
Ioma's face dropped slightly, realizing she had not thought of Elizabeth and Brian in some time.
"They must be with the New Selfists," Ioma said, unable to hide a certain degree of disgust in her voice.
Lyell touched her shoulder.
"I'll go there now.
I have to.
I'll tell the New Selfists the same thing I've told you.
If the graduate assistants want to leave the planet as members of the university, I will escort them back to Euchenor safely."
Ioma smiled at her boss and old mentor, remembering the high regard she held him in as both an academic and as a person.
Lyell boarded his ground craft and set off bound for the New Selfists, his warning still ringing in the ancient but now inhabited Antiopian ruins as he left.
*** Earlier, after leaving the New Selfist camp, Elizabeth made her way back to the Almayer.
She dug herself through the sand toward the top hatch of the ship but stopped when she saw a synthetic black hole open in the distance far above her.
The ship that came through was an unrecognizable one that carried none other than Doctor Lyell Inard, chair of the Department of Alien Anthropology at the University of Euchenor.
The ship was an old research vessel, one that would only be used for the purpose of carting old intellectuals through expensive synthetic black holes as cheaply as possible.
As the ship came closer to Elizabeth and the Almayer, she could see the university crest on the bottom of the vessel.
Another Euchenorian man has come across the universe to tell me what to do, Elizabeth thought, looking straight up at the descending ship.
Euchenorians and their notion they had out-evolved the need for gender--this was surely not the case there on Antiope and not the case on Euchenor either.
Elizabeth thought about how Lyell and nearly all the leaders at the university were men who preached that gender no longer mattered in society.
It angered her that she had to travel through a black hole to an unknown planet to come to this simple ironic realization.
Elizabeth stopped digging through the sand as Lyell's ship came down nearly on top of her.
The small amount of orange she had removed reclaimed the speck of the Almayer's hull her efforts uncovered.
Elizabeth stood and began to run.
She ran not only from the Almayer and Lyell but from the tracks she had made in the sand that led back to the New Selfist camp.
She kept going until she was unable to see the university ship touch down.
She also did not see Lyell exit the ship with several other university and government officials.
Had she turned to look as she ran, Elizabeth would only have seen dark outlines in the distance.
She began to walk, wearing her mission suit and nothing else.
The hotness of the Antiopian day quickly depleted the essential life systems contained within the technology of the suit, particularly the hydration effect afforded by the suit's skin, which was constructed of hyper-hydrated material that, when in contact with the skin, kept the body at an optimal level of hydration while also providing key vitamins and nutrients.
Elizabeth, however, had been wearing her suit for days without re-immersing it in the materials necessary to recharge its abilities.
The Almayer was far behind her before she realized this and turned around, attempting to follow her tracks back.
She found them easily enough at first but as she came upon her earlier ones they got shallower from Antiopian winds until she could no longer see them.
Heat rose from an object in the distance, forming distorted lines on the horizon.
Elizabeth walked toward it to find exposed rock popping out of the desert by Antiopian tectonic plates.
Examining the rock in her dehydrated state, Elizabeth saw striations likely made over millions of years--much older than the ruins she had seen around the SeekerM79 site."Ancient" on Antiope was very much a relative term.
"I'll be an Ancient Antiopian artifact for future anthropologists to discover," Elizabeth said aloud, slouching down in the shade of the rock.
The frailness of her voice shocked her and sent a short-lived adrenaline burst of anxiety through her body.
Would there even be future anthropologists?
Elizabeth thought about her early schooling on Euchenor, which had taught her that there indeed would not be.
With the power of Euchenor's God Generation every job would be obsolete thanks to their technology.
No one would work and everyone who had ever been alive on the planet would be brought back to life in one way or another.
This was the idea engrained in her through both tradition and fact up until she had found herself enrolled in the University of Euchenor's Department of Alien Anthropology.
At that point, it was like a switch got turned off and she no longer gave thought and praise to the non-existent future generations, her efforts being focused solely on science and hard facts.
Elizabeth felt the inner lining of her suit, the soft material was completely dry.
The shade the rock provided began to increase as its shadow got longer.
In her dehydrated state, Elizabeth went to sleep wondering if the future generations of Euchenor would find her data in the Great Banks one day and replay her life, which ended here under a rock.
They may wonder how it all happened.
Elizabeth wondered this too.
Chapter Twenty-Seven Lyell Inard took an alternate route to the New Selfist encampment in order to avoid coming close to where he had touched down earlier and having to check in with the party he touched down with.
Having gotten little of consequence to report from Ioma and her group, he hoped the same would be true of the New Selfists; however, his academic logic led him to believe otherwise.
Those he came with consisted of the emissaries to the leaders of Euchenor.
Lyell's mission to Antiope had sprung from a red flag in the central computer system of the planet, known as the Unified Network or UN.
This network of supercomputers throughout the planet was based largely on algorithms that charted the various growth indicators of the planet--some of these indicators included technology growth in various sectors and the production of food, as well as the production of people.
It was crucial that the population of Euchenor was kept in an ideal zone where just the right amount of people were on the planet to maximize production and not one too many to overburden the planet's resources.
The indicator had sent a red flag to administrators shortly after the film Antiope became a hit on Euchenor, which had caused many Euchenorians to make their pilgrimage to the planet.
The exodus that resulted from the film sent the UN for a loop when it projected that Euchenor no longer had its ideal population.
This red flag was the true reason for Lyell's mission to Antiope--he was tasked to see just how intent the"settlers" were on staying on the new planet and to gauge how many more may be on their way.
Lyell approached the New Selfists' city that was made up of large, Euchenorian-style structures that had been constructed in rectangles with a particle assimilator.
He made his way through the quiet streets to the center where the large dome with a spiral mass poking its way through the middle stood.
Lyell exited his vehicle at the base of the spiral.
