The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

He did not fight to keep the relationship going and so it ended.
A year later she married a teacher and they had moved to South Africa, 9 years ago now.
Alex had said he would visit sometime and this was it.
The fact was he did not do single holidaying well and it was an easy choice.
He had wondered if it was wise to go and to risk the pressures of meeting up and all that it might entail.
He worried especially about the small part of him that hoped the welcome would be more than just friendly.
He found himself becoming preoccupied with the crumpling of his suit, it was linen and he made a mental note not to buy another one.
He had wanted something that would be cool in South Africa and he was prepared to put up with being cold for a few hours in Heathrow.
But looking tatty was not part of the plan.
His phone pinged indicating a text.
He smiled as he looked at the all too familiar text from his old company AtoZ Fitness the text was headed up 'Fit or What?'
It was a reminder text he sent to all customers and registered prospects.
Well, not 'he' any longer he reminded himself.
His mind quickly went back to that chapter of his life, it was so recent he didn't think of it as the past.
Three months ago the group of three fitness centres he ran as MD was acquired by a rival and he was made redundant as part of the deal.
A good deal for him financially but still a mental wrench all the same.
He had been there over five years and built the business from a low base of two under-utilised centres to three busy and profitable units.
Now he was on holiday, a well-earned rest for six weeks while he gathered his thoughts, and looked for something new.
At 36 and with a good track record behind him he was hopeful of a fresh start when he returned and to be up and running again within six months.
He deleted the text and leaned back, finding the hard wall just behind his chair.
He allowed himself to dwell on the memory of his leaving do and as he waited, scrolled through the mental images, allowing each one to shine bright and clear in his mind's eye.

Chapter 4 Harare Airport The staff at the airport on the 12th March 2007 were used to disruption.
They often saw scuffles as people were pushed into vehicles but today there was a larger than usual presence of police and government hard men.
Some of the outside traders had decided to leave; the air was heavy in anticipation.
A morbid anticipation, not helped by the dampness of the morning and large puddles of water left from the overnight rain.
Outside, Morgan Tsvangirl arrived and with the help of his close friends made his way to the check in desk, his luggage was checked and the pair at the desk worked quickly without looking at him directly.
He tried to take stock of the situation and looked around; he was used to the extra attention and being followed.
He was still suffering from the death of his wife.
A failed attempt at assassinating him had cost her life only 5 days before while he escaped with minor physical injuries but a huge hurt inside.
He was not waiting for the next attempt, he was leaving and he would fight his corner from outside of the country.
He would canvas help on the international stage and then come back and oust President Mugabe.
Or at least that was the plan.
On his way to the departure lounge he was accosted and marched into a nearby office.
The lack of ceremony did not bode well.
They pushed him about and then forced him out of a connecting door, along a corridor and into a store area.
He was then bundled into a waiting vehicle and taken to Machipisa police station in the Highfield suburb of Harare.
There he suffered a beating and was told he was not going to be allowed to leave the country and if he was caught trying again he and the remainder of his family would be killed.
The President had decided to keep his enemies close, he could have them killed at any time while they were within his grasp, letting them go might bring international aid to them and armed resistance to him.
He was under pressure now from the inside as well as the outside.
He was reasonably relaxed about the outside pressure as Zimbabwe had no real assets that could be harvested quickly or have a major impact on the west so he knew they would not invade and oust him.
However, they might support an internal candidate to overthrow him if he gave them a chance.

Chapter 5 Zott the guerilla base camp in Zimbabwe Zott was a small dirt hole in Zimbabwe near the border of South Africa and Botswana, approximately 40 miles from each; South Africa to the south and Botswana to the west.
It was home to two groups; the original inhabitants of bush families scraping their pitiful existence together from farming and hunting.
Although to call it farming was way beyond any usual understanding of the term.
There were about 70 of them barely surviving, along with their livestock and a few dogs and cats.
The other group were the deserters and outcasts from the army, mostly bandits, drug runners and murderers who had taken over one of the few natural water hole villages in the area and set up camp.
They were part time mercenaries and full time low lives, no families, no friends, no loyalties, loud, violent and without conscience.
They called themselves the 'Land Legion Army'; the name came from the promise of land to men who fought for the Government but who were not in the official government.
In fact not many of them had fought for this or any government they were just mercenaries.
There were just over 140 of them but that included 14 children under 10, 38 women, and 14 elders.
The rest being gun carrying fighting men, a very mean, experienced army of 66 murdering cutthroats, a reputation they enjoyed.
Their leader was Gourner,.
He had been accredited with some atrocious acts and gained a nick name of Mubiki (the Shona word for cook or baker), because it was said that he had people put in holes and then set on fire.
Gourner did nothing to challenge these stories and enjoyed the fear and respect they brought him.
He was related to the President as a nephew, as were a lot of the government henchmen related in some way, but he did not sit in any of the luxury of government office.
He was a convicted murderer in South Africa, trained on the streets of Zimbabwe and later in the French Foreign Legion for a brief period, and was allegedly the murderer of two reporters, one British and one American, in 1999.
Since then he had been hiding in Zott with a band of men who knew only this way of life.
He came out of this hide to carry any enforcement requirements of the government which were generally more than just beatings, he handled the disappearance and murder of people who spoke or acted in defiance of government policy or directives.
Although he often took to a number of men, and sometime them all, with him he was always in on the kill himself.
From the air, the camp, this is what the village had become since the arrival of the LLA, was shaped like a 'Y'.
The two tips almost growing out of a huge land mass that rose some 900 feet before slowly falling away to the north over several miles back to base ground level.
There was a radio mast set just outside the snaking road that lead from the top of the land mass to the bottom where the camp huts, tents and vehicles were kept.
The single leg of the 'Y' met a dried up river bed which was bridged by a wooden contraption.
The rainy season was coming to an end and the river bed had already dried out a lot.
As it was only shallow, the surface would soon turn to dust.
In the top area of the two legs were a collection of huts, a water tower, well concealed against the hill background and a couple of old sea containers.
To the east was a fuel tanker trailer, some parked up vehicles, troop carriers, jeeps, a couple of cannibalised vehicles, piles of scrap metal and the helicopter pad.
While to the west was an assortment of huts, tents and evidence of a general living area.
Some of the tents were large and some small, all camouflaged in colour and covered with branches to disguise their shape.
A helicopter flew low overhead and then seemed to drop the last 200 feet, circled the pad once and landed.
It was small helicopter, not military in looks but painted blue and grey.
The pilot stayed inside, the passengers consisted of three men.
A suited man in his forties and two others in military uniform carrying uzi machine guns.
They ducked as they moved from the helicopter to the two men waiting to meet them.
The wind from the propellers produced a welcome blast of cool air giving relief from the gathering heat and humidity.
In the summer a blanket of dust would be thrown up 60 feet into the air but now water droplets were scattered about and a cool breeze kissed their cheeks as the props slowed to a halt.
'Colonel,' he shouted above the engine noise, which drowned the sound of contempt in his voice.
He didn't like the Colonel, he never had but the situation meant he had to go along with passing on the orders from higher up.
They all nodded to each other and moved towards the rock base and the huts.
The two army officers stayed outside and the three men entered a small hut.
A bottle and glasses were on the table and there were six chairs littered around the room.
The visitor sat down and waved away the offer of a drink, the other two helped themselves.
'You drink too much and now we need you sober and thinking straight.
I don't want no cousin of mine pissed on the job you fuck head.'
He had a voice which was much westernised.
Gourner hated the pretence that the Colonel had come from anywhere other than the townships like him.
'Hey you have to be pissed to be here and you know that.
You forget how it is here.' 'Listen man you're been over the border and thieving and murdering and it don't do us no good.
There some heat on about the election so keep it down man.
Do some local thing but no more.
And we need you in about a week to go north and do some stuff to stop people going out on the streets so be ready.
And where is that fucking mast, we can't talk to you with no mast.' 'Yea the mast will be back tonight'.' 'I have to come out here because you got no fucking mast.
Okay I'm going now but you be ready and no shit and that comes from the man himself.
'Did you even know it was down?
I bet you weren't even here?'
He added even though he could see that Gourner was getting upset.
'Yea okay just local stuff for now, we gonna party some soon.' 'You didn't answer were you here when it happened?'
Now normally Gourner would have ranted at that but he heard the question and given his recent activities he was on his guard.
'We were all here no one has been out of the camp for weeks, the rain has had it impossible.
Yes I was here.' 'The road don't look that bad from the air.'
Raising his voice 'Look we don't use the road do we!'
This seemed to satisfy the Colonel.
They parted company, the helicopter throwing up more spray off the ground as it hovered before rising up and away above them and the huge rock and then disappeared.
The Colonel was never sure of Gourner, and it didn't make things easy that he only had this job because Gourner had fucked up.
However he knew that if Gourner was given a job, and he understood it, he always delivered.
Gourner was a feared man, he had proven himself to be totally single minded, even beyond any band of reason.
If he was told to clear an area, he cleared it of man, woman, child and animal.
He got completely immersed in an event without any thought to the consequences.
The radio mast had been damaged when Gourner and some of the men had been returning from one of the marauding trips which he allowed from time to time.
On their way back, drunk and careless they'd run into one of the supporting mast wires and because these were under too much tension it snapped and took out another causing the tower to topple.
It had happened before and he wasn't too bothered, but this time the mistake was evidence of a bigger crime...
Three weeks before Gourner had been visiting a girlfriend when he learned from her of some valuables being taken out of the country by two couriers.
They were going across the border into Botswana and then on to Namibia and away by sea.
She told him how an overland route to the coast had been chosen to avoid as many custom checks as possible and a boat would take the valuables on to Switzerland, how flying out was not an option given the close attention paid to them and how outsiders needed to be used,  introducing a trust issue.
She had no idea who was behind it and he'd thought there might be a downside as the valuables were supposedly about half a kilo of uncut diamonds in assorted sizes including some big ones.
Not exactly easy to sell without drawing attention but he'd decided to go for it and chosen three men to go with him.
They were reliable and as bad as they come but he knew he could trust them.
They'd set out to lay in wait for the two couriers at the border.
* Their escort left them about five miles from the border and they drove their humvee to a well-known lookout point.
It stood high above the borderline and the edge facing the border was crater-like for a half circle, then gradually fell away to the road.
This allowed vehicles to drive right up to the crest and the occupants to get out and peer over the top of the crater wall.
From here they could see the border for miles in either direction and wait their time to cross.
The couriers arrived soon after, the confidence and brazenness of their approach suggesting to Gourner they must be working for the government.
Gourmer and one of his men were already in place on the border side of the crater wall the another two men were also ready, hidden either side of the approaching couriers, dug into the ground with tarpaulin and dirt covering them.
Gourner waited for the couriers to get out of the vehicle and approach the wall.
He himself was pinned with his back to the rock of the wall and crouched down on a small platform, looking at a mirror for the moment they came into view.
He too could see the border was clear and he was not likely to be discovered.
They came into sight and he decided to attack immediately, leaping up and firing at the couriers six times.
On hearing the first shot the other men leapt up and start firing too.
The men either side of the road launched themselves out of hiding but didn't need to shoot, the couriers were down.
Gourner climbed over the wall holding his gun ready to shoot at the lifeless men if they moved.
He made his way to the nearest and checked his pockets and not finding anything he took his knife and cut through the man's belt and shirt.
A small chain was revealed, strung around the man's waist, 'Get the cutters' he ordered moving on to the second man and carrying out the same process.
He stood up and called to his men to cut the keys off the first man and bring them to him.
He walked the short distance to the Humvee and opened the door.
He surveyed the front seats and then the back and then popped the rear door from the driver's position.
* By now his men were with him and they handed over the keys, 'Okay put the bodies in the back.'
He felt the floor carpet and lifted it to reveal a safe compartment.
He tried the keys and one of them worked.
Opening the safe exposed another safe welded into the first.
The other key opened this and he found the cylindrical casing originally for a bottle of whiskey.
He pulled and helped the lid off to reveal a plastic bag full of diamonds.
'Hey man.'
A low and long admiring exclamation beside him brought him back to reality.
'You drive, you two get in.' he ordered.
He took the front seat and they followed the road back to their vehicle parked up in a well-concealed rock cavity some four miles away.
On arriving the men got out and moved away the bushes and debris they'd used as camouflage.
They drove their vehicle out and placed the Humvee into the hole instead.
