Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.'

I'm starving'.
'Yes, but only with roast potatoes' she replied.
'Funny girl' I thought as we departed through the ice rinks door, then I got it - Chinese 'persons', not Chinese 'meals', perhaps she was a cannibal'.
As we stepped outside to join the growing tide of refugees escaping from the Embassy, in the by now torrential downpour, one of my very waterlogged security detail, who was lurking outside the door, quickly threw his waterproof coat over us, and after a quick chat with his wrist watch he steered us to where Russell was now parked.
Fortunately he had 'relocated' to just above the waterline of the lake that was quickly forming around (and later, over) the rest of the cars.
We clambered into the Maybach and after being wrapped in blankets we were handed steaming cups of tea, 'Sugar Miss Paxham?'
Russell asked through the open divider.
'How on earth do you know about Sherri?'
I asked in awe.
'You've been on-air' said another of my detail (who was riding shotgun) tapping her ear piece and waving a small recording device, 'since before that Dragon entered the room', she was obviously the senior one as she was as dry as a bone.
'Please, you are talking about my beloved sister-in-law' Sherri said, and then burst into fits of laughter.
One quick look at my Senior Security Officers (SSO) face and I realised why I had given up making jokes like that to the newbies.
As we sat there waiting for the tea to hit the spot I asked Sherri 'what now, if we go to a restaurant now I think we may need life-jackets'.
'Well it depends on how desperate you are to eat', she whispered, 'me personally, I think we should go back to your hotel, get out of these soaking clothes, have a bath, make love and wait for the storm to pass - this is Madrid - it is open 24/7.
'Do we really have to have a bath?'
I asked.
Someone must have raided a 24-hour boutique as when we finally surfaced, around midnight, Sherri had quite a choice of very flattering outfits to choose from, and had a lovely glow to her cheeks - which had absolutely nothing to do with the bath.
Katie, the still dry SSO offered to have a hairdresser sent up and tentatively explained that she had found a twenty-four hour Chinese restaurant that 'also did roast potatoes' that we could go to if we were still hungry.
--------------- During a brief pillow talk, Sherri had mentioned that Katie seemed 'a bit off' with her on the drive to the hotel, 'have I done something to upset her?' and I explained that I used to have a sense of humour with my new employees, but not all of them saw my funny side, and I briefly explained about the day that I changed from a 'cuddly and benevolent benefactor' to a 'totalitarian dictator' (but a very nice one), 'she was terrified that she would end up on the streets after her comment'.
'But I agreed with her' she continued.
'Yes, but for a split second she saw her world crumbling because of an 'inappropriate' remark'.
'I will have to somehow let her know that I am sorry' then we forgot all about Katie as the sheet moved.
--------------- 'Is this payback time' Sherri whispered.
'YES' I mischievously said, 'and you will eat every single one of them'.
Later, as we came out of the restaurant, Katie came up to us and asked if she could give Sherri a hug, which sort of confused me, but I nodded and as she gave her the hug she said 'thank-you for eating those potatoes.
Whilst you were dining I rang Mr Williams (David) (my Director of Security) to give him a routine update (at two in the morning?) but when I mentioned the potatoes he asked me 'why roast potatoes?' and I explained about the comment you made when you were leaving the Embassy.
When he stopped laughing he explained the 'do you like children?' - 'Yes, but I couldn't eat a whole one' version of the joke.' 'It wasn't a joke' Sherri said with straight face - 'I'm a cannibal'.
I think Katie had kittens on the spot.
The next morning I was woken by the hotels telephone at the ungodly hour of 'before midday' and swore into it.
'Language Andrew, lady present', and turning I saw a vision of tousled loveliness, then I remembered the horde of beauticians that had descended on her before we left for the restaurant, what seemed like a few hours ago, and revealed the true beauty that lurked just below the surface, although I had noticed it sometime before (at the Embassy of course) (naughty, naughty).
Giving her a peck (and then almost forgetting all about the phone) I reluctantly said 'yes, can I be of assistance on this gloriously bright and beautiful morning' into the damn instrument.
'It's still raining, it's nearly afternoon, and the Ambassador is 'fuming' to see you in your 'duplex', David answered.
'Which Ambassador' I innocently asked, 'there are an awful lot of Ambassadors in the world you know'.
'The one that you pissed off big time last night' he replied.
'Oh that one' I answered, that narrowed it down considerably, 'and please don't swear into the phone, there is a lady present'.
'Bollox' he said, 'I will tell him that you will be there shortly', and hung up - he was getting friendlier by the year.
Apparently, as things had decidedly gone 'pear shaped' I was now surrounded by the 'A' team.
'It's your brother' I said, 'back in a mo', and donning a dressing gown I started to climb the stairs to the suites duplex office.
'Wait, I'll come with you and give you some moral support'.
'Not undressed like that I hope, and it will be him that needs the moral support, not me, it was HIS wife that threw ME out', and with each stair I was getting more and more confrontational.
As I have often said before 'I do not do' mornings (or stairs).
As I entered the suites office cum waiting room he jumped to his feet and glowered at me, he was obviously not a morning person either.
'Why didn't you show last night, you ruined the banquet, I will be the laughing stock of the diplomatic corps' he almost screamed, but I was ready for him.
'Let's get one thing straight right now, I had nothing to do with your disaster, I did show up last night, but was promptly thrown out again.
The 'disaster' was caused by your wife and God, 99% your wife, 1% God'.
I hoped that he/she/it wouldn't mind me dragging his/her/its name into this.
'What has my wife got to do with it?
All she had been doing was frantically trying to save the day, and at the same time trying to find my sister, she was the one who had organised the whole unmitigated disaster, but apparently she was skulking away in some corner with a loud mouthed yob', and with that Sherri walked in, wearing my shirt, high heels and not a lot of anything else - a very sexy ensemble, that shut him up.
'Sit down and shut up Jeremy, it's time you had a reality check', she snapped, and he 'shut' and 'sat'.
It was clear who was wearing the trousers today, figuratively speaking of course.
Apparently soon after we had left, Jeremy had had the sense to cancel the function, blaming it on the rain, as reports came flooding in to him from all departments involved in the Banquet (except the car park - the phone was flooded) that everything was going 'tits up', the caterers didn't have enough food, the wine was 'off', the ice had melted, the 'silver service' was plastic, the 'orchestra' was a part time mariachi band (and all three of them were blind drunk), the non-non-slip floor was not only causing chaos but also broken bones, and guests were wandering around the 'secure areas' unabated.
When it was obvious that I was also a 'no show' he did what all good diplomats do in cases like that - and blamed someone else (God).
Jeremy was not really on board with the whole 'reality' thing, until he had listened to the audio recording, three times, then he joined the real world.
Sherri gave him the short (expurgated) version of events, with a little input from me i.e. the invitation that should have been hand delivered by the Sargent at Arms, who would have explained in great detail what was expected of me (it was one of his perks), but had been sent by post instead to save an 'overnighter' expense claim from him.
He would also have 'escorted' me to the banquet in the Ambassadors car and formally presented me to the Ambassador (and her husband!!).
'That reminds me - please can I have my EUR2:95 postage refunded'.
'No' they both said in unison, and then Jeremy reverted to type and went back to the Embassy 'HIS EMBASSY' to have a 'meeting'.
Even though it was Sunday he called a HOD's meeting (Heads of Departments) for four o'clock, 'could we make it?' he asked.
After the briefest of glances I said 'we wouldn't miss it for the world, will Mrs Ambassador be joining us'?
'No, she's not a HOD' he said.
'Neither am I' I thought, 'perhaps I can be the Guest of Honour'.
It quickly became clear to me that not a lot of people liked the 'First Lady', and after about a quarter-of-an-hour that included His Excellency (love/damage limitation - damage limitation/love, it was a 'no brainer' for the consummate diplomat); she had trodden on an awful lot of toes in the short time that she had been in 'residence'.
We were just getting to the juicy bit (the 'social functions account', which was now controlled by Isabel) which even in its un-audited state was obviously sadly lacking in funds after some very 'dubious' items had appeared on the debit side (i.e. diamond necklace from the greengrocer and a new ball gown from the printers - she obviously didn't understand the advances in 'self-auditing' in the E-era) when a 'not quite a HOD yet' slid silently in and handed a message to Jeremy, who swore.
I glanced at Sherri but she didn't bat an eye-lid, I would have to have a word with her later about this blatant discrimination.
Jeremy stood and said 'this meeting is terminated, obviously the whole matter has now been taken out of my hands, I have been 'Summonsed back to London, to await the Foreign Secretaries pleasure', oops.
As the summons skipped the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, (the head of the Diplomatic Service) he was obviously in very deep doo doo indeed.
Turning to the lady on his right he said 'as of this moment you are Charge d'affaires, please arrange for the 'diplomatic note' to be sent to their foreign ministry, informing them of the fact.
'They won't like that one little bit' the gentleman on his left said.
'Tough' said Jeremy (unlike an Ambassador, the host government cannot object to a 'temporary' Charge d'affaires).
'It will certainly put the cat amongst the pigeons' lefty continued; it was obvious to all that he was angling for the job.
'Marion is my excellent Deputy Head of Mission, the fact that she is on long term secondment from the Gibraltarian diplomatic service is of absolutely no concern to me' (the decision to send her here had obviously been made way above his pay grade), 'it will give them something else to try and take their voters' minds off their Economy'.
It was also clear to me that his 'number three' was almost as unpopular as his wife.
I had signed so many 'Official Secrets Acts 1989' over the past few years that I almost had 'writer's cramp' at the merest glance at one, so they didn't lock me up and throw away the key after overhearing the meeting; they gave me a cup of tea.
Jeremy was obviously going around in ever-decreasing circles before his imminent departure, even though the Foreign Secretary was in China - and would be for another four days, but apparently that was a moot point, some miscreants of yore had been kept 'awaiting his pleasure' for years, even after one had inconsiderately died, but he managed to fit Sherri and I in for a quick family chat in front of the fire (in the middle of a Spanish summer? - but it was artificial) before he left, and the first thing that he did was apologise to me for his behaviour earlier that day, then he gave Sherri a cuddle and excusing themselves took her to one side for a moment - most likely for the 'family' stuff, but they were quickly back, obviously they didn't have a very big family.
'As he was being recalled to the UK for an indefinite length of time', he explained, 'it would be 'inappropriate' for his sister to remain in the residence', and before I could offer her my bed hospitality Jeremy asked if he could dump her on me at El Campo, although he put it a bit more diplomatically than that, 'and would it be too much of an inconvenience if she could chat occasionally to him on a secure line, just to keep her up to date with 'things' - I believe your Lady S has one': now that was news to me.
After bidding farewell to Jeremy (after a group 'crossing of fingers' for his trip to London) we made our leisurely way to El Campo (although the helicopter that we were 'leisurely' sat in was going like the clappers), although I couldn't shake off the feeling in the back of my mind that I was somehow being 'used', but what the hell, looking at the new Sherri I didn't mind one little bit.
On arrival we did the usual 'welcome to El Campo' bit, I'm not saying that it was getting slightly 'routine' for me, but if some kind sole had suggested that I make a video, hand it out and pointing them in the right direction, I wouldn't have fired them on the spot, and not surprisingly Sherri had done her homework on the place as well, but I could not help but notice that David was not his normal cheerful self.

Chapter 5
David (and Caroline) had hot footed it up to Madrid as soon as things started to turn pear shaped, and he was getting more and more perplexed by the hour.
Whilst I was in the meeting he had been 'approached' (his word not mine) by a lady of indeterminate origins, not of her nationality, but her employment, and was immediately insulted, 'where do your loyalties lie'.
'With Mr Michael is of course', he had replied (which made me very happy when he told me about it much later on) but it was apparently the wrong answer, and he was then blanked by all and sundry, even the two heavies that he had helped train when they were a lot lighter.
As soon as he arrived back at El Campo he started to do a bit of surreptitious digging into the background of Jeremy and his sister, and quickly his natural 'OCD' went through 'Paranoia' and into 'Conspiracy Theory'.
Jeremy was clearly what it said on the label, a diplomat, who had spent most of his political career in the Middle East.
He spoke two dialects of Arabic passably, with a 'smattering' of Persian and Hebrew, but his Spanish was appalling - so why had he ended up in Spain?
Sherri's history was another thing altogether, as she was 'family' helping out in a crisis there was virtually nothing in official records, except for the occasional bland comment in the odd communique, 'took up his new post, accompanied by his sister' etc., so David, with the help of a few friends started to dig a little deeper, and quickly lost the majority of them, but not quite all.
--------------- Jeremy and his first wife were inseparable, but suddenly, just as he started to find his niche in the Middle East they separated and then quickly divorced - and David could find no reason why - and then his ex-wife ceased to exist.
Rumours circulated in the 'tittle tattle' press for a short while that she had moved abroad (perhaps she had dallied, it was speculated), then she just disappeared off the face of the earth.
Usually divorces cost money, even uncontested ones, but the families modest fortune was untouched by it, in fact according to Itza it started to grow out of all proportion to his income (and what was Sherri living on all this time, they both thought at the same time).
Then the plot thickened, he finally got a look at her passport, or rather both of them.
On arrival at El Campo she had requested a 'manual safe' (that couldn't be 'electronically' tampered with), (but she didn't say anything about it not having a camera inside of it) and as the door closed it picked up a Diplomatic Passport, not only that, but it was a QUEEN'S MESSENGER - COURRIER DIPLOMATIQUE one, issued to Queen's couriers to enable them to take a 'diplomatic bag' (anything from a Tesco's carrier bag to a shipping container) safely through any airport, without it being searched, x-rayed, weighed or otherwise tampered with, then a matter of minutes later she handed him a normal passport, which of course sailed through the scan which every visitor's passport went through, and her fingerprints, which were required to enable her to get through the 'family' doors, didn't show up on any data base when he sent them off a few minutes later, anywhere in the free world, although her passport did have her date of birth in it.
Not a startling discovery except that it confirmed that she was twelve years younger than her brother, who, according to an article written by him in his university magazine, described himself as 'an only child', he was twenty at the time.
--------------- David was in a quandary, he had no hard proof that Sherri wasn't what she claimed, Jeremy might have had a tiff with his baby sister and 'disowned her' in the article, the second passport could be genuine, he knew two members of the 'Corps of Queen's Messengers' and knew that they were 'bullet proof', he wouldn't get anywhere trying to dig deeper, and would more than likely burn any remaining bridges that he still had standing, and realistically that might explain where she fitted into the diplomatic intrigue, but it didn't fit into his 'conspiracy theory', and he was an avid 'theorist' in his own time, so he would say nothing at the moment, and 'wait his time'.
Two days later, when I finally got around to introducing Sherri to Lady S (the floating one) she was suitably impressed with everything, even though she was tied up alongside the jetty, and as we wend our way along the corridors, in and out of rooms/cabins/gyms, and up and down stairs and lifts, I was starting to get 'positional dysfunctionality' (confused at where I was), but as we made our way along a rather bland corridor Sherri pointed at an innocuous door, with no name on it, and said 'that reminds me, I spoke to Robert this morning and the lines are being activated from tonight', and then she seemed to realise that she had made a boob (or two).
One, even I had to think hard about what was behind the door - it was the secret 'junk room' that the Royal Navy had created when Lady S had been press-ganged, and it certainly never showed up on any plans or videos that she may have seen, and two, Robert, AKA my old First Officer, AKA 'Jimmy the One' when Lady S was transporting Royalty around the world, and now my Chief Officer - with designs on becoming her new Captain, as Carol (my Director of all things Nautical) was now doing more and more of her Director'ing on dry land.
To that last end he was on one of the essential courses that he needed to have under his belt before becoming my 'permanent' skipper.
He had been for two weeks - and he would be for another one, and to my knowledge nobody had mentioned his Surname, let alone his Christian name, if he had ever been mentioned at all.
'Did I mention that I met Robert, your Chief Officer, when he was in the 'Grey Funnel line' (Royal Navy), he is the key holder for the room isn't he?' she quickly added.
'Yes' I said, 'and so am I.' 'Oh,' she said, and then quickly changed the subject to something much more appealing, 'is your sea cabin mattress as comfortable as the master cabins?' 'Let's go find out, I said, and forgot all about the 'junk room'.
The next morning Sherri was up bright and early and off in her jogging gear, for two hours, and didn't even break into a sweat, although I didn't realise it, I was swiftly back in the land of the nod - but it was clear that something was going on between her and David.
'What's going on between you and David' I asked her as we sun worshipped later that afternoon.
'I think he thinks I am a spy' she said, and we both laughed.
'Well are you' I said, still LOL ('laughing out loud', not 'lots of love' Mr Cameron).
'It depends if the day of the week starts with a T' she said, and we stopped laughing, it was Tuesday.
Sherri was not a spy 'per se', she was an 'international facilitator', and according to her she used her communicative and social organisational skills to get people talking to each other, or as a last resort acting as a go between.
Not being directly on the pay-role helped, along with her nondescript appearance, and the fact that she understood the 'Middle East' like no other infidel.
'I look on the region not as individual Countries, but regions, tribes and families.
Just one marriage - or a death of an elder in one area can affect the thinking and decision making process over a huge swath of sand, that certainly does not respect man made borders, it could change a militant council or even a government into one open to change, almost overnight.
I have the knack of sensing these nuances and fortunately certain people, in various positions and Countries have noticed this, and I am stating to make inroads into possibly something huge, if we can keep the Politicians out of it for a little while longer'.
'We' I said in disbelief, obviously she meant the 'Royal we', not me.
'Yes - me, you and David'.

Chapter 6
'We' had our first meeting with the outside world in Lady S's special 'Coms Link' room that evening, but before that most of the rest of the afternoon was taken up with Sherri trying to convince David and I that she was not cuckoo.
-------------------- 'As you have most likely guessed he is not my brother, but he is my Uncle, a couple of times removed, but unfortunately 'my Niece' in certain circles means 'my bit on the side', and my 'great niece' would therefore mean that I was 'a right good go'er in bed', so it was more socially acceptable for me to switch Daddies (and generations).
It was only meant to be until Rose, his first wife, was off the scene, but it quickly became clear that it might have 'long term prospects'.
Jeremy was earmarked for bigger things, but with a little digging by 'the team that does that sort of thing' it became clear that she was a closet racist, and the door was starting to open.
She especially didn't like the 'towel heads' of the Middle East, but fortunately (for us) it turned out that she had leaked some very sensitive material to the press and so after a full, frank and meaningful discussion, that made the consequences clear to her what would happen if she interfered in politics this side of the equator, the divorce was a formality and she accepted a complete identity change and relocation to Australia, where she is now something very big on their political scene.
'But why are you in Spain?
David asked 'and not in the Middle East'?
'Because at this stage of the game, being based in one particular Middle Eastern Country would be seen as us being biased to some factions, Spain is sufficiently far away to level the playing field - and fortuitously it is also where you live'.
'Me?' 'Yes, believe it or not, following your escapade off Somalia you came to certain people's attention (just a few million, I thought) and you have, through your actions, then and thereafter, established a reputation amongst them as being an 'honourable man', in circles where 'honour' is considered the highest of high complements.
You are also filthy rich, which carries loads of clout with another circle, and you can pull fabulous birds, which covers the 'dirty old men brigade', so you tick quite a few of the boxes that we need'.
'Is your passport genuine?
David continued.
'Almost, but the Queens Messenger one is, did you get a good image of it with your little Minolta, and I hope you then did the sensible thing and stopped digging once you realised what you were getting yourself into'.
'Yes' David sheepishly said.
'Don't worry, hopefully once things have run their course you will be back on the 'most trusted' list, but you had to be allowed to do 'your thing' unhindered, to get your credibility verified as well'.
We then continued with more and more probing questions but finally we were convinced, but I still had two questions which David politely excused himself from.
'What does your real Christian name start with?
I asked tentatively.
'Don't worry your track record is unblemished' she said, but her fingers were crossed behind her back.
'And where does this leave us?
Was there ever anything between us, or is it all part of the grand scheme?'
After a few seconds pause she quietly said 'there are very few things that happen in a person's life that they will remember exactly where they were, until the day they die, Kennedys assassination, the twin towers, and for me when you took on those pirates.
I, along with millions of other women fell in love with you instantaneously, in that Kevlar helmet and armoured vest, the difference with me is that I have never stopped loving you, and the last few days have also joined that list as well' (and her fingers weren't crossed as she said it).
--------------- I had been in the room before, but it looked absolutely nothing like it looked now.
Boxes and equipment had been moved aside to reveal a bank of screens, but most of them were still in darkness, the only ones that were active displayed the faces of Jeremy and my old friend HRH.
'Good evening Andrew' HRH said politely, 'Mummy is still talking about the Lady S, I sometimes wish I hadn't talked you into loaning her to us' as an ice breaker, and then it was down to business.
Sherri had brought David and I 'up to speed' concerning the Banquet (it was all stage managed to enable Jeremy to be recalled to England for a few months without it attracting any attention - 'even the weather' she had joked - but I didn't believe that part one little bit), and then it was explained to us what parts they hoped we would play - basically they needed our reputations, and El Campo.
With my agreement with the aviation authorities aircraft could fly in and out with impunity, all Chalkie had to do was give numbers on board each aircraft (for search and rescue purposes - if one crashed en-route) and my word that nothing illegal would take place; talking, to my knowledge was not illegal.
Over the next few days El Campo and its staff were given a security check second to none.
Three of the security team were sent on 'routine relocation' to other properties that I had around the globe, they thought they had won the lottery, along with four of the domestic staff.
All were precautionary, their loyalty to me was not in doubt - but when David looked into 'nationalities' his 'conspiracy theory' thoughts kicked in, 'better to be safe than sorry', although our first two guests were, in the greater scheme of things, little fish.
They were disposable assets who were sent to test the water.
They arrived in separate aircraft, which taxied into an empty hangar, and they and their attendant staff (they were limited to a maximum of two - that were on a previously approved list) disembarked, stripped naked, x-rayed, and provided with appropriate clothing of the highest quality (which would then be incinerated in front of them before they left).
They could bring with them only one external hard drive, that I had previously provided (and had been tamper-proofed to the enth degree) with any information that that they may require for the meeting pre-installed - but checked by David, before he plugged it into a new laptop that I provided for them (that was his primary purpose for being here).
Again they would all be destroyed in front of them before they departed.
It was a process that would ensure as close to a one hundred-per-cent guarantee that I could give that all information would be secure, and surprisingly, with virtually no bickering, all parties agreed, and as each 'visit' was limited to six hours there were no 'overnighters' involved.
Both parties were taken to the top floor of Mi Casa by different lifts, for no other reason than to some, it was an insult to be offered rooms/offices on the left as the exited a lift or the stairs, that is why Sherri is so good at her job, it really is the little things that make all the difference.
