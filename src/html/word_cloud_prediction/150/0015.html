The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Suddenly she wasn't hungry anymore.
"I hef your food for you in a minute, da?"
"Da," she agreed weakly.
Kase grinned at her impishly.
"Sorry you asked?"
For answer, Olivia shook her head with a groan and shifted her chair a few inches to one side.
The ventilator return mounted in the ceiling blew a steady stream of cooled air downward, and aside from mussing her hair, it also chilled her skin unpleasantly.
Finding a happy medium between too cool and too warm, she settled in.
"Here is your blini, miss."
The potbellied, dark-haired and dark-eyed man of Russian stock set a plate in front of her with two of the paper-thin pastries.
He said nothing more, but waited expectantly.
She took the hint and picked up one of the blini.
Biting into it, she chewed thoughtfully and then nodded.
The spiced "salmon" was prepared perfectly.
She swallowed.
"This is very good," she reported.
The man nodded, the hint of a smile gracing his dour features.
"I am glad you approve, miss.
If you need anything more, just call."
She assured him she would, and was rewarded with another smile as he turned away.
Much of the ethnic cuisine available for sale in the food vendors slanted heavily toward Russian, Mexican, Spanish, and Italian dishes, along with traditional fare from the northwest continent.
Although the initial settlers had been a fairly mixed bag of ethnicities and cultures, these particular strains and national origins had been particularly well represented.
As humans tend to do, when they arrived on Dusk, they sought out things that reminded them of home, dismissing utterly little things like accuracy in naming them.
The "salmon" in her blini, for example, was actually the steamed, flaky white flesh of a small ground-roving lizard.
She had eaten Terran salmon before and the fish tasted nothing at all like its Dusk counterpart, but she supposed to homesick settlers who were unlikely ever to set foot on their homeworld again it was close enough for comfort's sake.
Kase studied her.
"So, what's the latest intrigue in the DDC?"
There was nothing confidential in the briefing material.
If there had been, Trelawney would have made certain everyone knew it before he proceeded.
In quick, concise sentences she described the substance of the meeting.
Of course, Kase could have just plucked the information right out of her head, had she wished.
That ability had firmly shut the door on any hope she had of joining the DDC.
Diplomats from other worlds would never have tolerated such a huge edge in negotiations if they did not control it, and the multiplicity of dangers perceived and real involved in having someone who could hear the thoughts of another person as clearly as if the person had shouted would create a hazardously unstable base for diplomacy.
However, even if Olivia hadn't been extensively trained in how to thwart such psionic snooping, it would no more occur to Kase to invade her friend's privacy that way than it would for her to whip out a blaster and shoot Olivia.
It simply contradicted everything in her nature.
Kase's eyes went wide.
"So... what are they going to do?"
Olivia shook her head.
"I don't know.
No one seems to want to believe me, but I really think I'm right about this."
"But how would they use it as a weapon?"
She shrugged.
"I have no idea, Kase.
I wish I did.
The only things I can think of..."
she trailed off with a shudder.
"Well, let's just say I can't think of anything cheerful they might do with it."
Kase's eyes widened even more in response to the sudden onslaught of Olivia's negative emotions.
Mental blocks, no matter how rigorous or well-maintained, didn't count for much when one was all but screaming their emotions to the entire immediate universe.
"Um, sweetie," she gasped, her voice pained, "do you think you can calm down a little?"
Olivia cursed and whispered a calming nonsense rhyme.
After a few moments, the anxious anger abated, leaving only a tense calm in its place.
"Sorry about that," she murmured.
Kase smiled.
"No problem.
Happens all the time."
Olivia knew her friend well enough to know she wasn't exaggerating.
"So, tell me what you have planned with Merrick tonight!"
Kase urged.
* * * Merrick smiled at her, showing off the dimples in his cheeks.
"Well, what'd you expect?
You basically threw a baby nuclear bomb onto the table and dared everyone not to freak out about it."
She rolled her eyes.
"Yeah, because apparently I was the only one in that chamber who could see what Terra's up to."
She grabbed Merrick's hand.
"You believe me, right?"
His grin faded a little, but his nod was firm.
"It...
I don't like to admit it, Liv, but it makes sense to me.
Terra already gets all the projectile-resistant fabric it needs at bargain credits, and there's nothing else here with true military applications.
But --" "But how would they use magick in a military situation?"
Olivia finished.
She'd already considered that, but none of the scenarios she came up with were cheerful ones.
Merrick stood silently for a moment, frowning as he mulled over the implications.
The sorrowful shake of his head told her he had come to much the same frightening conclusions she had.
"I hope it doesn't come to that, but this is a negotiation, not a command.
Terra couldn't order us even if they wanted to."
Merrick turned toward her and wrapped his arms around her.
Despite herself, she relaxed into his warm, powerful embrace.
She breathed in the light scent of his preferred aftershave and the slight spicy note of his sweat.
His chest featured only a light tuft of hair right over his breastbone, leading down a fine, soft treasure trail that arrowed under his breechclout.
With an appreciative purr, she pressed her lips to one firm pectoral, just above the nipple, and let her tongue flick out to taste his masculine flavor.
He gasped slightly and pulled her closer.
His hands closed around her buttocks, cradling her in a grip as sturdy and unbreakable as carbonized titasteel as he lifted her up to press against his groin.
"I wanted you so badly the entire time we were in there," he informed her huskily, dropping his lips to hers.
She started to reply, but before she could, he invaded her mouth with his tongue.
It was a shamelessly barbaric male kiss, the kind that no woman has ever needed interpreted since the dawn of the species.
That kiss spelled out "MINE" in letters of flame as he teased her tongue with his.
Olivia squeaked at his possessive turn, but then melted against him, molding her body to his as best she could.
Sometimes she hated Merrick's territoriality, but in the right mood she found it quite arousing.
Between her fear of what the Terrans were really after and her need for comfort, right now she was perfectly willing to let his inner Neanderthal have his way with her.
Her crotch met the bulge between his thighs, sending a silent scream of need through her entire body as he pulled her closer yet.
Even through his breechclout and her attire the hard ridge of his erection stroked at her needy center, coaxing soft waves of damp desire from her.
She wanted desperately to peel off the scanty strands of fabric and take him right here and now, and to hell with who might see it.
As if reading her mind, he kissed her once more with lavish craving and then pulled away.
"We can do better than up against the 'car," he said with a wink.
"Oh... okay."
She tried to stop it, but felt her lower lip pooch out into a tiny pout nevertheless.
He pressed his palm to the entry plate.
The hatch slid silently forward to allow access to the pilot compartment.
This model was designed to carry only two people, but it did so in unquestionable luxury.
With a gallant gesture, he suggested she should enter first.
She scrambled over the side, leaving her backside exposed and vulnerable for a crucial second.
A stinging, playful smack on her rump brought her head up sharply.
"Hey!"
"Sorry."
He laughed with all the impish sincerity of a toddler caught noshing on forbidden snacks between meals.
"But it's all your fault, you know."
She glanced back at him, raising her eyebrows.
"Oh, really?"
"If your ass wasn't so sexy, I wouldn't want to touch it."
She groaned, considering all the delectable ways he had touched her ass in the past.
Another throb of heat shivered deliciously through her lower body.
"So where are we going?"
she asked breathlessly.
"Away from it all," Merrick assured her as she sank into the soft, cream-colored leather of the cabin.
Once she was secured, he leapt the side like a great cat bounding at its prey and landed precisely in the pilot's seat.
In seconds the repulsor-mag engines whirred as they came online and the canopy slid closed with a faint, sturdy clicking sound.
She didn't question his intentions.
Olivia had known Merrick since their youngest school days, and the two had alternately driven each other crazy and away in the way of all young children with an attraction to each other and an aversion to cooties.
Between the birthday parties, the summertime camping trips, and the press of education together, she had learned there was one immutable fact in the universe.
Wherever she went, whatever she did, she could trust Merrick with her life.
He glanced over at her, his eyes glinting purple with the reflected glow of the holo displays.
"We're not going far.
I found a new spot the other day I think you'll appreciate."
He glanced down, moving his hand so close to her own she could feel the warmth of his skin.
Stroking his finger over a smooth metal control in the center console caused the lid to pop up unexpectedly.
She peered inside and saw a green glass bottle reclining wrapped in a soft chamois towel.
"What is it?"
He grinned again.
"It's Merlot, imported from Terra.
I thought we could have a toast and forget about work for a while."
"Mmm..."
* * * Nils Trelawney was not a man at peace.
As he left the DDC assembly chamber, his stomach knotted painfully.
Of all the delegates, he had not expected Olivia to react so violently to the idea, never mind impugning the intentions of the Terrans in this matter.
The difficulty lay in the fact that he could hardly outright gainsay her, because whether she or anyone else realized it, she was precisely correct in her assumption that the given reason was a smoke screen.
He hurried through the corridors, muttering greetings and trying to project an air of rushed, distracted introspection to fend off unnecessary conversation.
There was only one person on Dusk he trusted to advise him in how best to deal with this matter.
Carefully, he avoided even thinking the name.
Long-term exposure to magickstone had different effects for every person, and enhanced psionic capabilities such as the ability to overhear one's thoughts were not unknown.
Despite the fact he had been carefully trained in the skill of mental shielding, it would only take a single unguarded moment to compromise himself and his lover.
His heart felt oddly heavy in his chest, not in an emotional way, but as if his body was trying to warn him something was wrong and getting worse.
He grimaced and massaged his left pectoral, trying to ease a cramp far beneath the surface of his skin.
At the pace he was setting, it was no surprise at all that his lungs labored to extract enough oxygen from the air or that his temples pounded with the first twinges of a migraine.
If all went well, his confidante would make him feel much, much better in only a very little time.
Despite his cardiopulmonary misgivings, parts nearer the equator twitched eagerly at the thought of what such "therapy" might entail.
At the door to his quarters, he touched the sequence of controls that unlocked the portal.
It slid into the wall with a faint hiss, allowing him to peer into the darkness beyond.
In the silvery light from the corridor, he could just make out a form reclining on the bed.
