Four of us jump into the car; it's off to town to buy more booze.
Bottle store finished, boot loaded, Andrew says, "why don't we go for a beer?"
I think that's a great idea, soon we're supping a few beers in The Gray's.
Leaving The Gray's, I drive back to the reception.
I'm definitely over the legal limit, I'm pissed.
The night carries on; people dance and get drunk, including my lovely wife.
Time to go; we've booked into a hotel in the centre for the night.
The honeymoon isn't going to be a passionate one, she's too pissed.
Leaving the hotel, I drop Sylvia back in Queens Park.
I need to drop the car back at the rental shop.
Looking at the clock hung on the wall in the rental office, I decide a cup of coffee at Haefelis would be a good idea.
I walk the two blocks to Haefelis, taking a table outside; I'm soon enjoying a cup of strong black coffee.
My head is a little sore today, too much drink last night.
I sit and watch the world go by, well Bulawayo anyway.
For some reason I think about my observations when I sit here.
There are a few ladies sat drinking, they are all wearing dresses or skirts.
They sit with their legs wide open, I've seen this a lot.
Not very ladylike.
I also see a man on the other side of the road, he's dancing.
Africans love to dance anywhere.
I'd finished my coffee a little while ago, run a few errands, now it's time for a beer.
Falling into a chair in The Gray's, I order a Zambezi, this is the hair of the dog.
I feel shit today, bit of a hangover from last night.
A white man asks if he can sit at my table.
I tell him to go ahead.
He took one beer; we talked for forty five minutes, maybe one hour.
He was an interesting man, he was a miner.
"What do you mine?"
I ask him.
"Gold" is his reply.
He told me he has a small mine; he makes a good living from what he does.
Beer finished he leaves.
He had only been gone a few minutes, when in walks Fred.
He keeps me company for another hour with his comments about the black people.
Six months have almost gone by again; my visa will run out soon.
I don't want to travel over the border; I'm going to try something different.
I'm at the immigration offices here in the city.
I ask if I can see the person in charge.
After a few minutes I'm taken out of the main public area.
I'm told to wait outside this office.
A man opens the door, inviting me in.
He's the top man; he's in charge of all immigration issues over this side of the country.
He asks me what he can do for me.
I explain that I've just got married to my Zimbabwean wife.
My visa is nearly over; I would like to spend more time with her.
No problem, we can give you another six months.
Shit this is too easy.
I notice a photo of Liverpool FC on his wall.
I ask him if he supports them.
He tells me that's his team.
"Everyone here in Bulawayo supports Liverpool.
The reason is Bruce Grobbelaar was goalkeeper of the top team here in Bulawayo, Highlanders" We got onto first name terms; I told him my name was Seb.
He in return told me he was Study.
We got on so well we arranged to go to football together the coming weekend.
Study became a good friend, useful too.
Whenever I needed a new visa, I would just go and see him.
We watched a good few games together at Barbour Fields Stadium.
One game I remember was Highlanders against Dynamos.
These games were tribal, not just sport.
Dynamos came from Harare, their supporter base was Shona.
Highlanders were from Bulawayo, their supporter base was Ndebele.
The stadium was full, so full I couldn't see the game.
I watched the police carrying slabs of beer to a place they were congregating.
One policeman walked around looking very menacing, he was carrying the biggest Knobkierrie I had ever seen.
Hit someone on the head with that and you will kill them.
We decided to leave the game early, Study dropping me off home.
On the evening news I watched a story about the game.
There was trouble at the end.
The footage showed a bank of people behind one goal.
The police are on the pitch, they fire tear gas into this crowd of several thousand supporters.
The supporters squeeze to both ends, leaving a big void in the middle.
They are fenced in, there's nowhere for them to go.
Some people died because of the police intervention.
The supporters were from Highlanders.
I also tried to watch another game between these two enemies.
It was the Independence Cup Final in Harare.
The problem here is the admission is free.
Too many people trying to get in.
I made my way up to the first tier; every stairway going into the stands was full with people.
Every now and then they would all run down, some falling and being trampled.
The police were at the top hitting them with sticks.
I tried another tier, same thing.
I left the stadium with out even seeing the pitch.
Reports later were saying, "6 People Die at Football Match".
I'm very glad I didn't stay.
I asked Sylvia if she would like to visit England.
It was the normal muted response, but it was yes.
A bit of work acquiring a visa, we were soon in a position to go to the UK for six months.
~~~~~
Chapter 22 Back in Africa
We had a good six months in England, I think Sylvia enjoyed it.
I managed to get a temporary job for the time we were there, the money was useful.
Now we're back here in Africa, the beautiful city of Bulawayo.
We had a room in Queens Park but neither of us liked it.
From there we moved into a flat on Twelfth Avenue, it wasn't long before we hit problems.
The person was subletting to us, the landlord found out and we were forced to move out.
Now we have found a shared house in the Suburbs.
The Suburbs is about one kilometre from the city centre, just past the parks.
The streets are lined with trees, the houses are very nice.
The place we're living in is a very huge house, there's a large garden.
We have one room, sharing the bathrooms and kitchen with six other people.
The property is a little run down, the gardens overgrown, but you can visualise what it must have been like.
The garden is full of trees and bushes, no grass, just dust or sand.
Today Sylvia tells me she's missed her period, I tell her to go and take a test.
She phones and makes an appointment at the clinic for tomorrow.
Now we have a mobile phone, I bought it here, a second-hand Nokia.
It's quite new technology here, but the Zimbabweans have taken to it with great enthusiasm.
They're never off the thing; you will see them sat in the bars playing with the keys, writing text messages, talking.
The other problem the mobile as created, is an assault on all of the phone booths in the street.
Now it's very difficult to find one that's not been vandalised.
They say the mobile people pay people to do this and then there are no other means of contact, except the mobile phone.
I'm not sure if it's true, but before the mobile came along the phone booths were in superb condition.
Sylvia's gone to the clinic today; I'm walking into the city for breakfast.
She will meet me at The Gray's for some lunch.
A short stroll past the parks, I reach the city centre.
Few more blocks walked and I'm taking a seat at Haefelis.
I order black coffee and croissant, which soon arrives.
I attack my breakfast; they do make a good cup of coffee here.
I watch the usual happenings, the odd madman walking by shouting and talking to himself.
The beautiful black girls pass, look and give a smile.
I'm joined by Steve.
"What are you doing here?"
I ask him.
He tells me he phoned me, Sylvia told him I was here.
She's carrying the phone, I don't like the things.
He just wants to have a chat.
Drinking our coffee I tell him how things are going on.
I tell him Sylvia's gone for a test, she might be pregnant.
Coffee finished, he needs to go back to work.
I have a few things I want to do before I meet Sylvia.
Arriving at The Gray's, I'm flabbergasted, Sylvia's already here.
I go over to her, I make the comment about African time, it falls on deaf ears.
We make an order for food, I want a sandwich, she wants chicken and chips.
I ask her about the test? it's positive, she's pregnant.
I'm happy; this will be my third child, for her, the first.
We take our lunch, making mental notes between us of the things we need to do.
Time passes, I have found a gynaecologist for Sylvia, he's an Australian.
We will use the government hospital, but not the doctors.
The day of arrival he will attend the birth.
Another new development is the house we're staying in is being sublet, we all have to leave.
I've heard that this place is up for sale; I will go and check it out.
The rains have provided instant lawns in the garden.
Where all of the dust was is now grass, it looks so different.
The borehole is dry, that's one of the jobs that would need to be sorted out if I purchased the house.
If you want to keep your garden all year round, you would need the borehole.
The house never happened, the owner who was selling lived in South Africa, he was a white Zimbabwean.
We made an appointment; he never bothered to turn up.
Weeks later the agent called me, the man wanted to see me about the house sale.
My chosen words to her were, "tell him to put it where the sun doesn't shine".
It was a shame really, what you were getting for PS25,000 was a lot of house.
