"Guy told me the same thing."
"I don't want to be fluff to you, I want a legal and valid marriage to you."
"Let's speak to Neo first.
If he keeps quiet, and we keep quiet..."
"I want him out of your life, I don't want him popping up whenever he pleases, claiming you.
You're with me, and only me, just as I'm with you, and only you.
Get your lawyer to draw up the divorce papers.
We'll meet Neo, and he'll sign them, or..."
panted Daniel.
Martha kissed him gently.
Guy phoned Martha to tell her that Neo would meet her the following evening.
He arrived late at the rendezvous point, and greeted everyone as if he had not kept them waiting.
Martha kept a hold on Daniel's hand to calm him, he was furious.
Guy told Neo that he had to divorce Martha.
"I was never married to her," he said.
"Neo..."
said Guy.
"My name is Alfred."
"We all know you're Neo.
We've had three separate investigators look into you, you're Neo," said Hutchins.
Neo looked at Martha malevolently.
"Why did you have to recognise me?
Why couldn't you have been like everyone else?"
he demanded.
"Why did you leave me with a stranger?"
she asked.
"You bored me."
Daniel gasped.
"You could have divorced me.
It would have been cheaper than a face lift," said Martha.
"True, but I wanted to be someone else more than I wanted to be divorced."
"I don't understand."
"I got tired of being Neo the engineer, with the parents I had, and the brother I had.
I wanted a life lived alone, with no wife, or other family crowding me.
I met Alfred in Cape Town.
He was alone in the world and wanted a family.
We decided to swap lives."
"You could have done that without endangering Martha by leaving her with a stranger," said Daniel.
"He loved you, Dan.
I found you suffocating, he saw you as the father he never had.
Didn't you become closer in the past few years?"
"Yes."
"It was Fred, not me.
Martha, he found you as uptight as I did, that's why he had extracurricular activities."
"If I was that boring, why did you marry me?"
"I wanted to marry out of my league, and you were that, Martha, way out of my league, with your almost royal ancestry, and the wealth you were born into, and inherited.
The social stuff I could handle.
But you were so needy, with your hugs and kisses.
It was enough to drive a man to hang himself."
"Why did you never tell me to stop?"
"It was novel for a while, and once it got boring, I didn't care enough to tell you that you bored me."
Martha nodded, then she smiled.
"Are you alright?"
asked Daniel.
"I can't believe I never saw Neo for who and what he is," she said.
"I was always thankful for that.
If you'd seen me for myself, instead of who you wanted, you'd never have married me," said Neo.
"Enough chitchat, sign the divorce papers," said Daniel.
"I'm signing nothing, timer."
Daniel leapt out of his chair and choked Neo.
Everyone gasped, and stood.
Guy and Hutchins tried to prise Daniel off Neo, and failed.
Martha stood behind Neo and put her hands on his choker's face.
"Daniel, Daniel, please don't kill him.
I want you home with me, not in prison," she said.
He did not seem to hear her.
She kissed him, and she was relieved to feel his hands on her forearms as he returned her kisses.
"I can't breathe," said a muffled voice.
Martha realised that Neo was squashed between her and Daniel.
She moved to Daniel's side and drew him away from Neo.
She could hear Daniel, Neo and herself panting.
"Sign the divorce papers, Neo, or I'll have you arrested for impersonation.
With all the evidence I have, you won't see the light of day any time soon, especially considering all the insurance fraud you're involved in," said Daniel.
Neo looked at him with hatred.
"Where am I supposed to sign?
On the air?"
he demanded.
Guy presented him with the papers, which he signed without reading.
"Look them over, Laurens," said Daniel.
Guy looked the papers over.
"Everything is in order," he said.
"Neo, get out of here, and stay away from my wife.
If you come near her..."
said Daniel.
"You'd better go," said Hutchins.
Neo gave Martha a last look, and left.
Daniel followed him.
"I was right," said Guy.
"About what?"
asked Martha.
"That man would kill for you."
"You noticed that too?"
said Hutchins.
"First time I saw them together."
"Me too."
"What reasons are given for my divorce from Neo?"
asked Martha.
"Abandonment and irreconcilable differences," said Guy.
"Daniel will see to it that the divorce is processed soon, he wants you married to him," said Hutchins.
Martha nodded.
Daniel returned.
"Are you alright, Martha?"
he asked.
"Yes."
"Victor just reunited with his brother."
"When?
How?"
"I told him to come here, then I hurt Neo into admitting the truth to him."
"Oh.
Was that wise?"
"Yes, that way, Victor spills his anger on his brother, not on you.
You've had enough pain from that family.
Let's go home," he said, taking her hand.
He made gentle love to her, that left her crying, touched deeply, physically and emotionally.
He held her tight all night, and they both called in sick the following day.
They spent most of the day in bed, making love or watching movies, or playing games.
Next morning at breakfast, Daniel gave Martha a long look.
"What is it?"
she asked.
"Are you alright?"
"Yes."
"Neo's words didn't upset you?"
"Not as much as they would have done if you hadn't been with me."
"Do you want to talk about Neo?"
"No.
Do you?"
"No.
I have to get to work.
Have a good day," said Daniel, then he kissed Martha, and left.
She called in sick, and went to see Dimpho.
Dimpho held her tight.
"Thank you, for the food, the nanny and the nurse before her," she said.
"You already thanked me."
"I want to be sure you know I appreciate you."
"I do.
How are you?
I hope you're getting enough rest.
You need to get back to work soon."
"Victor suggested I stay home for a year."
"No." "Martha!"
"Victor has problems, you need to have your own source of income."
"Why do you say that?"
"I'm buying food for your family, the family needs another source of income."
"You're right."
"I don't believe in secrets between couples, but I don't think Victor needs to know that I was here."
"I wasn't going to mention it.
He gets upset when he hears your name, and all because you make my life easier."
"I have to go."
"Thanks for coming by."
"Tell me if you need help, with anything."
