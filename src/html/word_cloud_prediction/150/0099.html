This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

Certainly one possible explanation for werewolves, and tales of magical transformations.
His grin broadened.
"Well, I told him the were-people of the Earth had a pact to help each other, and that you were in trouble already, for letting someone like him know we exist.
I told him you were were-mer, and that I--" She couldn't suppress the snort of laughter that came.
"Were...mer?
That's..."
She laughed.
"That's brilliant."
"Thank you.
I thought so....
Anyway, I told him I was a were-tiger" "A were-tiger?"
She couldn't help the grin that came.
The man certainly was inventive.
The grin evaporated when he shrugged and added, "I think he bought it....
We'll have to see what happens, and be careful."
"And his camera?"
"In the cabin.
It's a digital model.
I not only erased the pictures, I took new ones over them, then erased them, too, to be sure there's nothing he can recover.
I said you'd leave the camera at the front gate when you went to work."
"Umm...can I interrupt for just a second?"
Skip Daws stood on the deck of the Harpfish, drying his hair with a towel.
When he saw he had their attention he said, "When you're done talking do you think you might let me in on the big secret?
Like what the hell is going on with Ann and her..."
he glanced around, apparently checking for eavesdroppers, before saying, "Well, whatever that was that I saw?"
She turned to David, in question.
He gave a little shrug, as though to say, "It's up to you."
So she said, "Come have breakfast with us Skip, and I'll tell you about it."
Everyone else seemed to know, or at least find out about it, so what was one more?

Chapter 12
David took the boat out of the slip before they turned in for the night, to continue his drift data-gathering, and to ensure that neither Jones nor any other reporter could find them.
A quiet evening followed devoted to conversation on no particular subject.
She exchanged personal anecdotes, talked politics, and even argued religion without coming to blows.
He showed interest in virtually everything, and had a way of expressing things that seemed to anticipate, and answer her every question.
As teacher he must be an especially good one.
Unfortunately, his profession, other than the generic term, oceanographer, was a subject they had yet to cover.
She made a mental note to ask.
Breakfast was a silent affair.
And that continued, as they headed for the marina.
Tonight she would sleep at Carla's apartment.
As they approached the dock she leaned back against the pilothouse's front wall, enjoying the sunshine and reliving the events of the previous morning, with the reporter.
If only things wouldn't keep getting more and more complicated.
Jones was the first of many.
So, she now had to suspect anything and anyone out of the ordinary.
One of the prices of fame, it appeared, but getting used to it would take time.
David knocked on the pilothouse window to get her attention, then called, "I'll need you at the bow lines.
I'll get the stern."
They were the first words he'd spoken since "Good morning."
Her decision to leave disappointed him, obviously, but living on the boat wasn't a viable option, for several reasons, not the least of which was the effect he had on her.
Looked at in retrospect, last night, with conversation, wine, and coffee had been far too comfortable a way to spend an evening.
The engines rumbled at just above idle speed as they entered the marina and worked their way to their slip.
She stopped at the hatchway before going to the bow, to make ready to secure the lines.
"David?
I'm sorry I've made you unhappy."
"Not your fault," he called, waving the comment away.
"It's just that I've come to enjoy having you here.
I hadn't really known how lonely I was before you came on board.
I guess I was too busy, and too worried about running out of time to think about it.
It's nice to have someone to talk to, though."
Unfortunately, his back was to her so she couldn't see his face.
But taking his attention from maneuvering the boat this close to the slip would be foolish.
He waved her to the deck, saying, "Go.
We'll talk later."
As she walked to the bow the engines ran up the scale for a moment.
The boat came to a stop, then began to back into the slip.
His seamanship was impressive.
The old trawler wasn't terribly agile, but he threaded it between the pilings, compensating for wind and current, until the stern was inches from the dock, then stopped with a tiny burst of power.
She reached out with the gaff to snag the windward mooring line and pull it in, then hauled on the line till the boat was centered in the slip before she tied it off.
She secured the lee side, as well, before making her way to the stern, where David was finishing up.
"I wish I could stay.
I've enjoyed being here.
And I liked our talks, but..."
She shrugged.
So much unsaid.
So much she couldn't say.
"But it won't work with me not in port most of the time.
I know that, but it's..."
He finished securing the line and turned to face her, leaning against the stern trunk.
"I know.
I also know I'm acting like a kid, so I'm sorry.
I don't handle disappointment well, I suppose."
"Who does?"
He smiled at that.
He had such a sweet smile that it never failed to cheer.
"Who indeed?
But the past few months have been a bit out of character for me."
He waved an arm, encompassing the boat and the sea around it, saying, "I love the sea, but this kind of thing isn't exactly what I do for my life's work."
That brought up the subject she'd been planning to ask about, so she said, "What exactly do you do for your life's work?
I know you trained as a marine biologist, but that's all.
We've been so busy discussing my problems that you never really told me about yourself."
"Don't you have to work?"
She smiled.
"Yes, but as the star of the show I do have a few perks, so come have another cup of coffee and we can talk."
"Okay," he said, taking a sip of coffee.
"I graduated from Boston University, and went on to get my doctorate at M.I.T., which has a partnership with Woods Hole.
I took one trip there and fell in love.
I was teaching undergrads at M.I.T. when the job came up at WHOI, which I sort--" "WHOI?"
"Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
Sorry.
It's in Falmouth Mass."
When she didn't react to that he added, "It's across the bay from Chappaquiddick, on Martha's Vineyard."
That clicked.
"Ahh...it's a school?"
"A bit of everything.
Woods Hole is he center of the universe for things oceanographic."
"Then you're a teacher?"
That had been her first guess.
"That, too, but my real interest is something that probably won't excite you."
"Try me."
"I'm interested in sensory mechanisms, physiology, and lately I've taken a sidetrack into holographic imaging."
That perked up her interest.
"Really.
That last sounds like something I would like to learn more about.
But that's for later.
Right now I want to know how you went from there to treasure hunting."
That rated a laugh.
"That's easy.
I wanted to be a treasure hunter long before I thought about biology.
Now it's a hobby.
I let it slide for the past few years, though, until Jennie was diagnosed.
It looked like a way to help, so...well, here I am."
He took her cup, along with his, and carried them to the sink, where he poured them out, saying, "And here you go.
I could talk all day.
But I have to get to work and so do you."
Apparently, he didn't want to talk, and she respected that by saying nothing, but as they got in the car, he said, "I'll tell you the rest tonight."
"Tonight?"
He grinned.
"It's unreasonable of you to expect me to do this cold-turkey, so to speak, so we're having dinner.
Okay?
You can bring Carla, if you want."
He headed for the deck, taking the suitcase that contained her clothing.
"Well..."
"Just call me when you're ready," he said over his shoulder.
"You can leave your stuff in the car's trunk.
That way I'll pick you up and deliver your things at the same time, and you don't have to worry about them during the day."
That made sense, so she thanked him and followed as he stepped onto the dock.
"Do you have a ride to Carla's place, or shall I pick you up at the park for dinner?"
Efficiency appeared to be his watchword today.
"Pick me up at Carla's place.
One of the maintenance men takes her up and back every day.
He said I could come, too."
His eyes met hers over the car roof, as he said, "Well, when you're ready, call, okay?
And I meant it about Carla being invited.
Trina, too."
"Umm....
Okay, I suppose.
I'll ask."
But she wouldn't.
She knew that, but wasn't sure why.
