That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

She folded the parchment into a small square, and thought again about her resolution.
Biting her lip, she tugged her mother's battered silver ring from her finger and, before she could change her mind, dropped it into the paper pocket she had created.
She sealed the envelope with beeswax from the candle.
That ought to make my damnable aunt happy, she thought angrily.
Half an hour later, just as the Lamps were rising, Hax was riding swiftly out of town, northbound on the Nordvej, heading for Ganesford, and Dolin's Pit, and Ellohyin, far upriver; and then Bitterberg, and the mountains, and beyond.
She had looped strips of torn cloth through the bridle and girth-strap buckles of her mount's tack to keep them from jingling as the horse - a spirited, midnight mare - trotted along the night-brown strip of the high road.
She'd left the letter with the innkeeper, with instructions to deliver it to the half-elf the next day.
Hax hoped that Breygon would forgive her for stealing his horse.
Chapter 3  Frideswide
Hax's journey up the Nordvej was tiring, but without incident.
The road, well-maintained in the summer, was firm and wide, with sound, stone-arched bridges and regular towns.
It seemed to unroll like a ribbon beneath her mount's hooves.
The only denizens of the countryside she saw were the four-legged ones that populated the fields and vales, and the two-legged ones who tended to them.
She rode alone, avoiding passersby, and keeping her hood up and her sword concealed beneath her cloak whenever she passed through a town.
Outside of the cities, elves were not a common sight in Zare, and a maiden of the Third House - especially of the Duodeci, if there were anyone about astute enough to recognize her for what she was - alone, horsed and armed, would be unusual enough to excite comment.
She wanted to avoid that.
She had no difficulties with her new steed.
Breygon's mare took to her far more readily than its master had done, bearing Hax's lesser weight without complaint.
In further contrast to the half-elf, it proved to be even-tempered, tranquil, and biddable.
She found herself warming to the creature, and wished that she knew its name.
In the days following her brief sojourn with Breygon and his turma, she managed to avoid company.
Neither Ganesford nor the mining town to the north of it - a dismal place with the charming name of 'Dolin's Pit' - had anything much to offer in the way of accommodations.
Ellohyin, though, which she reached four days after leaving Bornhavn, was a different story.
She arrived in the great city on the Stjerneflade in the wee hours of the first day of Lastreap, the day that marked the end of summer and the beginning of autumn.
She slept a single night at a likely-looking establishment called 'The Shades of Shadizar'.
This proved to be a poor choice of venue, as it seemed to come alive after dark, keeping her awake with loud music, revelry, and feminine squeals.
Evidently there was more going on behind its many doors than a cursory inspection suggested.
As a result, Hax left Ellohyin the following day, more exhausted than when she had arrived.
She would have preferred to stay another night to recover her strength, but the possibility of snow in the mountain passes preyed increasingly on her mind.
She bought a long cloak of thick brown fur from a merchant in the city's grote markt, replenished her supply of hard bread and cured meat, and pressed on.
Three days' hard riding brought her to Bitterberg, a little over two-score leagues north of Ellohyin.
Originally named for the hops that grew in profusion on the hillsides about the city, the town's economy - as Breygon had recounted to her - had long since been overtaken by the mines that lined the hillsides, turning the settlement into a bastion of the northern iron market.
Vast, low-sided barges plied the tributaries, poled downstream by sweating crewmen, loaded to the gunwales with ore.
They were emptied swiftly, only to be towed back upstream - full of men, food, equipment and ale - by labouring teams of horses.
The Stjerneflade was wild and vicious here, fed by rivers and creeks descending from the Dragonspine Mountains.
The whole of the city's commerce went downstream, to Ellohyin and beyond, even to Vejborg on the coast.
There was no travelling the great river above Bitterberg.
It was a busy, bustling place, filled with all manner of denizens; the only requirement for admittance appeared to be a full purse, or failing that, a willingness to work.
In addition to the ubiquitous humans, she saw dwarves, halflings, gnomes, and even a few elves.
She also passed what could only have been an ogre, although she had never seen one in her life, and detoured widely around a filthy work crew consisting of unidentifiable creatures bearing fangs, fur, and foul expressions.
Hax did not linger in the city, although she did part with enough gold to buy a satchel full of biscuit, jerked meat and dried fruit.
She tried the wine, grimaced, decided that it was unwise to trust the local vintage in a place that didn't grow grapes, and settled for a couple of corked bottles of distilled spirit.
It was lighter than ale, and she could always mix it with water.
And it could do double duty for medical purposes.
The next day she struck out for the Whitestone Pass, setting a stiff pace.
There had been a decided nip in the air when she rose, and as she cantered past the fields, she saw that they were full of labourers, getting in the last of the hay before the first frosts struck.
The axes of woodsmen rang, and she passed many barns packed with lowing, panicked kine, as the people slaughtered, dressed, smoked and salted the meat that would see them through another Bjerglands winter.
She dug her heels into the flanks of her mount.
She had no intention of letting the snow find her still climbing the pass.
Breygon's horse, at least, seemed to be up to the challenge, and responded to her proddings with good humour.
She was going to have to give it a name.
The transit of the pass was easier than she had expected.
The weather cooled considerably as she mounted the flanks of the mountain, but the skies stayed clear.
A few brief bursts of chill rain ensured that she stayed damp and miserable, but it wasn't enough to soften the road.
She spent the final day of Lastreap in a cliff-side hostel perched precariously at the apex of the pass, paying a pretty penny for rough fare and a simple cot.
She was glad to do so; although the snow had not yet begun, the wind was high and bitter.
And the fire allowed her to dry her clothes.
She started down the north side of the pass the following morning, spending a miserable night huddling in her damp fur cloak beneath a rude shelter of hacked-down evergreen branches, and reached the borders of Dunholm in the first week of Ars-Waning.
Her first contact with that bucolic land was Menyra.
Like Bitterberg, it was a mountain town very much defined by its key exports - in this case, timber and pitch.
Vast pine forests covered the north-facing slopes of the Dragonspine Mountains, and Menyra supported the loggers who limbed and felled the trees, and either rolled them down the hills or rafted them down the rivers for rendering in the giant fieldstone ovens south of the city.
The rising smoke blanketed the place like a permanent, putrescent fog bank.
Hax rode through the unpaved streets quickly, eyes streaming, one of her precious bandages bound tightly over mouth and nose.
Happily, the northern, downhill side of the city boasted cleaner air and better roads.
Her nostrils thereafter went unassaulted, except by the occasional caravan carrying wagonloads of oozing pitch barrels downhill to the trading ports on the Broadwater.
She reached the largest of these port towns, Rolling River, a few days after leaving Menyra.
The place had a whimsical look about it.
It had been built half on piles driven into the river bed, and half in the rolling hills surrounding the water.
Men and Halflings, sons of Esu and Nosa, seemed to occupy it in equal numbers, chaffering, gambling, drinking, working, singing or just chatting amicably on street-corners.
In contrast to the busy (if noisome) industry of Menyra, an air of casual sloth seemed to pervade the place.
Hax suspected that a great deal of bustle lay behind that facade, and that at least some of activity that appeared purposeless must have been productive.
The ostentatious character of the inhabitants' clothing and the brightly-painted facades of the businesses seemed to indicate a certain amount of comfort, if not outright wealth.
Hax found that she was receiving an undesirable amount of attention, and soon realized why.
She hadn't seen another scion of the Third House since leaving Bitterberg.
Evidently, her folk were few and far between in this northern valley kingdom.
Upon noticing this, she raised her hood, and kept it up.
Desperate for somewhere warm and dry to sleep, Hax stayed overnight in a riverside hostel called 'The Harriers'.
Once again, this proved an unwise choice.
The establishment was evidently the favoured watering-hole for the lowbrow celebrants of Rolling River, and had shaken noisily and mercilessly until the wee hours of the morning, exuding the clangour of unskilled but enthusiastic music, the thunder of dancing, and raucous, drunken shouts for "More ale!"
I suppose I'm destined to lie in ditches if I want to get any sleep, she sighed.
She made a mental note to avoid all such places in the future.
Three days later found her a hundred leagues upriver, searching for an appropriately-sized inn in the city of Greatwaters, the halfling capital of Dunholm.
The proportion of Halpinya in this place was much higher than in Rolling River; there were few humans to be seen, and no elves of any description.
The occasional gnome mixed freely with the crowds, though, and she saw the odd dwarf here and there.
She thought they were hill dwarves, although she wasn't sufficiently acquainted with the Dweorga to be certain.
Taken altogether, apart from the absence of any of her own kin, it was one of the most cosmopolitan places she had ever seen.
Indeed, she thought - just for a moment - that she saw what she would have sworn was one of the fey folk.
She hadn't seen any of that rare, exquisitely shy breed since her last trek through the deep, ancient forests of Eldisle.
The halflings proved something of a challenge.
They clustered fearlessly around her mount's stamping hooves, dodging, weaving and courting death as they presented a profusion of goods for her inspection.
Had she been riding Torris instead of Breygon's far more sedate mare, she would have quickly been surrounded by blood-soaked sod and pathetic, trampled bodies.
Her new steed, however, bore the distraction with nothing more than an irritated flaring of her nostrils.
Hax was certain that her own expression was something similar.
She had to admit that the array of goods was impressive: woven carpets, brightly-coloured clothing (all of it clearly too small for her), hats, belts, boots, silver cutlery, earthenware teapots, horn combs, pewter tankards, tiny pocket knives...the list was all but endless.
She felt as though she had stumbled into a flock of miniature merchants.
Hax tried to wave them away politely, but this proved a futile gesture given the persistence of the small folk.
Eventually she gave up, spurring her mount and continuing down the street at a quick trot, praying that Breygon's horse was compassionate and dextrous enough to avoid the scampering mass of salesmen.
As it turned out, she needn't have worried.
The Halpinya were apparently used to big folk trying to ride them down, and danced nimbly out of her way.
They heckled her mercilessly in at least six different languages as she cantered off.
Night was falling, and she was beginning to despair of finding an inn that she could stand up in.
Rather than risk another unpleasant night out-of-doors, Hax reined in at a suitably-sized tavern at the western edge of the town - the 'Pickens Hovel', a low, robust establishment built entirely of close-fitted fieldstone, and sporting a weather-beaten sign that bore crossed mining implements and a legend in the - to her eyes - indecipherable dwarven script.
The lintel of the door was precisely at the same level as her forehead, but it would have to do.
It was a good foot higher than the ceiling of every other place she had thus far tried.
She entered, blinking against the sooty lamplight, and sought out the proprietor.
This worthy, an obvious hill dwarf with an eye-patch and a leather jerkin stained with smoke and bacon grease in equal proportions, introduced himself as one Gareth Pickens.
Eyeing Hax carefully as she approached, he reached for something concealed under the bar.
Then he seemed to think better of it, and placed his hands carefully on the scarred wooden surface before him.
Hax smiled broadly, taking his wary regard as a compliment.
When she inquired about a room, he snorted derisively, pointing towards the hearth, where three shapes - dwarves, by the look of them - were already huddled in blankets, snoring like a trio of bellows.
Hax nodded resignedly, and tossed Pickens a handful of copper.
This bought her a filling and surprisingly tasty dinner (if over-salted; the dwarves, she recalled Sylloallen telling her once, over-salted everything), a mug of ale that she was quite unable to finish, and a blanket that was, if ragged, at least clean.
This she folded carefully into a make-shift mattress, covering herself with her own blankets.
Her saddlebags she placed under her head, with her bow and sword by her side.
Between a hard floor, a smoky fire and snoring Dwarves, Hax expected to lay awake most of the night.
She was asleep within minutes.
Ally's mother was none too happy with her daughter's new career.
As soon as she learned that Sylloallen had returned with the girl from the Draeywood, she summoned them both for an immediate and thorough dressing down.
That, she realized the moment the miscreants entered her exquisitely-appointed and scrupulously clean day room, was an error of judgement.
When the bedraggled pair were admitted by a handmaiden (who prudently fled, closing the door firmly behind her), all that Alrykkian could do was goggle at them in disbelief.
The warrior and the girl had spent five nights in the forest.
Although they had managed to find a mountain stream in which to bathe, they remained filthy beyond description.
Sylloallen was still clad in his everyday garb, but now, instead of being barely-suitable attire for the palace, his tunic, shirt and cloak were fit only for the ash heap.
The right leg of his breeches was blood-soaked and torn high on the thigh; dirty white cloth, stained with more blood, showed underneath.
His boots were scuffed and worn, and the left one was missing a heel; and there was a glaring, painful-looking contusion under his right eye.
The girl, however, looked far, far worse.
Rykki was hard-pressed to recognize her daughter at all in the filthy, grime-encrusted guttersnipe that stood before her.
The girl's hair was smutty and tatted, and the whole sodden, mud-caked mess had been tied back with what looked like either a piece of vine or a boot-lace.
She was wearing - over the rags of what had once been a costly gown - a motley collection of what appeared to be uncured hides, and she was unshod.
Her bare legs were criss-crossed with cuts and scrapes, and there were dark circles etched under her eyes.
Her arms were bare, and a cut on her left bicep was bleeding sluggishly.
The duchess took a deep breath to calm herself.
That, too, proved to be a mistake; the pair stank like the castle midden on a summer afternoon, and her inhalation quickly became a gagging cough.
The girl looked worriedly up at her mentor.
Sylloallen made a calming gesture.
"Your Grace," he began, "Let me explain.
The duke..."
"Bother the Duke," Alrykkian cut him off.
'Bother' was not the term she used.
"You're rusting, Syllo.
And what on earth happened to your eye?"
The knight glanced down at his mailshirt, and winced; sure enough, the fine links were beginning to turn an angry orange.
"My lady, your lord husband -" "I'll deal with 'my lord husband' later," she snapped.
"And you, too.
For now, go take a bath.
And do something about that ridiculous bruise," she added waspishly, with a wave of her fingers near her own eye.
"I thought you fellows were able to manage with that sort of thing."
Turning to her daughter, she said incredulously, "Are you naked under all that...that...mess?"
"Not entirely, mother," the girl replied, exhaustion helping her to remain calm under her mother's withering gaze.
"Sylloallen took a bad goring from a boar.
