The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

"You could be wrong," Toshiro pointed out wanting to get the last word in.
Those light brown eyes stared at him with challenge.
Jason wanted to reach out and smooth out the small frown lines creasing Toshiro's forehead.
Instead of keeping up their silly argument, he chose another tactic.
"Do you always get this cranky when you're out fishing?"
Toshiro leaned back in his seat, and crossed his arms against his chest.
"I don't fish."
Well, that wasn't a yes or no.
Did that mean that Toshiro had fished before?
Toshiro's past intrigued him.
Jason wanted to know what had put that troubled look in Toshiro's eyes.
"What do you do for fun?"
"For fun?"
Toshiro repeated as though it was a trick question.
"I like fishing for fun.
I have a loft over the shop in town.
Some days I close the shop early, so that I can watch football on the flat screen in my living room or Sean and I go play pool at the local pub."
Jason smiled at Toshiro.
"What do you like doing?"
Toshiro's gaze slid away from him and instead roamed their surroundings.
They'd stopped the boat in the middle of the lake.
Jason liked the endless feeling he got sitting in this particular spot.
Surrounded by trees, the water an endless sheet on all sides, it humbled a man to be so small in the vast beautiful setting.
Watching Toshiro take in the scene quickly became his most favorite thing to do just then.
Toshiro dropped his gaze to his lap and stared at a spot on his black jeans.
When he spoke, painful nostalgia tinged his tone.
"I--uh--I used to have a bicycle when I was around eight.
I would ride it to all kinds of places.
I loved the feel of the wind on my face."
Toshiro smiled ruefully.
"I haven't ridden a bike since then."
"Why?"
Toshiro shrugged and shook his head.
"Lots of things changed, no time to run around acting like a carefree child."
Jason put his beer in the cooler on the floor of the boat and sat up in his seat.
"You can always ride again.
I'm sure there are a couple of bikes in the garage."
Toshiro lifted his head to meet his gaze.
"Are you always this positive?"
"No."  Jason took Toshiro's right hand in his.
"I'm only this way around you."
"You don't say?"
"Can't help it, you have this tragic air about you.
You make me want to dispel it."
"Jason...."
Jason moved to the edge of his seat, so that he could close the distance between him and Toshiro.
Their gazes held, Toshiro's full of uncertainty.
Jason grabbed on to Toshiro's open jacket and pulled him closer.
He bent his head to take Toshiro's lips in a warm soft kiss.
He lingered when Toshiro leaned into him.
Tasting Toshiro's full bottom lip, his tongue tracing, teasing, he kissed Toshiro again, this time Toshiro responded, kissing him back.
Jason pulled back slightly, and met dazed light brown eyes.
Relief flooded him when Toshiro didn't protest, or push him away.
Instead, that honeyed gaze he was starting to love fell on his lips.
He read longing on Toshiro's face, that knowledge heated his blood.
It was good to know he wasn't the only one caught in this attraction.
"I've wanted to kiss you since that day in the hospital when you told me you weren't good for me."
Cupping Toshiro's face between his palms, he kissed him again.
"I wanted to kiss you and tell you I didn't care."
Toshiro closed his eyes.
"You should care, Jason."
"Why?"
"Because."
Toshiro opened his eyes and tried to move away.
Jason wouldn't allow it, so he dropped his gaze.
"I wasn't kidding when I told you I wasn't good for you."
Jason kissed him again: a frenzied, needy kiss that had them both breathing hard.
When he broke off, he pulled Toshiro into his arms.
Putting them both in an awkward position on the boat, but he didn't care.
"Let's make a deal," he said against Toshiro's ear.
He closed his eyes when Toshiro's arms slowly moved around him and tightened.
"What kind of deal?"
Toshiro asked, his voice muffled by Jason's windbreaker.
"For as long as you're here with me, you'll stop putting yourself down."
Jason rubbed Toshiro's back over his leather jacket.
"Whether you're good, or bad, it doesn't matter to me."
"What happens when I leave?"
Jason sighed.
"Don't think about leaving either."
Toshiro chuckled.
"Are we planning an imaginary world here?"
"Maybe," Jason said wishfully.
"I want to hold you like this for as long as I can.
So, just say yes to what I say and go along with it.
Deal?"
*** Eyes closed, his face buried in the curve of Jason's neck, Toshiro took in a deep breath, filling his lungs with Jason's enticing scent.
His heart squeezed tight, so tight, it was painful.
"Toshi?"
Jason prompted in his ear.
Toshiro opened his eyes and made a promise he was sure he shouldn't keep.
"Deal," he said.
Jason held him tighter.
He melted against Jason's warmth letting it soothe his tattered soul.
He was disappointed when Jason let him go.
Toshiro didn't understand how it was possible for a man to be so warm, so giving and comforting.
Their conversation lightened, Jason told him stories of growing up in Penn Yan.
His face lighting up as he talked about his mother who now lived with her new husband.
"I thought I'd hate seeing her get married, but watching her with him makes me smile," Jason said.
"They're so in love.
I get jealous that she found someone to be with her as she ages."
Toshiro couldn't help but wonder about his own mother.
Did she think about him?
He'd heard rumors that she was tough and ruthless in business.
Did she love his father?
"What about you, Toshi?"
Jason asked him.
"What were your parents like?
Did you get to meet them before they died?"
Toshiro wiped a hand down his face.
"I--uh--I don't like talking about it."
"It's good to talk about your parents, Toshi," Jason insisted.
"You'll keep their memory alive that way."
"I was too young to remember much," Toshiro said unable to keep out the bitterness.
"I don't have a single memory.
Can we please change this subject?"
"Toshiro," Jason started.
Toshiro grabbed his fishing rod and pulled it out of the water.
"Can we go back now?
I'm getting cold out here."
Toshiro ignored Jason's concerned gaze, trying to push back the anger that swelled each time he thought about his family.
He didn't want to talk or think about his parents.
He wasn't worthy of being a Natake.
That family was full of upstanding members of society, he'd seen the Natakes run projects to help the poor, and abused.
He, on the other hand, had spent most of his life reducing good people to the state of abused, or worse.
How could his father ever look at him and be proud?
How could Jason if he were to find out the truth about him?
"I've said something to upset you," Jason said touching his left arm.
"I'm sorry."
"Don't apologize," Toshiro said.
"I'm-- He broke off and met Jason's concerned gaze.
"I'm not used to sharing.
You have to give me time."
Jason smiled, the sight of it disarming him.
"I don't mind, Toshi.
Since we didn't catch any fish, should we get back to the dock and find out what we'll have for dinner?"
"That sounds good," he agreed as Jason got his fishing rod back into the boat.
"Maybe we should bring fishing nets next time," Jason teased as he started the motor.
Toshiro shuddered.
"No way, who would prepare and cook all that fish?"
"You," Jason said with a grin.
"Hells no," Toshi laughed.
"I'd definitely leave it to you, mister."
*** That evening, Toshiro was in the common bathroom after a shower, his concentration centered on the healing wound on his right arm when Jason knocked on the door.
"Are you decent?"
"Yeah," Toshiro said as he taped a bandage over the healing bullet wound on his arm.
He was looking forward to removing Agent Baron's stitches.
"How did you get that?"
Jason asked in shock behind him.
Toshiro met Jason's gaze through the mirror.
"It's just a scratch."
