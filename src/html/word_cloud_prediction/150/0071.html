This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.

Two hours, four hours - -what difference would it make?
"Agreed.
My staff will bring you back to Val'jn'd'jt in four hours.
I am confident that the matter will be fully resolved at that time."
With the guards standing at the ready, the Zebatians had no choice but to capitulate.
"You will regret this, Ambassador Sarek," Zilgrinshlep threatened just before the heavy front door closed behind them.
Sarek was already regretting a number of things.
What was one more?
At least Sahaj still hadn't returned.
He would just be another complication that would keep him from concentrating on this confusing mystery.
He was about to reenter his office when the front door opened again, this time to allow the original complication, dressed in Starfleet's black and science blue, to back into the hall.
CHAPTER SIX Spock had not expected to be nearly bowled over by a swarm of Zebatian prisoners on a forced march as he had materialized in front of the door to his family's quarters.
He had quickly stepped to the side as the entourage scuttled out the door, then watched them go for a moment, before turning back to enter the family quarters.
Everything in the entrance hall looked normal and unchanged, including Sarek who was standing near his study door, looking back at him, seeming unsurprised to see him.
"Father," he said, both acknowledging Sarek's presence and requesting an explanation with the word.
"I am not certain I fully understand the matter myself, Spock.
I am grateful for your presence, however, for this fish story is of sufficient political import that I may require your assistance."
"Certainly, Father.
I will do whatever....
Fish story, sir?"
"A whopper."
"Whopper," Spock echoed, studying his father with concern.
Perhaps Sahaj had been correct after all.
As he approached the elder, Spock saw the tension lines around his father's eyes, and Sarek was acting with questionable behavior.
"Sir, as I recall, a 'whopper' was the 20th century appellation for a Terran meal consisting of chopped meat and assorted condiments."
"And that is precisely what I am going to turn your son into the moment he makes his appearance."
"I see," Spock replied, stalling for time, time in which he hoped to have a brilliant flash of insight into Sarek's strange illness that had caused him to want to turn his grandson into fast food.
"I do not understand."
Sarek arched a heavy eyebrow.
"Spock, I believe you are listing.
Has one of your legs grown longer than the other?"
Things must be catastrophic if Sarek, of all people, was making jokes.
Or was that a result of his illness?
In tones of gritted teeth Spock said, "Captain Kirk has temporarily diverted the Enterprise so that I may assess and possibly resolve matters here.
I have precisely five hours before I must report back to duty.
Therefore, would you please enlighten me as to the facts?"
They entered Sarek's study-- spacious, airy, and with the colorful biosphere drawing the eye - and took seats opposite one another, with Sarek's desk between them.
There was no small talk.
Sarek immediately began relaying the events prior to Spock's unexpected arrival.
By the time Sarek finished, Spock was somewhat sorry he had asked.
While the situation Sarek had described deserved attention, it was not exactly why Spock had come home.
"Cyrano Jones?"
Spock repeated incredulously.
"You made a purchase from Cyrano Jones?"
He shook his head in wonder, then he lifted one shoulder in a minute shrug.
"I suppose we should consider ourselves fortunate that he did not take Sahaj on as an apprentice.
With the two of them working in tandem, there would be no hope for the galaxy."
"I suggest we find your son and question him, as I believe he holds the key to the solution to this mystery."
Spock instinctively started to open the mindlink he still had with his son, but hesitated to use it for fear of drawing Sahaj further into trouble.
"I assume you have not restored his right to carry a comm?"
"Correct, and he has not chosen to replace the five he has taken apart, lost essential parts of, or otherwise broken.
Regardless, I would prefer to keep this search within the family for now, and on-the-ground rather than on comm channels to prevent it from becoming an intergalactic conflict."
"When is he due to return from his camping trip?"
"He was due two hours ago.
He may have stopped to have breakfast with the Gills.
I suggest you begin the search for Sahaj there while I contact T'Pau for instructions on the Zebatian issue.
I will ask your mother to stay at home and detain the child should he return before we do.
Let us rendezvous here in three point seven five hours at the latest."
"Agreed."
Without further discussion, they set out on their respective missions.
CHAPTER SEVEN While serving as Earth's Ambassador to Ventura, Jeremy Gill had removed Sahaj from his mother's neglect and raised him as one of his own.
That fact alone would have been reason enough for Spock to welcome him to Vulcan.
But the tall human with the salt-and-pepper hair and kindly demeanor had put Sahaj's need for the chi'am'jt, the parental bond, before his own desire to keep his 'family' intact.
When T'Marr had died, he had sent Sahaj to Vulcan, which had probably saved the boy's life.
A year after that, the Enterprise had been assigned to transport Ambassador Gill to his new post on Vulcan.
During that trip, Spock and Gill had formed a tentative friendship that had continued to grow with time.
Neither cared to exclude the other from Sahaj's life, and so the Gills had become extended family, with Jason and Sahaj equally at home at Val'jn'd'jt or in the terran-style house in Embassy Circle.
Gill seemed first surprised, then delighted, when he first opened the door in response to Spock's knock and then he invited him in. Spock quickly explained the situation.
He learned that Jason had arrived home from the camping trip on schedule some two hours before.
Tired, sunburned, and hungry, the boy had eaten breakfast and gone straight to bed.
But at Spock's request they woke him.
Groggy and irritable, the tow-headed child blinked and mumbled his way through his answer to Spock's question.
"Left him and Selak at the edge of town.
He was going to walk Selak home."
Jason punched his pillow into shape and buried his head in it.
Before the adults could question him further, he raised his head again and shook his blond hair out of his eyes."Oh yeah.
He said he was going to go look for a mate for Sarek."
He dropped his head back to his pillow.
His eyelids drooped.
The two adults exchanged an incredulous glance.
"Jason," Spock said in his most reasonable voice, "do you know why Sahaj thought Sarek needed a mate?"
"Something about...a pond that was far... something like that.
Said Sarek would die if he didn't have a mate.
Can I go back to sleep now?
I'm really, really tired."
Spock nodded absently, his thoughts already on the next step of his search.
Gill walked with him to the door.
"Do you want me to go with you?"
"Unnecessary at this time.
However I reserve the right to call on you and Jason to help with the search if Sahaj is not with Selak."
"Don't worry, Spock.
You know Sahaj.
He'll show up, safe and sound, with a perfectly lame-brained explanation for all of this."
Spock managed to look affronted.
"Worry is a human emotion, Ambassador.
I am merely seeking information to diffuse a political conflict."
"Of course," the Ambassador said in his best diplomatic tones.
Then, after he closed the door behind Spock he added, "And sehlats fly."
CHAPTER EIGHT Although they had chosen different career paths, Spock and his boyhood friend, Sepek, had managed to keep in touch, albeit sporadically.
It had come as no surprise when Sepek had proposed a bonding between his daughter, T'ian, and Sahaj.
A private meeting had taken place with Sepek, his wife, T'Arianina, and Spock.
Of the three, only T'Arianina had expressed any doubt about the match.
Sahaj had only recently committed to the Vulcan lifestyle.
Further, T'Arianina wanted her daughter to have a say in the choosing of her mate, something Spock also wanted for his son.
All three of them were concerned about the growing tendency for women to divorce their mates immediately after their time, or even before, as had happened to Spock.
Both men postulated that Sahaj and T'ian suited as mates because of their continuing friendship.
The men had prevailed, but as a compromise, they agreed to wait until Sahaj had passed his kahs-wan before the formal bonding ceremony took place.
Sahaj had passed his kahs-wan on the first try.
Both he and T'ian had repeatedly expressed willingness for the bonding to take place but it had been difficult to coordinate Spock's schedule with T'Arianina's.
Since both were needed to control the forming of the psionic bond the event had yet to take place.
When Spock arrived at Sepek's modest home on the west side of the city he found Selak and his year-younger sister, T'ian, both of whom had inherited their mother's dark hair and eyes, engaged in weaponry practice in the exercise area on the side of their home.
As Spock approached, he saw Selak deliberately lower his defensive stance to allow T'ian to use the lirpa she held to drive him a few steps back.
The first to see Spock was H'erja, a massive sehlat.
She rose from her place near the children and lumbered over to greet him with a sniffing inspection.
Spock scratched her sable-colored head absently.
But even her welcome did not distract the combatants.
"You deliberately did not defend yourself, Older Brother.
By doing so you prevented me from testing my skills under realistic circumstances."
"I was equalizing the match, giving you a handicap.
However, if you insist...."
Selak reversed his lirpa in two expert moves and, using the blunt side, jabbed his sister in the midsection with just enough force to knock the breath out of her and push her off her feet.
She landed in a sitting position that allowed her to see their visitor.
The weaponry match was forgotten, the lirpas placed in safe position on the ground, and both children stood respectfully to raise the salute.
Spock returned the greeting, letting his gaze linger fondly on T'ian for an extra moment.
A year younger than Sahaj she might be, but for all her youth she was extremely self aware, perhaps because of the frequent off-world trips made by her family.
Her calmness and rationality would be a good influence on Sahaj.
In fact, had she already been bonded to Sahaj this absurd situation might never have even developed.
"My son has not yet returned to Val'jn'd'jt.
Do either of you know where he is?"
"He left me at our gate over two hours ago," Selak answered.
"He stated he had to find a mate for Sarek before returning home."
"Did he say how he would accomplish such a task?"
"He said he'd stop people on the street if he had to, but that he would first check out the shops."
Surely, Sahaj knew better than to embarrass his family by making public a thing that was best left to silence.
"Did he say which shops he would investigate?"
"The logical place to try, Honored Sir, would be a pet emporium."
Spock stared at T'ian, disbelieving.
So much for rationality.
"It is of the utmost importance that Sahaj be located within the next three hours."
Both siblings immediately volunteered to help.
Several calls later Spock had also enlisted the help of the Gills, contacted Sarek, and instructed the Peace Forcers to locate and restrain the child covertly.
His last call was to Jim Kirk on the Enterprise.
"We have his medical records from when we brought him over from Ventura," Kirk said when Spock had filled him in.
"We can use the ship's scanners to check the desert and I'll send out a team to help check ShiKahr, unobtrusively, of course.
We don't want to stir the political pot any more than we have to."
Spock continued on with the search, on the constant lookout as he visited shops on his way through the city.
Jim Kirk beamed down and offered his company as moral support, a gesture that Spock appreciated.
Unfortunately, Sahaj was nowhere to be found.
As the hours passed, Spock had to forcibly restrain his imagination, putting from him thoughts of aircar accidents, abductions by alien sex perverts, and amnesia.
With only fifteen minutes until the rendezvous time, he admitted defeat and he and Jim Kirk returned to Val'jn'd'jt. CHAPTER NINE Spock, with his captain at his side, found his parents, Jeremy Gill, and Doctor McCoy in Sarek's study.
