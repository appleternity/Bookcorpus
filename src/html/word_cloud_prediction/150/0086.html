Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The comfort of their entwined hands tugged at the pit of her belly.
Soon enough they pulled up to his building and she stood mindlessly on the sidewalk while he paid, not even thinking to offer.
Then he had her hand again and was leading her through his lobby to the elevators.
They stood side by side staring forward.
Any control she had over her emotions collapsed when her tear streaked reflection stared back at her from the closed mirrored elevator doors.
Her face curled in agony, the sob immediate.
He wrapped her in his arms, one hand cradling her head while she cried into his shoulder.
"Shhh, we'll find her," he assured her.
Then soft lips placed a gentle kiss on her temple and that peace engulfed her again.
His arms stayed around her shoulder when they got off and like a miracle Lucy Lynn was sitting, leaning against his door, asleep.
"Lucy Lynn," Marcie Mae shrieked and rushed the door.
She had the girl in a bear hold within seconds.
"Lemme go, Marcie Mae.
I can' breath."
The girl complained yawning.
"Oh my god, you little drama queen.
Don' you even do some'n like this again!"
But she hadn't relaxed the hold on her girl.
"You don' even know what kinda worry you put me through."
"I'm sorry.
I know."
Lucy Lynn's answer was muffled in the strangle hold Marcie Mae had on her.
"Let's go in," Will touched Marcie Mae's shoulder gently and she nodded struggling to stand up with Lucy Lynn in her arms.
He laughed, "here.
She's a little big for you."
He swept her up in his arms and walked them through to his apartment.
Chapter 5
She was so light in his arms, fragile.
An overpowering sense of claim engulfed him, like something within him, naturally, instinctually knew she was his to protect.
The memory had flashed as soon as Marcie Mae had mentioned hair: "Jesus Christ, Laura that hurt.
What are you doing?"
She had only laughed and coyly waved the few strands of dark hair that she had plucked.
It was one of the last times he had seen her.
No matter what his logical and selfish brain might try to convince him otherwise, Lucy was his.
He didn't need a doctor to prove it.
"Little girl," he warned with a warmth and bit of mirth that belied his serious tone.
"If you do one more crazy thing today, or anytime in the near future, I'm going to take you over my knee."
To his surprise she looked fearful.
Until then, he hadn't thought she was afraid of anything.
"Yes sir."
He considered her from his vantage with a resigned smile.
She looked so small sitting a little dejected on his couch.
Then he glanced over at her stunning aunt looking unsure and a little uneasy.
"Can I get you something?"
Marcie Mae shook her head.
"No.
I'm a little dazed.
Everythin' catchin' up to me."
Then her stomach rumbled and she blushed, a full body blush, and he wouldn't have minded seeing the rest of that beautiful body flushed.
"You're hungry?"
He asked gently.
He wanted to repave the jagged road their relationship had started on.
She blushed and shook her head.
Something told him she was the gentlest creature on earth and the proudest.
She'd rather eat her pride than ask for food.
"Come on."
He smiled down at Lucy Lynn.
"Let's see what Melida has in the kitchen."
He led them through the long butler's pantry to the kitchen.
The home was set up for someone who didn't cook, would never need to cook, and so didn't need to see the cooking while he relaxed.
A small Latin lady was busy cleaning up pans when they walked through.
"Oh, you home?"
She looked stunned to see him.
Sometimes they went months without seeing each other.
She was clearly interested in the woman and little girl following him.
"Melida, I have some guests tonight.
They're hungry."
Her eyes lit up.
"I get to feed tonight?"
They'd been together forever.
She had been his childhood nanny.
In many ways, she was his family as much as his real family.
She leaned down to Lucy Lynn and asked, "you wan' spaghetti?"
Lucy Lynn nodded vigorously.
"Den you have it."
She turned back to the fridge, pulled out some cheese and fruit and before they could blink she was pushing a cheese tray in their hands and shooing them.
"Now go.
Gi' me little time.
Some warning, William," she admonished Will as she waved her towel at them.
Full from heaps of spaghetti and meatballs, they were lounged on the huge couch that was situated to face his huge wrap around balcony.
The tree tops of Central Park were peaking up over the railing.
He'd just wowed them by unveiling his ninety inch flatscreen from its hiding place behind a large, privately commissioned David Cobley on the wall between the four sets of massive balcony doors.
They were still laughing about that when he looked up from his phone and spoke.
"Looks like the next flight isn't until tomorrow."
He felt a little guilty in his white lie.
There was a midnight flight.
That was too late to send them home and he wasn't going to do it.
Really, he didn't want to send them home.
"Oh," Marcie Mae's face fell.
"Then I guess we need to find somewhere to stay."
She looked lost and he smothered his smile.
"You'll stay here."
He assured her.
"No that isn' necessary.
Jus' somewhere safe, maybe close to the airport."
"You'll stay here," he said in his practiced tone of authority.
She instantly cowed.
He contemplated her skittish gestures thinking how like a gentle siren she was.
Lucy Lynn was grinning ear to ear next to her and he couldn't smother his smile.
She was never going to be mistaken for a gentle siren.
She was a bull in a china shop, a very expensive china shop.
"I don' know," Marcie Mae tried again.
"I'm not sending my daughter to some motel.
So if you don't want to stay, fine.
But she's staying."
He knew this was low and that she would never leave Lucy Lynn behind.
Lucy Lynn squealed out and threw herself into his arms.
Rather naturally, his arms wrapped around to hold her tightly.
Marcie Mae looked crescent fallen.
"Alright then.
We'll stay, 'till mornin'."
He set Lucy Lynn next to him and draped an arm over her shoulder as he handed her the remote.
Then he put his feet up on his cost of a mid-size car, larger than life coffee table and smiled broadly.
"It's pretty fun here," he reasoned.
"It sure is," Lucy Lynn agreed wholeheartedly while searching for Nickelodeon.
Within an hour she was asleep against him.
Her little body was warm rising and falling with her soft rhythmic breathing.
Something comfortable washed over him, like a habit forming that would not be easy to break.
Her aunt was sitting at the far end of the couch looking like a scared cat pretending to watch some silly teeny bopper show.
"She's sleeping," he said in a hush and Marcie Mae looked over and smiled gently at her sleeping niece.
He shifted himself forward and scooped Lucy Lynn up easily.
She didn't even twitch.
"I'll show you where you can sleep."
He led her to a long hall and said quietly, "any of these rooms."
"We jus' need the one.
We'll sleep togetha'."
"Ok," he opened the door to the biggest room.
"How about this one?"
She stood transfixed at the doorway a stunned look on her face.
He couldn't know she'd never seen anything so beautiful or grand.
Then she rubbed her head again.
"I have such a headache."
He put Lucy down and took a moment to study her sleeping face.
Then he said, "I'll get something for your head."
Marcie Mae nodded and suddenly the dark circles under her eyes looked even darker.
The exhaustion of the day made her look young and beaten.
There was an urge, in his arms, which made him want to fold her in again like he had in the elevator.
It had been so easy and effortless.
He fought it biding his time knowing this wasn't the right moment to try.
He gave her a soft smile and squeeze of her hand before heading out on his errand.
By the time he came back to the room, Lucy Lynn was snuggled under the comforter with a serene smile on her face.
A dim reading lamp on an arm table across the room was glowing for comfort.
Otherwise, the room was empty.
He sat down with the glass of water and two pills he held.
She was such a little thing, fragile, for all her bravado.
And in sleep she seemed so innocent, pure.
What was he going to do with her?
He shook his head as different scenarios ran through it.
He was not a family man, or so he thought.
Still, he had a child.
