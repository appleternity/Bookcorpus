That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talking about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .'

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

I was beginning to wonder just how powerful this fae lord really was.
Considering the wounds we'd received from his house, it seemed safe to presume he was hella dangerous.
"First," Periphetes said, holding up a hand.
"Do you have the dagger?"
"No.
What's so important about this dagger?
It was hardly the prize of that collection," challenged Nik.
"Not good," Periphetes sighed, his thin shoulders slumping forward.
After a second's hesitation, he went on.
"Veneno was used in a ritual to entrap Sedgrave, the last sorcerer who had the power to create daywalkers.
If someone figured out how to free him, they would require the blade."
Nik slouched forward, covering his face in his hands and resting his elbows on his knees.
His hands shook as they slid up his face to tangle in his hair.
I watched him, wondering why his reaction was so strong.
Oh well, I thought.
It serves him right.
After all, he was the one stupid enough to steal that dagger for Emma in the first place, and from a seriously powerful fae too!
"So... what's the big deal?"
Samuel asked.
The other three glared at him.
He shrugged and continued, "I mean I would like to go out during the day.
What's the big deal if someone succeeds in raising this... this Sedgrave?"
I raised my hand.
"Is that why they want me?"
I asked before clamping my hand over my mouth.
I had a feeling my involvement in the situation was still intended as a secret.
"We don't know that for sure," offered Nik.
It sounded like a lie.
"Ah, so she is important," Periphetes said, his ice-blue eyes twinkling.
Knowing I'd just blown my cover--good job, Ashley--we spent the next twenty minutes telling the story of my first week as a vampire.
By the time we finished, I was struggling to stay awake; after all, it wasn't very exciting to those who had already lived it.
Nik had to shake me.
I blinked the sleepiness away, trying to force my eyes to focus.
The fae looked as though he was thinking deeply.
Mikhail eyed me a moment before calling out someone's name.
A hidden door in the far corner opened and a human stepped through, his shirt sleeves conveniently rolled up.
When he reached us, Mikhail waved him in my direction.
He held out his wrist, which showed signs of previous gnawing.
I clamped my lips shut and held my breath.
I could hear the man's heartbeat.
It called to me, a soft but persistent sound in my ears.
I shook my head and whispered, "I don't have good control.
I'd kill him."
"Niiiiik," growled Mikhail, but he didn't argue and the man went away.
Once he was gone, I could think again.
Periphetes was watching me with humor in his eyes.
I felt like a sideshow freak when I realized he wasn't the only one watching me.
"So, young lady, you are Ailmer Hawnly's descendent?
Yes, even after all these generations, I can see him in you.
No wonder Richard and the queens have been after you with such a vengeance."
"Hey, this means it wasn't my cat's issues rubbing off on me," I stated as the thought came to me.
It resulted in another ten minutes of explanation.
Periphetes and Mikhail were rather confused by my talking cat.
Periphetes smiled as he recalled Tereus, the fae my cat had once been.
Evidently, they had known each other long before any of us had been alive, even Mikhail.
"Quite the rascal," commented Periphetes.
"Still, Tereus is not our issue.
Sedgrave and Hawnly's descendant are," he added, pointing at me.
"Who is Ailmer Hawnly?"
I asked.
"He was a wizard, the child of a fae and a human, and thus he was very powerful even before he became a wizard.
Ailmer contrived a way to destroy Sedgrave--the sorcerer who could make daywalkers--since mere death would not touch the sorcerer.
Obviously, the vampires were fans of Sedgrave and his work.
When the vampires found out about Ailmer's plans, they turned him, thinking it would take his powers and be a more fitting punishment than death.
And to an extent, it worked.
Sort of poetic, don't you think?
"But Ailmer was a man of honor.
He knew what needed to be done.
He turned the spell into a ritual.
Ritualistic magic, which can be done by just about anyone even if they don't have the innate talent for magic, is very powerful when done correctly.
When done incorrectly it results in mayhem and destruction.
Ailmer, having been a wizard for decades, was very good at focusing, planning, preparing--all the things needed to succeed in ritualistic magic.
In the end, the ritual required him to sacrifice himself.
He died to trap Sedgrave."
"Wait, let me get this straight," I began.
"Ailmer, my ancestor, the product of a fae and a human, was turned into a vampire to take away his fae and wizard powers.
So he did a ritual, sacrificing his vampire self, and therefore trapped the bad guy who could make daywalkers... and that's why they turned me?"
"They turned you because it needs to be a vampire sacrifice to free Sedgrave.
Just as it was a vampire sacrifice that trapped him."
"So I would die... " my voice trailed off.
"That is the story."
"Is there any way to wake Sedgrave without killing Ashley?"
Samuel asked, as though he didn't really care whether I died or not.
Everyone looked at him with varying levels of disgust.
I can only guess what my face looked like.
"Other than the whole Ashley-would-be-dead thing, no one has told me why Sedgrave coming back would be so bad.
Or why Ailmer thought it so important to destroy him."
Periphetes sighed, his breath coming out in frozen wisps.
"Sedgrave could do a lot more than make daywalkers.
That was just a side trick.
He had the ability to make anyone love him to the point of being willing to die for him."
Maybe I was just tired, but I couldn't figure out why that was so bad.
It didn't seem so far away from what vampires did to their humans, or what a primus did to his seethe.
I blinked, trying to stay awake.
Josh asked my question for me, speaking for the first time.
"That doesn't sound too horrid."
"Do you really think Charles the Fifth became so powerful on his own?"
Periphetes asked.
I was confused; the better-educated men understood.
I couldn't remember who Charles the Fifth was or what he had done.
I knew he was the guy who had once possessed all the stuff we stole for Emma, but that was about it.
My brain was just barely functioning enough to even make that connection.
"He didn't become emperor over so many countries purely by accident or hereditary rights.
Sedgrave was at his side throughout most of his life.
The love and devotion inspired by Sedgrave caused people to kill for him.
Those who should have inherited died at young ages before they could produce an heir of their own, creating room for Charles.
I could spend the next couple days telling you how Sedgrave impacted the power structure of the sixteenth century.
Imagine that sort of power in this time.
Presidents and such at his disposal.
Public opinion in his favor.
Imagine him appearing on TV and the whole world being affected by his charisma.
It would destroy society as we know it."
I glanced up at Josh.
"Wow, looks like we really screwed the pooch," he said in a humorless voice.
Periphetes nodded.
"So who has the dagger?"
"Emma Tanner.
She's the primus of the Gresham Seethe, near Portland."
Everyone's faces contorted into frowns, trying to make the connection between Emma and the present trouble in Olympia.
Finally, I spoke up.
"Could Emma be working with Richard or one of the queens?"
"No.
If she were, I would know about it," murmured Nik.
"I realize I don't know her like you do," I paused, letting the insinuation set in.
"But she seems the type to consider the end, not the means.
If she wants to be a daywalker, I doubt anything would stop her, even hooking up with a prick like Richard."
Nik didn't respond.
Chapter Thirty-Nine I woke the next night, my mind a complete blank.
I'd slipped into unconsciousness so slowly that I couldn't exactly pinpoint my last waking memory.
Enjoying the luxury of Nik's bed, I blinked a few times before sitting up and looking around me.
In a swift motion, I jerked the blankets back up to my chin, though I was perfectly decent in a long, black T-shirt and pajama pants.
But it's hard to feel decent when a fae is watching you sleep.
Periphetes smiled, his visible breath cooling the room.
He shifted his stance, slowly crossing his arms over his narrow chest.
His frosty eyes slid over me and assessed the room.
"So, you stay in his room."
He glanced at the couch, covered in Nik's blanket and pillow.
"But don't share his bed.
Has anyone ever told you, you are a strange girl?"
"All the time.
Has anyone ever told you it's not polite to sneak in and watch someone sleep?"
The fae smiled.
"You do not have a room of your own."
It was a statement, and yet a question at the same time.
"No, I'm pretty new to the seethe.
Actually, I don't think I'm technically part of the seethe yet."
"You know, you don't have to join the seethe or any seethe for that matter."
"Really?"
I asked, my interest piqued.
Thus far, seethe life had not been exactly roses and pearls.
