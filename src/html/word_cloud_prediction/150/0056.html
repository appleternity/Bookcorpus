The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation.

With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'

The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

To escape such a fate and save the life within her, she would have to find some means of fleeing their escort back to the manse.
Biting her nails nervously, she tried to steady her breathing.
There is no need to worry yet, she chided herself.
First, she had to confirm the suspicion.
Then, she needed to feed.
**** He had not come.
Amarinda considered the contrast of her pale hands against the dark fur she had ensconced herself in to ward off the cold.
The threat of tears burned her eyes.
She allowed the fat droplets to trickle down her face and splash into her lap.
Even if she tried to blink them away, they fell all the same.
Tonight she would be ransomed.
Tonight she would be brought with the lives of the Hunters who were sworn to protect her - she would be returned by her mate who she was now bound to until her last breath.
As the daylight faded, the ache in her heart only grew and so did her fear.
Still, she was uncertain about the validity of Rhys' claim.
But if he was wrong, why did Graeme abandon her?
She had hoped to share her last moments at the stronghold with him.
She wanted to savor a last kiss, a last touch.
Instead, she was left cold, alone and afraid.
At dusk, she caught his scent down the hall.
Heart thundering, she positioned herself close to the window and presented a very cold exterior.
His footsteps were soft when he approached the locked door.
He paused there.
She waited, wanting him to venture, half afraid that he would not.
The echo of metal grating preceded a flutter within her stomach.
A quiver shot through her.
On gently protesting hinges, the door was pushed in.
Even with her back facing him, she knew he looked at her.
"Tonight is the new moon," she offered to fill the silence that was beginning to stretch between them.
He advanced in slow, calculated steps.
"So it is."
She could not bring herself to look at him.
The pain within her breast proved near overwhelming.
"There is something I must ask you."
When he said nothing, she took that as a sign that he was listening and continued.
"Is it true that I carry no scent?"
For a painstaking moment he was silent.
When he spoke, his voice sounded strained.
"Yes."
Amarinda hiccupped and sucked in an agonizing gasp.
She darted to her feet and faced him squarely, eyes swamped with unshed tears.
His hair was wet and he smelled of fresh water and herbs, and his eyes, dark in the shadows, were focused upon her.
She cleared her throat and worked her jaw in an attempt to speak.
"Do - do you hear it?"
Another pause.
She noted the way he cocked his head and focused.
With baited breath, she waited.
He stepped forward almost hesitantly and tried again before shaking his head.
"Then - then maybe you are mistaken.
Maybe -" "You are with child Amarinda," he sliced in softly.
Trembling, she found her way to the bed and sank her weight into the furs.
Hearing him speak the words chased rational thought out of her mind.
In that split second she had forgotten about her plan to escape the Coven.
It was the sudden shift of the bed that forced her to look up and acknowledge his presence.
He did not touch her.
They sat unspeaking for a long time.
Amarinda interlocked her fingers and chewed on her lower lip, the mechanisms in her brain working incessantly.
It was winter, and she did not know these lands.
As far as she could see, the stronghold was well hidden in the depths of the mountains.
The Hunters had been trained to track since they could walk.
They would find her effortlessly, and upon her capture, the Elder would no doubt include a more brutal form of punishment for her attempt to flee.
Not only would there be the Hunters, but Weres as well.
Because she had lost her scent, they might not harm her, but would be suspicious all the same.
She would have to trade in her clothes for a used, human garb in order to side-track their enquiry.
Her only other option would be to ask him for help.
She hesitated and dashed tears from her eyes promptly.
She would find no aid here.
He had not marked her, and he was set on seeing her ransomed.
She would have to take her chances with the Hunters.
"I will return before midnight.
Be ready and waiting."
His tone was clipped and had lost all tenderness.
Stung, she pushed away the hurt and darted to her feet before he made it to the door.
"It is cold and I am hungry.
I would like a boon of warm clothing and..."
He looked at her, and for a split second he appeared almost anguished.
Still, he turned to her and unclipped the thick fur from around his neck.
It was adjusted about her shoulders slowly.
Amarinda stood unmoving, relishing each brush his hands made against her body.
When he slipped off the shirt and offered his neck, she closed her eyes and leaned into his whipcord frame.
Her teeth breeched the wall of his skin and she heard him hiss at the agony there.
The pleasure would come.
It always made him loose control.
She waited for it, needing him now more than ever.
He trembled, and when his fingers sank into her arms painfully, it was to push her away.
There was finality in the way he released her.
Amarinda pressed her pale fingers to the blood, stained on her lips and whimpered, the need deep in her belly becoming an urgent ache.
His nostrils flared at the evidence of her desire.
He stepped away, shirt in hand, and turned his back without as much as a backward glance.
She stumbled upon the bed feebly.
The door was closed and bolted.
Her hand went to her stomach protectively.
This was his offspring.
This was the reason she had to pull herself together and fight.
Still, no matter how she tried to shake the hurt, it refused to cease.
Chapter Eight "What is taking them so long?"
Macer shifted on his mount, impatience heavy in his voice.
Beside him, Vilirus did not offer a reply.
His dark gaze was focused on the stronghold that was heavily guarded and well lit.
From their position hidden just within the tree line, he noted the Weres that lined the outer wall.
"We should have brought more Hunters," Macer continued softly.
His horse pranced nervously beneath his agitated form.
"Sutter said he would deliver on the eve of the new moon.
He is late.
If everything does not go according to plan -" "He will not renege on his word," Vilirus offered nonchalantly.
For a quarter of an hour they waited in silence.
When the tell-tale rumbled of hoof beats was heard on the gentle wind, both men turned their mounts around and ventured deeper into the trees and away from the clearing.
Moments later, Silas appeared.
Behind each of the three horses was attached a lead rope, and on the ground, leaving a blood-stained trail in the cold dirt through two very large sacks, was the smell of dead flesh.
"What was that charlatans excuse for delivering so late?"
demanded Macer.
Silas' expression was guarded when he replied.
"The Lost proved less than - cooperative."
Vilirus took control of his nervous horse with an expert hand.
"We are being followed.
They have been on our tails from the moment we came onto their territory."
"Let us get this over with then.
The moon is almost to the center of the sky.
It is time."
Before anyone could advance, something large and swift disturbed the trees in the darkness.
The Hunters' swords were in hand in a flash.
Except for the hum of steel, they made no other sound.
A decisive growl warned of an approach.
Almost completely invisible to the human eye, beneath the thick canopy of leafless branches, they caught the Weres scent long before they clearly recognized his silhouette.
He stood a few feet away, breathing evenly, body held tight as if ready to bolt at any moment.
He did not pose a threat - yet.
Of average height, Macer noted that he was built like an ox - wide in the shoulder and slim at the waist - and was covered in a thin layer of hair.
His hands lingered at his sides.
Clawed fingers twitched ever so slightly.
"Where is your master?"
he whipped in ire.
The Were looked up at him through lowered lids.
"My leader commands that you follow me."
Macer nudged his mount forward and paused before looking down his nose.
"We have brought the payment - a hundred heads as demanded.
Tell that mongrel son of a bitch to bring my daughter here to me."
"Your insults may very well cost you your life, bloodsucker.
If you do not follow me, he will see her killed.
Then either way, it is your loss."
He slinked back into the cover of the trees.
Macer snarled and kicked his mount into a galloping run.
The others followed.
On silent feet the Were ran, and were it not for his scent that left a trail in his wake, the Hunters would have had a difficult time keeping pace.
Well away from the clearing they rode until they came to a steep hill.
Mounts were reigned in violently.
Vilirus sniffed the air and frowned.
Silas' feet touched the hard earth before any other.
"They are near the water," he informed, adjusting the sword on his back.
Vilirus chewed on his jaw brutally.
"It could be an ambush."
"He would not risk it - not this far from the stronghold."
