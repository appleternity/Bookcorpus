E.g., in the Temperature or Location_of_light frames:  'I can never bake anything in my oven because it 's too hot.' 'She gave him a really bright flashlight for Christmas.'"}, {'frame': 'Being_obligated', 'tfidf': 0.8105206011073764, 'lexical_unit': 'obligated.a / duty.n / job.n / task.n / responsibility.n / obligation.n / bound.a / assignment.n / mission.n / commission.n / contract.n / obliged.a / imposition.n', 'definition': "Under some Condition, usually left implicit, a Responsible_party is required to perform some Duty.  If they do not perform the Duty, there may be some undesirable Consequence, which may or may not be stated overtly.  'It is my duty to fight any attack on the Brotherhood .' 'This country has the responsibility to support its citizens' right to express themselves.' 'I am obligated to pay or they'll double the fine.'  NB:  Contrast this frame with Likelihood and Preconditions frames, which involve many of the same lemmas.  Many LUs which might be expected to be found here (should, must, have to) are actually in the Required_event frame. Our analysis is that these LUs do not evoke an obligation directly, although they are frequently used in contexts that are consistent with an understanding of obligation and are pragmatically strengthened to (defeasibly) imply an obligation.

The healthy Chinese did not wait around for their sick countrymen.
When their guides were ready to leave, those not well enough to travel were left behind.
Amanda Medcroft was expecting another baby; however due to her pregnancy she was not permitted to offer her services as a volunteer.
She did not see much of Harry as he worked day and night, and all week long.
Amanda and Elizabeth Blakely had become firm friends; even though there was a marked difference in age and rank.
Towards the end of February, Elizabeth Blakely became ill.
Dr Maclagan was worried.
She had contracted some form of Eastern Dysentery from contact with the sick Chinese.
He commenced a course of treatment, however Elizabeth in her weakened state was not responding to the treatment Amanda Medcroft was saddened by this news.
She wanted to visit Elizabeth; but was not allowed anywhere near her friend.
She sat in her bedroom and reflected on their friendship.
Her mind drifted back to how they first met in January 1855.
"Amanda, I am home."
Harry called out as he stepped into his Customs' office adjacent to their lodgings.
"Would you like a cup of tea, Harry?"
"Yes, that will be good.
Have you had a good day?"
"Yes Harry, while you are having a cup of tea I will get the children ready for our dinner appointment with Captain Blakely and his family."
By 5:30 pm Harry and his family were ready for the walk up to Robe House.
Harry locked their front door and picked up Jason.
Amanda had baby Tristan tucked into his baby carriage.
They set off for Robe House.
Robe House had been constructed from local limestone blocks.
It was an imposing residence.
They were greeted at the door by a valet.
"Good evening Mr Medcroft.
Captain Blakely is expecting you.
Please follow me to the main drawing room."
Robe House was furnished in the typical fashion of houses in Queen Victoria's reign.
It was good quality furniture, but not ostentatious.
Phillip Blakely, his wife Elizabeth and their six children were waiting for them.
Amanda could sense from the atmosphere in the room that they were a close knit, loving family.
Captain Blakely seemed to be a likeable, fair sort of a person.
Mrs Blakely appeared to be a lively, compassionate, caring individual.
Their six children ranged from a toddler to teenagers.
Phillip Blakely spoke, "Mr and Mrs Medcroft, this is my wife Elizabeth and our children; Alicia, Amanda, Samuel, Jason, Sarah and Edward."
Harry spoke, "It is an honour to meet you Mrs Blakely.
This is my wife Amanda and our children Jason and Tristan."
He turned to Captain Blakely, "We want to thank you Sir, for your invitation to dine with you all."
"It is our pleasure Harry; now that the formalities are over we can get better acquainted."
Elizabeth Blakely made a bee line to baby Tristan.
"May I call you Amanda, you can call me Elizabeth."
"Yes, of course you can call me Amanda and I would be happy to call you Elizabeth."
The two oldest girls Alicia and Amanda also came over to fuss over baby Tristan.
Phillip Blakely and Harry conversed about the Customs' portfolio and Harry's other responsibilities as Harbourmaster and Receiver of Wrecks.
The valet entered discreetly to inform Captain Blakely the dinner was ready to be served.
"Well everyone dinner is ready.
Let us adjourn to the dining room."
The dining room was quite large with a long rectangular table able to accommodate twenty people.
Captain Blakely sat at the head with his wife and his four youngest children on his right.
Harry and his family sat on his left with the older children.
When dinner was over they all went outside to a side garden.
It was the time of year for long summer twilights.
The cool night air was invigorating.
The younger children played on the lawns.
Everyone else sat and enjoyed the coolness; happily conversing with each other.
As the twilight deepened Harry and Amanda excused themselves wanting to get home before dark.
They took their leave and went home; Jason and Tristan were both asleep.
The Medcrofts were glad to get home and go to bed.
It had been a long day.
From then on, Elizabeth Blakely often had Amanda and her children visit for morning tea; before the heat of the day set in.
While it was good to reflect on pleasant times; Amanda's thoughts returned to the present.
She found it hard to erase the reality of the dreadful illness that Elizabeth was suffering from.
She wished she could go and comfort her friend; it was distressing Amanda, she felt so helpless.
Dr Maclagan's concern deepened as the days went on.
Elizabeth's condition deteriorated.
Day by day she grew steadily worse.
Captain Blakely found it difficult to leave his official duties to be by his wife's side.
The incoming Chinese placed a heavy strain on the administration of Guichen Bay.
Captain Blakely's resources and the men under his command were really not sufficient for the ongoing situation.
He was thankful for the calibre of his people.
They worked day and night to keep things on an even keel.
Philip Blakely watched his wife's condition deteriorate each day.
Elizabeth was usually so full of life; now she lay listlessly in bed.
Unable to eat because of constant nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea she was losing weight dramatically.
Ongoing fever and accompanying sweats also made her life miserable.
She found it difficult to drink fluids; this exacerbated her already weakened condition.
Her children found the situation very distressing.
They felt helpless.
Their mother was so sick and she was not responding to treatment.
It was a worrying time for them all.
The townspeople rallied around the Blakely family to offer comfort and support.
As the month of March came along; it seemed inevitable that Elizabeth was dying.
She passed away on Sunday 8-March-1857.
Phillip Blakely sat by his wife's side.
Her breathing slowed down.
She slipped into a comatose state.
Long pauses between breaths became normal.
The hours dragged on interminably.
It was stressful waiting for his beloved wife to die.
A dry rattle in her throat as she drew each breath signalled the end was near.
He had seen men die on the battlefield, but this was extremely hard to bear.
He felt completely helpless and hopeless.
Elizabeth made a long sigh and her spirit departed.
Her body went limp and still.
She was gone.
The reality of her passing struck him forcibly.
Phillip Blakely was devastated by the loss of his soul mate.
He brought his children in for a last look at their mother.
They were numb with grief.
Tears poured down their faces.
It did not seem possible that their beloved mother was dead.
It was not fair!
Why did it have to be their mother?
A great outpouring of grief went through the town.
Even the Chinese were saddened by her death.
On the day of her funeral most of Robe Town was at her funeral ceremony.
All the businesses in town closed shop as a mark of respect to Elizabeth Blakely.
As the funeral cortege left Robe House a sad and solemn procession followed it to the cemetery, for the funeral service.
How poignant it was!
Elizabeth Blakely was the second person to be buried in the main part of the Robe Town cemetery.
Phillip Blakely found it hard to concentrate on day to day matters.
He was almost overwhelmed by grief.
However, his military training stood him in good stead.
The people of Guichen Bay District needed him to be a capable leader; with all these China ships arriving at Port Robe.
Animosity towards the Chinese increased.
The townspeople blamed them for Elizabeth Blakely's death.
If she had not had to nurse sick Chinese, she would be alive and well.
Dr Maclagan made the other volunteer ladies very aware that they needed to be careful about their personal hygiene.
In particular, they needed to wash their hands in clean water after contact with the sick.

The Adelaide Times reported on 4-March-1857, that "...during the last few days, 260 Chinese were travelling on the Horsham and Lexton Road, 160 in the Upper Glenelg and a similar number by Casterton and Mt Sturgeon and nearly 300 were crossing the plains between Streatham and Ballaarat beside several smaller parties."
The Port Phillip Herald reported on the same day, "...one hundred and sixty four have landed from a vessel lately wrecked in Guichen Bay, arrived in Ballaarat yesterday after three weeks overland journey."
Of the 2,329 Chinese landing at Robe during January and February at least 700 were already in Victoria and 164 of them from the wrecked Phaeton had just arrived in Ballaarat.
Back in Robe Town a well known bullocky, John Edgeworth was finalising the unloading of a load of wool bales on to the Osprey.
His next venture would be to take another group of Chinese to the Victorian goldfields.
He was happy with his present circumstances; taking Chinese to the goldfields then picking up wool, or wheat, from Victorian stations on his return trip.
His wife Imelda appreciated their sudden change of fortune.
John's acting as a guide to the Chinese was very lucrative!
John's last trip had netted them about PS200.
He was hoping to make similar money this time.
Imelda had her heart set on a solid limestone house.
Soon they would be able to start construction.
She had already spoken to the local stonemason, Larry Cooper.
John Edgeworth was dependable, but easily provoked.
He had a quick temper and was not averse to using his fists.
His local watering hole was the Bush Inn on the outskirts of town; near the junction of the track to Penola and the track to the Coorong.
A bullocky's life was hard; often on the tracks in all sorts of weather.
Their use of colourful language was legendary.
They provided an essential service to the sheep stations, pastoralists and wheat farmers.
John had negotiated with a Chinese headman, Ah Wong to take a group of 300 Chinese to the Ballaarat goldfields.
He planned to leave in two days time.
Due to the untimely death of Elizabeth Blakely, and her subsequent funeral; John had out of respect put back his departure to Tuesday 10-March-1857.
The day dawned bright and sunny.
John brought his team and dray along Victoria Street; as close as he could to the Chinese camp.
The heavy items of baggage were loaded on to the dray.
Some sick Chinese were also hoisted aboard.
The rest of the Chinese were lined up single file along Davenport Street ready to follow John and his team.
Each Chinaman had a bamboo bow (pole) up to six feet long over one shoulder.
At each end of the bow was a basket with up to 35 pounds weight of belongings in each basket.
