This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

I'd seen Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking.
I remembered thinking, I can't begin to imagine what that would feel like.
It was incomprehensible.
I was paralyzed with fear now.
I fought vehemently to prove my innocence because I wasn't going to be in that room strapped to that bed, no way in hell.
"I'm telling you the truth.
After Randy told me this guy was Hamas he went out a third time and called me afterward and said the intel Paul gave the man was still innocuous, and even though the man was getting impatient he agreed it was progress and to continue working with Paul.
Randy and I debated again whether we should call the whole thing off and bring the evidence to the police.
But we decided to keep going.
"I didn't hear from him for like five days.
I thought he must've taken my money and run.
Then he finally called me on Friday and told me he was in Birch Bay because his mom is dying.
I told him maybe we should stop the investigation considering the circumstances.
He decided he wanted to keep going.
He told me he was going back out last Friday night.
He called me and said the man was pressuring Paul for more specific information and Paul told him he was going to walk away.
The man offered to give him another quarter million dollars.
"After I talked to my girlfriend that night, I realized I had to call the investigation off immediately; I couldn't let this transaction happen.
Whoever possesses this technology becomes an immediate military powerhouse and threat to Israel and the rest of the world.
I spent the next three days calling Randy over and over, leaving messages until his mailbox was full.
I was just about to leave my office to try and find him when you guys showed up."
"Okay, I've heard enough of this crap, Mr. Wright!"
Greg barked.
"You know Randy is dead!
You killed him!
Do you think we're morons?"
Again, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
"What the hell are you talking about?
Randy's dead?
Oh my God!"
"You know he's dead, you piece of scum, and I had to look his wife straight in the eyes and let her know her husband wasn't coming home that night!
He had kids who are going to grow up without a father!"
Greg pulled his gun out, a Glock-27, the firearm of choice for most law enforcement personnel.
"Greg, don't do it, man," John said.
"He isn't worth going to prison."
Greg put the lethal end of the firearm against my right temple.
I thought this was it.
I closed my eyes and waited.
"Greg, put the gun down!"
John said forcefully.
"Think about what you're doing!"
"This smooth talking punk deserves to die!"
"Leave it to a judge and jury," John said as he approached Greg, whose hands were shaking.
He removed his gun from its holster and pointed it at Greg.
"Put the gun down now!"
he commanded.
"You aren't gonna shoot me, John!
You want him dead just as much as me!"
"You're talking crazy, Greg," John said somewhat more calmly.
"I'll shoot you if I have to.
You're about to commit murder.
You'll be throwing your career and life away."
After what seemed like five minutes, but was actually about ten seconds, I could feel the end of the gun barrel being removed from my head.
Thank God, I thought as I opened my eyes.
I was happy just to be alive.
Greg was breathing hard and sweating profusely as he holstered his gun.
"What the hell were you thinking, Greg?"
John said.
"I don't know."
"Christ.
I thought I might actually have to shoot you."
"I've seen you on the range.
That's not why I didn't shoot.
I realized I have a wife and kids too to worry about.
That's the only reason this kid is still breathing."
"You're a real jerk, Greg," John said.
"That's a great story you told, Mr. Wright, but it's complete bull," Greg said, ignoring the insult.
"I have no idea what you're talking about," I said.
Greg slapped a photograph from the crime scene down in front of me.
I was stunned; it was ghastly.
I began to feel sick again.
"You have anything you want to say about that, Mr. Wright?"
he said.
"It's impossible!
None of this is possible!"
I paused for a moment and thought.
"The only explanation is I'm being set up.
Hamas must've found out Randy was following them, killed him and framed me for the murder.
Plus Randy knew me as Mr. Smith, not Mr. Wright.
I gave him a phony name because if you hear a conversation between a YPG employee and a foreign national you're supposed to report it immediately to your security office.
Every time I talked to Randy, he called me Mr. Smith, or Smith.
There wouldn't have been any reason for him to think I was anyone but Mr. Smith.
There's no way Randy would've known my real name, so those letters on the wall in that photo could only have been put there by someone who knew my real name.
Only the terrorist and Paul knew my real name.
They're obviously framing me."
"That would be a compelling argument if there was any evidence Randy knew you as Mr. Smith," Greg said.
"There has to be evidence in his office that has the name Mr. Smith on it--an appointment book, a notebook, anything," I said.
"Mr.
Wright, Randy's office was completely cleaned out," Greg said.
"All that was left was his body.
But you already know that."
Oh my God, this was the perfect frame.
They had every angle covered.
"No I don't because I didn't kill him!"
"Save it for the jury," Greg said with a smirk.
"Did you happen to know that Randy worked in this building for twenty-five years?
He was a highly decorated homicide detective and has a lot of friends still working in this office.
These people all want you dead.
Each of them would give their left nut to come in here and put a bullet in your head.
I almost saved them the trouble.
We're so freakin' PC these days we can't give you guys what you really deserve.
Instead, the taxpayers, including my partner and me, are going to have to foot the bill for your stay on death row, which I expect will be brief.
Did you know killing a police officer is a capital offense, and that alone gets you the death penalty?
Add espionage and they'll be itching to stick the needle in you.
Congratulations, Mr. Wright, you're now public enemy number one in this country.
Dillinger was a quire boy compared to you."
"This is insane!"
I pleaded.
"I'd never do anything to hurt that man!
He was probably the only PI in town that would've taken this case!
I respected him and considered him a friend!"
My last few words must've touched a nerve.
The hatred in Greg's eyes was palpable.
"You bastard!"
he roared.
"I should've shot you earlier!
You think anyone here would care?
They'd pin a medal on me!"
"Greg, relax," John said.
"You look like you're going to have a stroke."
Greg glanced at John, took a deep breath and exhaled before continuing.
"Oh, and I forgot to mention, we have an eyewitness who says he saw you leave the scene shortly after the murder."
That's impossible, I thought.
I'd never even been to his office.
"That person is lying!"
"Yeah, this is all just a big conspiracy isn't it, Mr. Wright?"
"No, not a conspiracy.
I'm being framed!"
"And how do you explain this?"
Greg placed a tape recorder on the table and hit the 'play' button.
It was communication between Paul and the terrorist.
But as I listened more closely I realized it was my voice on the other end of the conversation, not Paul's.
This has to be a nightmare, I thought, as I began to feel disoriented.
"That's impossible!"
I said again.
"I've never talked to that man in my life!
What the hell's going on?"
"We'll be back in a few minutes," Greg said.
I felt like throwing up and was shaking violently.
They came back about five minutes later.
"Mr.
Wright, during this interview we've been recording your voice and had a forensic expert compare it to the voice on the tape," Greg said.
"It was a ninety-percent match.
That's good enough for a jury to fry you.
I tell you what, I'll take the death penalty off the table if you help us find the terrorist; otherwise you're getting the needle."
"I don't even know this man," I said as the level of dread I was feeling continued to escalate.
"I have no idea where he is.
How the hell am I supposed to help you find him?
I'm being framed.
Why aren't you listening to me?"
