Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Have_as_requirement', 'tfidf': 0.5362426614319339, 'lexical_unit': 'take.v / demand.v / need.v', 'definition': "The obtaining of a Requirement state of affairs or the presence of a Required_entity is profiled as a prerequisite for the obtaining or occurring of a Dependent state-of-affairs.

He held it there for a second and closed his eyes, imagining the blackness.
The noise.
A rush of adrenaline went through him, but didn't quite reach the part of the brain that pulled the trigger.
A thought stopped him.
What if he didn't die?
Was this the right way to shoot?
He put the gun in his mouth momentarily, quickly changing his mind and resting it back against his temple.
This was the way.
- Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thine will be done.....
The Prime Minister wasn't a religious man, but it's surprising what the thought of impending, eternal nothingness can do to a man's beliefs.
- ....
Forever and forever.
Amen.
Silence.
Was he dead?
A tingle in his foot and a churn in his stomach advised him that he was still very much part of the material world.
He tried to focus.
Pull the trigger.
He wanted to.
Needed to.
He just couldn't send the signal from his brain to his finger.
The door knocked.
The handle rattled.
- Sir....Sir.....
Steve.
It was now or never.
Lex shut his eyes tight and allowed himself to drift.
- Sorry Eduardo.
He heard no bang, he felt nothing.
He was gone.
- Sir...Eduardo is back on the line.
Open the door. Sir....
Steve was too late.
Eduardo Rey died of a heart attack on the island of Ducie, a couple of moments after his counterpart had taken his own life at 10 Downing Street, London.
It was at Prime Minister Lex McGivern's insistence that his own counterpart be tracked down in order to run the island.
A moral safety net that afforded him the ability to live with what he was doing to the test subjects, but which arguably had credentials no more honourable than that of a suicide bomber.
Ultimately though, his plan had served its purpose.
The Prime Minister was able to take his own life to stop the man who was threatening to pull the plug on Ducie; his counterpart Eduardo Rey.
Had the Prime Minister been one of the many test subjects over the years that didn't seem to have a locatable counterpart, the whole story might have played out very differently, but as it was, the Prime Minister's CROP-fuelled sleep state led them to Eduardo.
The equivalent of PS3,000,000 up front and a further PS5,000,000 on completion of the project and Ducie had itself its first leader.
Eduardo had strongly suspected that he'd have been killed anyway had he declined.
He may well have been right about that.
Chapter 58.
Into the abyss
Adam Trundle isn't the first person to seemingly disappear without a trace.
History is fraught with examples of inexplicable disappearances that are accepted for no other reason than that there is no answer.
Or more so, that there are too many possible answers and not enough evidence to support the logical theories of murder, abduction or the simple fact that someone just didn't want to face life any more and decided to hide away from it instead.
Is it possible therefore that when the universe cannot find a logical way to dispose of a counterpart when his opposite number dies, it simply sucks them into the abyss or some alternative existence?
This is the question that Steve Towerbridge vowed to get to the bottom of in memory of his friend the Prime Minister, of Eduardo, of Lionel Martinez, of Andrea Fuentes and in what he assumed was the memory of Adam Trundle.
This would be the next stage of the counterpart project.
Whether to take the project public or to keep it under stress-inducing lock key would be another decision Steve would have to make.
All in good time though.
First, he had one phone call that just couldn't wait....
Chapter 59.
Do not do all you can
PC Kevin recognised Kate instantly as he steered the patrol car around a traffic island and onto the dual carriageway
- That's her there.
He pointed to an unfathomable figure in the distance.
- You sure Kev?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
I know that walk.
- Bingo!
Paul reached for the siren, but Kevin slapped his hand away firmly.
- She'll run if we start flashing blue you idiot.
Pull over just short of her there and follow me out.
Paul brought the car to a stop and the two men jumped out.
Kate turned round at the sound of car doors slamming and shaped to run away, but instantly thought better of it, whether due to sheer fatigue or the fact that she was still a good half a mile from the Institution, the only safe haven she knew of.
She stopped dead in her tracks and waited for the officers to catch up.
- Ok.
Do your thing boys.
Take me to the station.
- We're not going to take you in Kate.
You haven't broken the law as far as we know.
- They think I busted Adam out though don't they.
- They did.
Becky said you hadn't moved from the waiting room though.
- So what do you want from me?
- This place, the underground prison.
- The institution.
- That's the puppy!
- What about it?
- Take us there.
- You're wasting your time.
- So you made it up?
- If you like.
- Something tells me you didn't.
- Well you had a good laugh at me earlier when I mentioned it.
- Well since then, your buddy has apparently teleported himself out of a locked police cell.
I'm entitled to think anything's now possible.
So you'll take us there?
- Why?
- Well if what you're saying about the place is true, then it's something we need to be looking into.
Check it's all legit, you know.
The place isn't showing up on any register, so something must be up with it.
Who's running the gaff?
Immigrants?
Squatters?
- Government.
- Give me a break!
- It's government run.
You can raid the place if you like, but you'll be overridden once they call on the PM.
Then you'll be part of it, because you know the secret.
- What's the secret Kate?
- Look, you're better off turning round and going back to the day job.
Look for Adam.
Whatever.
You don't want part of this, trust me.
- But what if I do want part of it?
Kate looked Kevin in the eye, searching for some sign that would validate her trust in him.
- Just go, Kevin.
- But, Kate, I....
- Just go!
Kate shot Kevin a look that he recognised all too well.
A look that spoke of underlying truths.
That all was not what it seemed.
He got it.
- Well, ok.
We're going.
But if you change your mind....
He handed her a card with his name and number on.
Kate took it and feigned disinterest.
Kevin gestured to his colleague.
- Come on pal.
We're out of here.
And with that came the beginning of the end.
Chapter 60.
Permission
PC Kevin felt the satisfying, warm buzz of his mobile phone in his trouser pocket.
Sooner than he'd expected, but he'd known the message was coming.
He put the phone to his ear and navigated the maze of robotically spoken options that eventually lead him to one that advised, "You have one new voicemail".
The line crackled and what sounded like wind or traffic dominated the line for a few seconds before it was punctuated by the sound of someone clearing their throat.
- Hello?
Has it started?Right....
If you're sure you know what you're getting into.
Exactly where you just pulled the car in. 11pm.
Tomorrow.
Just you though, ok?
Ok...erm.... bye.
Chapter 61.
It's always the quiet ones
As Daniella Diaz's eyes opened, they were met by rays of the Ducie sun that didn't offer a soft and welcoming illumination of the day to come like they usually did, but instead attacked her retinas and pierced a cold tunnel of reality into her consciousness.
The weight of recent events fell on her from a height, crushing her under a torrent of bad memories.
Eduardo, Lionel, Andrea all dead.
Lucas missing, maybe even dead himself.
She couldn't allow herself to believe it.
She reached under her bed and retrieved the hand made box that Lucas had given to her the night of the beach party.
His words from that night replayed vividly in her head like a tape recording:
