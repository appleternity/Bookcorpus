In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

"So now my baby sister is in on this adventure?"
He narrowed his gaze and glared at his brother.
***
"The Michaels brothers."
A sultry voice behind him dripped with amusement.
"What could possibly bring you to the Mirage at this hour?"
Chase turned and swallowed.
His little sister's friend had certainly grown up.
But even with her stunning good looks, he couldn't think about anything but seeing Sam again.
"Maggie, you look fantastic."
Chris hugged her, and Chase watched her face turn a shade of crimson dark enough to match her jewelry.
When Chris finally released her, she extended her hand to Chase.
He shook it gently and smiled.
His brother had a good thing right under his nose.
Why couldn't he see it?
"If they were mates, they would know instantly.
Just like you did with Samantha."
I guess.
Chris was just playing the field then, because Maggie was still twenty-three.
"Thank you, Chris.
Y'all got here awfully fast.
They've only been here about twenty minutes.
I have a table for you boys just across from their booth."
"You are awesome!"
"You know I would do anything for Maggie's brothers, but do not harass them.
They are up in arms tonight about something.
One of them, poor girl, has been drinking like a sieve.
She has a high tolerance, even for a wolf, because she's not even tipsy yet."
Maggie looked up and met Chase's gaze.
"Can't believe it's me, huh?"
Chase chuckled and shook his head.
"Sorry.
It's been a while."
"That's what happens when you ship out of the country every couple of years."
He frowned and crossed his arms over his chest.
Her comment struck a little too close to home.
She reached out and touched his forearm.
"You miss getting to know family and friends."
He scanned the dark blue carpet and shifted his weight from one foot to the other.
"I'm sorry I didn't recognize you right away, Maggie."
She gave him a gentle smile and shrugged.
"It's fine, Chase.
You know this girl you want to talk to, Samantha Demakis, probably won't even speak to you once she knows what family you belong to.
The Demakises are hoity-toity with a side of stick-up-the-ass."
Chase laughed.
"So I've heard, but my wolf wants her.
I've got to try."
"We don't always get what we want, but I wish you the best of luck."
She tried to hide it--the flicker of fading hope mixed with sadness as from him and back to Chris.
He saw it.
He knew what that loneliness felt like.
Hell, he'd been alone the better part of a century.
She was only twenty-three years old.
Life was just beginning for her.
Maggie turned and let them into the VIP lounge.
Sam's scent assaulted his senses the moment the doors swung open.
She smelled like the forest after a fresh rain with a hint of honeysuckle.
If only he could sweep her off her feet and carry her away from whatever troubles were weighing her down.
His wolf whispered to his consciousness, "Something is troubling our mate."
Every cell in his body clawed to life, and his wolf stretched and rose to the surface.
The magic rippled within him, and for the first time in nearly fifty years he struggled to maintain his composure and his human form.
Sam met his gaze for a moment as Maggie led him and Chris to a table a mere ten feet away from the Demakis sisters' booth.
There were four women at the table, all wolves.
Two were twins and sported the same short, angled haircut to accentuate that point.
The third woman wore her hair long and flowing like Sam's, except it was reddish brown.
Sam's ash blonde hair was pulled back in a loose braid draped over the front of her shoulder.
Her eyes widened with surprise, and she put the highball glass she'd been nursing down on the tabletop.
***
"Sam?
Sam, have you heard anything I've said?"
Sam finally tore her gaze away from Chase.
When she'd seen him walk into the lounge, every part of her being began to ache.
Her wolf was going nuts, urging her to go over and talk to him immediately.
"He is here to see us!"
Sam glanced up at Nicole and then again at Chase.
God, he was smiling.
A huge, lolling, sexy grin.
Her heart melted into a puddle, and all she wanted to do was oblige her wolf, climb into his lap, and snuggle against his broad chest.
Nicole laughed, and Sam turned back with a glare.
"Out of the entire Vegas strip, soldier-boy hottie ends up one table across from you in your favorite haunt."
"Shhh...
Nicole, don't talk so loud.
He can hear you."
Her cheeks warmed, and she took another quick sip of her Jack and Coke.
"Ooooh, this is the hottie from the airport?"
Hallie giggled.
Sam put her empty glass down and looked up.
All three of her sisters were smiling and waving at Chase and his friend.
If only she could disappear into the leather of the seat cushion.
"Nicole, wave them over here to our booth.
I want to meet the guy that finally made Sam turn her head twice."
Tess snickered.
"It's not every day you get to see Samantha Demakis blush like a high school freshman."
"Shut up, Tess," Sam hissed and scowled at her little sister.
She wanted nothing more than to talk to Chase again but not surrounded by her sisters or in front of whoever his friend was.
Before she could object, Nicole had hopped up from their booth and walked over to the pair.
Sam stole another glance and shivered with excitement when both men stood and followed Nicole back to the table.
Tess and Hallie smirked and scooted around to the other side of the round corner booth so Chase could slide in next to her.
She glared at the twins, but it was too late.
They both giggled and shrugged.
Sam motioned for Nicole to sit next to her, but Nicole slid onto the opposite side.
The corners of Chase's lips turned up with amusement.
He took the place next to her in the booth, and the other man slid in next to Nicole.
Sam smiled at Chase but could feel the heat rising in her cheeks.
Why couldn't she get ahold of herself?
He was just a guy.
Granted, he was the first guy her wolf had ever shown any interest in, and it was making her horny and agitated.
"Hello again," Chase said softly.
His velvety voice sent tremors through her already aroused body.
She turned and met his mischievous gaze.
He knew I was here.
This meeting is not a coincidence.
It had to be Maggie.
Traitor.
Even though she was a little upset at Maggie, she was superbly pleased to be rubbing elbows with Chase Michaels.
"Maggie told you I was here."
Guilt registered in his eyes, and all conversation at the table halted.
All eyes were on Chase.
"Actually she told me."
The other man raised his hand.
Sam glanced toward him in confusion.
She'd never met this other man.
Why would he be looking for her?
"Who are you?"
She narrowed her eyes and waited.
"I'm Chris Michaels.
Chase is my brother and our little sister, Maggie, is good friends with--" "Oh my God!"
Sam cut him off.
"Your sister is the other Maggie!"
Chris nodded, and Chase shifted in his seat.
"How do you know our sister?"
Chase asked.
His deep voice stroked the chords of her soul.
Sam leaned back in her seat and laughed.
"I went to school with the Maggies.
We all graduated together."
She glanced over at Chase.
"How much older are you than your sister?
I never saw either of you at the house."
Chase flushed bright red and coughed.
"The house!
You were at my parents' house?"
"Yes," Sam answered with a smirk, loving the fact he was so surprised.
"Your mom makes the best lemon cake on the planet."
She licked her lips and stifled a sigh when his gaze clamped onto her mouth.
"That she does."
Chase smiled, and she could tell he was forcing himself to relax.
He laid an arm behind her along the back of the booth.
"Chris and I are only five years apart, but Maggie appeared decades later and surprised Mom and Dad.
Chris and I had already lived out of the house for a long time."
