This frame contains verbs that participate in the ditransitive construction, with a recipient as the direct object, as in the following: 'I sent Bill the manuscript.' Certain Verbs in this Frame focus on the initial sending act, while others do not.  For example, I sent it rapidly can either mean the act of sending was initiated quickly or that it moved quickly.

Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.'

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

That's why what remains of the population of Rim clings to the mountain peaks and plateaus," Gunner said.
"We didn't all have a nice, clean chain of islands to hide in when things started to go from bad to worse."
"How far does it go?"
"There isn't much of the continent that doesn't get at least a whiff of the stuff from time to time.
It's thickest here where the mountains funnel it up.
If you keep your eyes peeled while flying over the heart of the mainland you might catch sight of some stretches of land from time to time, but that's mostly at the whim of the wind and nothing you'd want to risk settling in."
"Where did it all come from?"
"If anyone ever knew that, they died along with most of the rest of us when it first showed up," Coop said.
"Alls we know for sure is that it came sudden, rolling in like a tide and catching most low-lying folk by surprise.
There weren't as many airships back then.
Barely any.
The folks who lived were mostly the folks at sea or already in the mountains, or the ones who could get there in a hurry."
"Enough history.
There'll be time enough for that later.
We'll have to hurry if we're going to be ready in time for our meeting with the fug folk we'll be trading with," Captain Mack said.
Nita watched the implausible urban landscape grow larger as they approached, but slowly something at the edge of hearing drew her attention.
It was a tone, pulsing at a quick and irregular rate.
"What is that?"
she asked.
"What?"
Lil asked.
"That sound.
It is sort of a ringing sound."
"I don't... oh.
You mean Wink doing the strut check."
She pointed to one of the rigid struts that attached the turbine mounting ring to the deck.
Wink had scurried up to the midpoint and was tapping at it vigorously.
"He always does a good hard check of that strut when we get close to port.
All inspectors do.
I reckon, since there is so much steering to do to pull into a dock, they've been trained to check to make sure it's good and strong before we get too close.
Shakes the whole envelope, and the sound carries forever.
If you listen close, you can probably hear other inspectors doing the same thing on all these other ships.
You just start to ignore it after a while."
"I don't remember him doing it on the Lagomoore Islands."
"I reckon even Wink realizes that place ain't no proper port.
He mostly does it at the busy spots.
Up and down Westrim and Circa, around the edge of the fug, places like that."
"Lil, get Nita down below and find her a mask that fits.
She paid us plenty to get her down to talk to those folks personally.
I want to make sure she's ready if they allow it."
"Aye, aye, Cap'n," she said.
She snickered and added under her breath, "Aye-aye.
Don't that beat all?"
Lil took her below decks and led the way to a supply room on deck three.
It was filled with canisters and a handful of bizarre masks.
They were made from leather and rubber, with copper fittings and a circular vent on the front.
Large enough to fit firmly over the mouth, they had long, thin belts to keep them in place.
"Here you go.
Try that one on for size," Lil said.
"That's the one we keep for guests.
Might want to tap it out first.
They can get dusty, and the last thing you want is a lungful of dust on your first breath down there."
Nita knocked it against the wall, then held it over her mouth and took a breath.
"It is a little hard to breathe with this on," she said.
Remarkably, it was well designed enough that it barely muffled her voice at all.
"Not half as hard as it is to breathe without it on once you get down there.
It'll sting your eyes a bit, too, but only at first.
If that bothers you, Gunner's goggles are good for that.
Not yours or mine, though, what with the vents and all.
I gotta tell you, I don't envy you going down to talk to those folk.
You think Wink can give you the creeps.
Every time I see one of those fug folk I feel fit to crawl out of my skin."
"Are they that bad?"
"Heh.
You'll see, I guess.
Take that with you, get your bag with your payment, and let's go."
Chapter 11 The Wind Breaker drifted over the city and moored on the fugward side, facing into an almost mystical scene.
Just as was the case on the seaward side, the mountains here were perilously steep, forming almost a sheer drop.
The dock rose at the end of a long string of lower hilltops connected by suspension bridges.
There, a tall tower with massive iron wheels held wires that led down into the fug.
Their berth was as near as possible to the cable tower, just a short walk away from the small building at its base.
The crew gathered at the railing beside an embossed sign that had formerly labeled the tram with what looked to be a long and official name.
At some point in the past someone had helpfully slathered it with paint reading Fugtown Express.
Captain Mack clicked open his stop watch.
"So long as the tram is on time, we'll make it.
Coop, the sack."
Coop held out a small canvas bag.
"Samples of our wares, and an up-to-date manifest of all available goods."
"We used some on repairs, don't forget."
"Taken into account, Cap'n."
He nodded.
"Ms.
Graus, are you certain you still want to come along?
It won't be pleasant."
"My mother's health depends on this.
I want to be sure that everything that can be done will be done," she said.
"Get your mask on then, and make sure you've got everything you brought to trade.
I'll talk to the man on the tram, but he'll be expecting you, so the decision will have already been made."
"Did you send a message ahead somehow?"
"They're the fug folk.
They'll know.
The rest of you, you're on leave for a few hours.
Decide among yourselves who stays with the ship and meet back there in two hours.
Depending on how this goes, we'll see what's next for us.
And if they have any breadfruit at the market, buy a piece for Wink."
The crew didn't wait around to be told twice, vanishing down the catwalk and toward the city proper.
"Now listen closely.
It doesn't matter that you hold the purse strings.
When it comes to dealing, the fuggers have all the power.
Treat these folk as royalty.
Speak only when they speak to you.
Be respectful.
You're as close as your country's ever had to a diplomat to the fug, so you'd best act like it."
"I'll conduct myself properly."
He looked up to the slowly grinding wheel, then checked his watch again.
"Sounds like it's close.
Say what you want about these folk, they keep to their schedule."
Far below, the purple mist parted and an ornate tram rose out of the fug.
It was a work of art, as exquisite as anything Nita might have found in her own land.
Looping gold-plated filigree covered the outside.
The brass-work was polished to a glorious sheen, and the wood was flawless ebony.
"It's... magnificent."
"What did you expect?"
"Well, from the way you've described them, I expected a ferryman guiding something from the gates of hell."
"Mmm.
And who's to say this ain't what that looks like?"
The tram pulled level with the catwalk, and the doors slid open.
From inside poured a dense purple fog that swirled about their legs.
Even through her leather and canvas leggings, the stuff felt strangely cold.
When enough of it drained from within the tram, a man became visible.
Nita's breath caught in her chest.
He was gaunt, almost skeletal about the face and wrists.
His hair was black with streaks of pure white.
He wore it slicked back.
Every feature of his face was sharp, with a beaklike nose and pronounced cheekbones.
His clean-shaven face revealed every deep line in his stoic expression.
Every exposed patch of flesh was an ashen-gray color.
Thin eyebrows arched haughtily above the most unsettling eyes she had ever seen.
The pupils were enormous, easily twice as large as her own, as large as a normal person's iris.
Around them, a thin ring of gold bled quickly into orange and then a deep red where the whites should have been.
His hands were practically talons, long and slender with bony knuckles and black nails.
His spine had a serpentine bend to it, hunching down at the top and swooping forward again at the base.
It gave his body the vague shape of a question mark.
In contrast to his ghoulish appearance were his clothes.
They were as elegant as the tram, made from the finest silk and tailored to fit his twisted body expertly.
He wore a black suit jacket with tails.
A single black button was fastened, revealing a black silk vest and a white lace ascot.
His slacks were straight-cut and led down to black socks and pointed black shoes polished to a glassy finish.
He looked to the two of them, turning first to the captain.
"Captain McCulloch West.
Punctual as always.
A pleasure to be working with you again.
Step inside, please."
His voice was as sharp and cold as his features.
He turned to Nita.
"Miss Amanita Graus.
It is my great honor to be the first of my people to address a Calderan."
He removed a set of white gloves from his pockets and slipped them on before holding out his hand.
"Please, let me help you aboard."
She glanced to the captain, then took the offered hand and stepped aboard.
