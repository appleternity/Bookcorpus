To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Call for Independence From Texas: Do Not Let the Rightwing Loons Take Us Out of the USA!
We Will Make the New American State of Aztlan!
The most patriotic group in Texas, the most reliably gung ho super Americans...They are Mexicans!
Mexican-Americans, probably some of you would insist on calling us, or Latino, or Hispanic.
But we're not from Hispania!
Or any other mythical place in Anglo imaginations.
We will not let you pretend we are Europeans when most of us don't have family from there.
We are Mexicans plain and simple, and proud to be called that.
Not Mexican American as a label most of us drop because it's too long to say, unless Cheech Marin is joking about it in that cool song he sang while Chong played terrible guitar.
Just Mexicans, and it doesn't matter if you confuse us with Mexicans from Mexico.
Land and culture don't necessarily tie to nation.
Mexico's government doesn't inspire loyalty, even within Mexico, not even to Mexican citizens.
But American government, except for the pinche migra and abusive cops, does.
It inspires passionate devotion in Mexicans both US-born and immigrants, and even so called illegals, those without papers.
As a nation and a government, America inspires love, like Romeo was inspired by Juliet, like Mary was inspired by the angels sent by Almighty God.
Meanwhile, at the same time, the most disloyal, the most distrusting traitorous people in Texas are a peculiar strain of Anglo conservatives and Republicans.
Not old time small government pragmatic conservatives who want less regulation, but angry, vindictive, hostile, foaming at the mouth, how-dare-anyone-disagree-with-me types.
They rant about lynching, shooting, or executing politicians or appointed officials for imagined offenses, see black helicopters in the sky, and sinister re education camps in Black and brown inner city kids going off to Job Corps.
There are none more disloyal as to see all government as "tyranny."
Anarchists, but without any sense of community except their common hatreds, and without any sense of cooperation except to make sure the average working man can't do that same cooperation for better wages.
They want others to have the right to work for less than minimum wages and die in the street or the emergency room because of no insurance.
They are Social Darwinists who hate Darwin almost as much as they don't understand him.
They are Hobbesians who haven't thought it through, even while driving a car made safe by government standards down a highway (not toll roads) paid for by government on the way to a Fourth of July or Memorial holiday celebrating victories won by soldiers (the ultimate bureaucracy) and not mercenaries.
The more extreme conservative white Texas may see government as evil, but Texas Mexicans, Tejanos, sure don't.
We wish there was more of it, doing more.
Being your brother's keeper, after all, is a good Catholic principle, as it was a good indigenous tribal principle less than a century and a half ago when most Mexicans were still in tribes.
Half a dozen generations haven't erased the fealty to that principle, only circumstances called for a transfer of it to the church and even more so to the nation-state.
Like any good socialist instinct, most Mexicans know We The People Are The Government.
It is not some outside oppressing force, as white conservatives often believe.
So I'm pretty fed up with these radical conservative (or maybe rightwing anarchists) Anglos bashing We The People.
I want to stay part of the United States!
I don't want to be dragged out of it by these loons!
And I know many of you agree with me.
Yes, I've done my share of protests over the years.
But I would never have done them if I didn't care, care deeply, passionately, with all my heart, about this country and its people, all of its people.
I also care deeply about a nation that (some cops and government agents aside) lets me do all the protesting I've done by word, deed, pen, and with my big mouth.
I couldn't get away with half of this in Mexico, and my ancestors have been here since before Stephen Austin and Sam Houston, and way before Davy Crockett's foolish little trip.
That's why you see so many deeply loyal, deeply patriotic Mexicans.
That's why so many of us are over in Iraq and Afghanistan, in uniform.
And that's why most Mexicans want nothing to do with this crazy, unpatriotic, disloyal, verminous, traitorous, malformed, pipe dream foolish notion of a so called independent nation of Texas.
Texas was a lousy nation for a Mexican to be trapped in before, a place where you'd get killed by a racist Anglo at the drop of a hat, with your daughter raped and dishonored.
That will happen again if they should somehow succeed and secede.
So, first thing: Stop the crazy drive towards secession.
Second thing, and the easiest way to make sure secession can't succeed: Break away from Texas!
Send them a message!
The law says quite clearly we have the right to do so.
(Unlike their crazy claim of being able to secede.
Que chingas es eso!
Que pendejos!)
Texas can break into as many as five states.
OK, let's make one of them the new state of Aztlan, named after the Aztec homeland, which may well have been Texas anyway.
Everything in a line from Del Rio to San Antonio to Corpus Christi, all the way south, should be the new state of Aztlan.
El Paso and the western panhandle, why don't you form your own state too?
You have more in common with New Mexico than Texas.
Austin, they have never liked you progressives, greens, and free thinking artistic types.
Why not break away and form your own state?
And west Texas Mexicanos, why not form your own state too?
I know it can't be easy out there for you, surrounded by Bible Belt types, such as Rick Perry himself.
What would it say to the world if Rick Perry's own hometown does not want to be part of Texas anymore?
How much easier will life be for us to never have to listen to rightwing fundamentalist Christian conservatives again?
These are people constantly trying to refight the Civil War, but along religious lines.
They are American Taliban against everyone else.
How much easier will life be for us to never have to put up with nonsense like Official English or immigrant bashers who don't stop to think that we Mexicans have been here far longer than them, or their ancestors?
And these new states, these will all definitely be blue states, free from red state domination.
They want secession?
Secede from Texas!
Aztlan Now!
Sincerely, Carlos Guerrero
Guerrero's editorial sent a shockwave throughout the state.
Within days, numerous volunteers set up Aztlan Now petitions for statehood, websites, organizing drives, and sought out their elected officials to press their calls for separation from Texas.
Aztlan Now movement members had the simplest approach.
"Do you want to leave America?"
"Hell no!"
was the typical answer of most Texans, about 70%.
But for white Republicans (frankly there weren't that many Republicans in the state who weren't white), about half wanted secession.
For Mexican-Americans, the numbers were a strong statement of patriotism and loyalty, over 95% opposing secession and treason.
For Democrats (the majority of whom in the state were Mexican) numbers ran over 80% against secession.
Blacks were even more opposed, over 98%.
Just like with the Confederate symbol, nearly all nonwhites can see the Texan symbol and identity does not include them.
Unfortunately most of the Black population lived in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, or in the many east Texas small towns.
A few Black leaders considered a separate state for Black Texans, but there was no way to form one with a Black majority short of the craziest kind of gerrymandering.
Many joked (and some seriously planned for) how they would leave Texas if secession somehow succeeded.
Getting support from some segments of the general public was one thing.
Mostly the newness of the idea was the largest barrier.
But unlike most white Texans, most Black or Latino or "other" Texans aren't heavily invested in the idea of Texan identity.
The same is true of plenty of leftist white Texans, who see people with pride in living in or being from Texas as hicks at best, rednecks at worst.
Getting support from political leaders was much harder.
Most feared being labeled as fringe thinkers, and if the separate states idea was not carried out, relations with their fellow politicians on the other side of the aisle would be that much more difficult.
Outside of some small town councilmen and a few state congressmen, most elected leaders in the future Aztlan had a wait and see approach.
Of all the media, Fox was predictably the most hysterical and angry.
Hannity went on a tear, insisting without proof, like always, that these groups were somehow "racist."
O'Reilly, true to form, repeated a slur he had used in the past, calling the movement "led by wetbacks."
Limbaugh also repeated some prior race baiting of his.
"Lazy Mexicans...I didn't know they had it in them to work hard for anything."
Michael Savage, of course, was somehow convinced it was all a conspiracy by Muslims.
Probably the funniest reaction came from Bill Maher.
On his New Rules segment he took a shot at Perry and the secession vote:
"New Rule- Conservatives, you can't call yourself patriots...if you want to leave America or overthrow America!
It's getting pretty screwy when a Mexican named Carlos is showing himself to be a one hell of a lot more patriotic than any of you white guys!
(The audience laughed and cheered.)
When did conservatives become so disloyal?
Remember when conservatives used to say 'Love it or Leave It?
Now they don't love America anymore, and they want to leave it!"
(The audience laughed and cheered again, followed by applause.)
The strongest reaction to the editorial actually came from secession supporters.
Guerrero received his first death threats within minutes of the essay being published.
His email and voicemail overflowed with angry secessionists spouting bile and venom.
Racist taunts accompanying most threats were about what one would typically expect: "If you know what's good for you beaner..."
"Go back to Mexico you commie..."
"I'll shove a shotgun up your wetback greaser ass..."
But Guerrero could not arm himself in self-defense.
In 1979, he had been caught smuggling several pounds of marijuana across the border.
The jury included two Latinos, and they and an Anglo member had voted to acquit him.
With a split decision, he would have gone free.
But the judge intervened, ruled that the dissenting jurors were ignoring clear evidence of lawbreaking, and declared Guerrero guilty.
The judge sentenced him to the maximum of twenty years to life as a "large scale" smuggler.
Public outrage at the heavy handedness and clearly political motive for the harsh sentence became a minor cause celebre.
Two years of appeals followed, with Guerrero finally getting time served and the rest of the sentence suspended.
But no governor had ever granted him a pardon, so he was not allowed to either own or carry a gun.
Getting a pardon in Texas, while technically a rigorous process screened by the governor's office, was usually a routine matter bureaucratic procedure.
But no governor ever wanted to be seen as soft on crime, especially with a famous leftist radical and drug smuggler.
Guerrero would never get a pardon.
For protection, Guerrero had to turn to moving from friend's house to friend's house, keeping an irregular schedule, and always living and traveling with those who could possess a gun legally.
College students groups or veterans' groups were most often his bodyguards.
At a news conference, a reporter asked Rick Perry what he thought of the burgeoning breakaway movement from Texas.
Governor Perry's reaction was as ignorant and reckless as on anything else he typically said: "Oh, it doesn't worry me one bit.
I know we've got a great state, and I know most of our Hispanic voters want to stay part of it.
Tell you what, I'd even let them put it to a vote!
County by county, why not?
I bet you right now every last county would vote to stay part of good old Texas."
The reporter couldn't believe his ears.
"Will you commit yourself to allowing a vote, Governor?
Will you publicly promise that?"
"You bet!
I'll make you a bet right now, I'll eat your hat if these breakaway movements get anywhere."
True to his word, Perry confidently pushed for a resolution in the state legislature, and used his bully pulpit to rush it through.
The state's Republicans and conservative Democrats, confident any breakaway movement would never succeed, voted for Perry's "Loyalty to Texas" resolution.
So did the minority and progressive members of the legislature, eager to placate their own voters.
The resolution read:
Be it resolved that Texas has nothing but people who are loyal to this great state, once an independent republic.
That Texas, in the finest republican tradition, wishes to give its citizens an opportunity to show their loyalty.
Therefore the State of Texas, and formerly an independent republic, will hereby allow each individual county to vote whether to form any separate state, to remain part of the State of Texas, or to join any return to an independent Republic of Texas.
When Guerrero first heard Perry's public declaration, he could not believe his ears and good fortune.
Seemingly this allowed Texas to balkanize.
Potentially there could be individual isolated counties side by side, some breaking away, some remaining part of the state.
And were Texas to actually secede, there could be war as vicious as the Balkans had.
It was more important than ever to make certain entire regions voted to break away.
But this also gave Aztlan Now a firm legal footing.
Now the only thing necessary was to win the hearts and minds of local voters.
And both Perry and the secessionists were making that so easy!
