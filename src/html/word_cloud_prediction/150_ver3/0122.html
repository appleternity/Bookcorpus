LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

'I would rather discuss politics with anyone but him.'   'World leaders met to discuss global warming on the coldest day of the year.'"}, {'frame': 'Calendric_unit', 'tfidf': 0.9364122859221946, 'lexical_unit': 'April.n / autumn.n / June.n', 'definition': "Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Trendiness differs from Popularity in adding a factor of aesthetic or other judgment to behaviors and individuals, and judging these with respect to social behavior; Popularity is about amount of acceptability or utilization based on general (often non-aesthetic) desirability.  'Wearing flowered brocaded silks was fashionable in the first few years of the decade.'"}, {'frame': 'Communication', 'tfidf': 0.9290901670940067, 'lexical_unit': 'communicate.v / codeword.n / speech.n', 'definition': "A Communicator conveys a Message to an Addressee; the Topic and Medium of the communication also may be expressed.  This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

Note that Item should be annotated on a second layer, except in cases when the noun structure the ordinal participates in is predicative.  'The first car from the left is a Magosix.'

All hand to your designated positions.
Fire team assemble forward of the main engine room, move, move move!"
He broadcast.
Sk'lar was checking his watch.
The crew slowly fumbled around in confusion getting to their positions.
They weren't used to this sort of drill, and didn't expect it on this mission.
It was 4 minutes and 40 seconds later.
"Fire team reports being in position at the forward engine room, the rest of the crew is assembled at the skiffs and have life boats ready to deploy."
Karl offered.
"Ready to deploy what?"
Sk'lar asked.
"Ready to deploy.....
Sir?"
Karl asked, not being used to this kind of strict discipline.
"That's right Mister Hampton, this isn't the Navesink Bay or the Raritan, this is critical here, and I need you to get that response time cut in half by the time we get there.
Push only as much as you have to, Karl.
Finally on board with this sudden change to an authoritarian style of command, Karl say the logic and need of this, and said to Sk'lar, "I've got this, Sky."
"Don't worry, Karl, I won't be the kind of hard ass Michael can be.
Professor Mazza rode me as well, and there's a reason why.
If you want a hard ass my dad should have been here... that was fair, but slow, and if there was an emergency out here we could die fast.
I can't stress enough that this isn't inshore sample and testing, this is the real deal, and we need to be ready for anything out there."
First Mate Hampton realized just how right Sk'lar was.
"Yes, Sir, Captain Duncan.
Thank you, Sir."
he said half sarcastically, remembering mandatory civil service and civil militia drills he had when he was younger.
Strict military style discipline was rare, but was a part of every citizen's life and training.
They would have to all be sharp and couldn't afford any mistakes when dealing with an animal the size of their boat.
"I want the lead team assembled in the mess at 0700 hours.
We'll keep all clocks set to Eastern time for the duration of this trip, and verify time when there is any question or dealing with other ships at sea.
I want a status report on the Hornet and Wicked Wind as of 0630 hours, and to have both ships and the Navy cruiser and cargo ship if they're available skyped in, if not, transmitted by radio to them.
I want everyone in the loop.
We are about 18 hours out, and I want a position on the whale as soon as possible."
"I have that, captain."
Micky, the communications officer had just finished talking on the radio and typing on the computer terminal.
"The whale is at 32.511036 by minus 64.689560, just north of Bermuda.
The Al Gore reports she has been rocking her body up and down from time to time, but otherwise is just swimming slowly and drifting in place.
There are four other whales nearby, one is smaller than the other three."
"Set course for that location and bring this boat up to full speed, Mister Hampton.
Assign someone to the helm right away.
Get everything else together as I requested and call me if you need me.
I will be in the mess getting things ready for this mornings meeting.
Tell the crew they can eat when we're done, and that when I inspect this boat later it better be right.
I'm blind until then.
Am I clear, and do you have that?"
Sk'lar asked with authority.
"Yes, Sir" came his reply.
He leaned into Karl's ear.
"I'm not really a hard ass, in fact I hate that, but this crew will need to be tight and it's our job to have them on the ball so they have to think I'm a dick at first.
I need everyone focused and if they think this is a whale watching cruise they're in for a rude awakening, yo..."
he smiled...
Karl understood and smiled just a little.
He turned.
"Your heard the captain, this ship needs to be right and people need to get busy" He told Micky, who got on the com and was talking to someone below.
These were college students, and not used to having to really follow any kind of serious command structure, but Sk'lar would make sure they were as foicused as they could be when they got there.
Everyone had assembled in the mess and the skype was broken into four screens.
The Hornet and the Wicked Wind on top, the N.A.N. Al Gore, and Michael Mazza in his office.
When everyone was assembled and after introductions, which Julsey handled for him, Sk'lar started.
Good morning everyone.
As you know we are 16 hours away from Bermuda where a 25 meter very pregnant blue whale seems to be having difficulty giving birth.
The first report of her and her unusual activity actually came from a fisherman on Bermuda who made a general distress call for help, then a cargo vessel spent time observing her and a deckhand who has an interest in whales recognized there may have been a problem and that she was about to calf.
Since then the Al Gore has been shadowing her, and had ceased using radar or sonar to keep a fix on her in case that bothered her, which is why there was no confirmed location overnight.
I have reviewed as much as I could and have skyped the only two experts on marine mammals I could find, and they said she indeed must be sick or is having a problem delivering.
I'm going over my strategy here this morning, and after I finish would appreciate any feedback any of you might have either openly or in confidence through email."
Mike Mazza smiled a little, very proud of his former student and current friend.
"I will need the Al Gore to maintain a fix on her.
Speaking of which, we have to name her, so for lack of anything better how does 'Big Mama' sound to everyone?"
He paused and when no one objected, he went on.
"When we get there we stay tight with each other and come in slow, staying about a kilometer off.
If we seem like a threat we might have an issue with a bull, but blues were said to be peaceful from everything I read; but remember, there never was much interaction with this species even before the Reset, so we just don't know, and better stay safe.
The Watson will approach slowly and try to get as close as she can under electric drive.
I and two volunteers will then enter the water in dive gear and slowly approach Big Mama and try to get photos and sonograms of her belly and see what we can.
I myself will attempt to take a small tissue and blood sample for testing to determine if she's sick.
Until we know more that's as far as I've got.
We don't know what is going on, and we have to try to determine what is going on with her before we even think about making any plans, eh."
"Right now, though, I need people to come up with scenarios and contingencies so we have options ready.
I will need Doctor Planter, Denise here and Louis to familiarize yourselves with whale anatomy and learn as much about their biology and whale birth issues as possible before we get there, so cram please as much as you can.
One of the major complications big whales have which responsible for infant mortality is a condition where the placenta comes out first.
If that happens we have real issues and might lose the mother.
We also have the other blues in the area to consider, how they will act."
"Professor Mazza spoke up, "I have seen a few rights and humpbacks born, and baleen whales are a little different than toothed whales and dolphins.
I don't think we have much to worry about when it comes to the other whales in the vicinity.
We do have to worry about Mama there, and yous guys need those biological samples taken and done before anything.
Sk'lar messaged me last night and told me how off schedule this birth was for blues, they normally give birth in tropical areas in the winter, so we don't know if this is a preemie or what is going on here.
Their gestation period is normally over ten months and under a year, so we might be dealing with a fetus only six months old and a very sick mother who may be aborting.
We need the medical data first."
Mazza finished.
John Planter spoke.
"She might be early or she may be near her time and just sick, or there might be things physically wrong.
A calf cannot survive without it's mother, so the life of the mother comes first here."
A few people vocalized their agreement.
"So, we have it.
I have sent you all email with assignments and what I have so far.
I expect reports for our next meeting at 2300 hours Eastern.
Al Gore, will you keep us updated and can you keep a line of communication open until we get on site?"
"Affirmative" Joesph LaCroix responded.
"We will maintain contact and are free to remain and assist, but there is a very recent complication.
There is a tropical depression that threatens Bermuda.
It is currently heading northeast but has slowed and if it turns north or northeast we may be facing rough seas."
He was from Montreal and stationed in Annapolis in the Province of Washington.
The former United States and Canada, and some parts of Mexico, had joined together in a political union after the Reset.
Europe was also under one unified coalition as well.
They weren't exactly nations, it was more like a system of enlarged counties which were called provinces, which actually held the most political power, and then there were regional states, such as New England, The Hudson, Amishlund, New Washington, The Carolinas, all running down the Atlantic Coast.
The North American Navy did the job the navy did before the Reset, but also the Coast Guard and the EPA as well.
Their mission was stewardship of the seas and those who sail upon them.
Service was for no more than 25 years at sea, the longest of any kind of civic or military style of service.
Some public service careers needed people with lifelong skills and positions.
"Understood Sir, thank you, we have been watching that as well but did not know it had stalled or might turn.
Please keep us informed".
Sky asked his peer.
The N.A.N. Would have the best weather data of anyone.
"Will do Watson, ahhh, will keep an open channel and advise you any changes.
If nothing else, Sir, I shall attend to other matters and exit conversation now."
The navy captain said with his lite post French-Canadian accent.
Those in conference said goodbye to him and realized the meeting was about over.
"I need some sleep myself if I'm going to be worth a damn... thank you all."
Sky said as he excused himself.
Julsey on his six they were making their way to their quarters, and he turned and slowed and she joined him at his side despite the narrow space.
"How did I do?"
he asked seeking a critical review and honest answer.
He had been nervous, but it didn't show.
"You did great.
Everyone has their assignments and you're doing what any good manager does, getting the best people doing what they do best.....  you should be proud."
she said.
"I was nervous as shit, yo.... this is more than I'm used to."
He confessed.
"You did fine, you were amazing and professional.
Your professor was smart in assigning you to this, and I'm really proud to be here with you."
They entered the cabin and locked the door.
She began to undress him.
"Let me take care of you."
the words came spaced as she stripped him.
When he was naked before her she slid down before him and eased him back onto the bunk.
He fell backwards and lightly hit his head.
"You okay?"
she asked as if she had done it herself and was responsible.
"Just fine, come here."
He started to try undress her as much as she had undressed him, but could only remove her top, and she sat straddled on his legs devouring him and making him squirm, taking charge of him.
He flinched and quivered.
"Payback's a bitch" she said in a laugh.
Chapter Nine The slept as the storm had turned over the course of the afternoon.
They would have about a day before the effects of the storm created any issues for them once they got there, so it was now a race against time.
Orion slept at their feet, and when he woke up his dog was staring him dead in the eyes.
He looked at this beautiful woman next to him and knew what the terms "complete and happy" meant when used together.
He stroked her hair, then he asked Orion, "you seem to like her, I guess we keep her."
Orion responded to this by wagging his tail and creeping up the bed inbetween them, licking him frantically and then her, waking her up.
"That's somewhat normal, better get used to it."
he told her.
She gave the dog hugs and kisses, which made him jump out of bed and let out just a few happy barks.
It was 1920 hours and time good enough to get up.
Neither had slept that hard or well in days, distracted or occupied with other things as they had been.
