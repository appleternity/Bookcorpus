This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI.

To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ?

'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Dead_or_alive', 'tfidf': 0.47094557514119945, 'lexical_unit': 'life.n / alive.a / dirt nap.n', 'definition': "A Protagonist is in the dynamic, maintained state of being alive or has exited this state.

The lighting was so poor in here he felt like an old person in need of glasses.
As his eyes adjusted, his jaw opened and he said squeamishly, "Raina?"
This entire revelation gained him ten years to his looks.
It wasn't until he'd seen her in the light fully that he began to remember.
She cowered, taking another swish.
"Hi, how are ya?"
"Oh."
"Well, I guess he did technically win the bet, but we weren't really dating.
At least, we said we were.
But I just knew we were better as friends."
"What?
I'd never have guessed.
Well, Diana and I had a similar situation.
Except it was more of a guilt issue."
She nodded in understanding.
"Yup.
Nothing he did, nothing I did.
Just wasn't meant to be.
But I guess you could blame it partially on that awful dinner.
Now, was that your idea or his?"
He chuckled just a moment, afraid to answer truthfully.
"Oh, Raina.
I'm so sorry.
If it helps, we aren't exactly on a good page.
I think I'm getting all the little sayings confused.
We're still kinda fighting right now."
"What?
He never mentioned anything about it.
But I mean, we did break up right after that horrible dinner.
Oh, dear Lanta.
That was so bad."
Drew leaned back.
The bar was anything but crowded, and he wondered why out all the places in the world he would show up here for a Diet Coke.
Then he remembered how he'd been driving through the streets, thinking of how he should go over to Diana's and fight for her to the death.
He didn't love her, but maybe someday he would.
Yet something kept him driving on that warm afternoon, propelling him forward like some sort of manifest destiny.
Then he remembered all that had happened.
Nervously, he laughed, heartily and monstrous.
A couple sitting at one of the Formica tabletops turned to stare at him, and Raina raised an eyebrow.
"You okay?"
He continued to laugh so hard that he could feel his insides chortling.
Eventually, he stopped and had to cough.
"Oh, Raina.
I made this bet.
With God."
"Okay?"
she asked, twirling around a ring on her pinkie finger.
"I told him, 'I haven't been very nice to you, but send me where I'm supposed to go.'
And here I am.
At a freaking bar.
And then walks in Raina Newton, my best friend's girl..."
"Let me interrupt you there.
I am not his girl."
"You are his woman."
"No, definitely not what I meant."
"Well, what did you mean?"
She shrugged, twisting the chair just a little.
"Want to know something horrible?"
"Sure."
"I came to this bar, when I have been a teetotaler all my life, because my mom is getting hospice care tomorrow.
Maybe I'm just being sentimental, but, Drew, you should stop beating yourself up."
He almost said, "I'm sorry," but then he remembered how much he'd hated all the "I'm sorry" chitchat back when his own father died.
He paused long enough to clear his throat before catching just a glimpse of her out of the corner of his eye.
The broken light bulb pulsated like a vein above them, but in the glow, Raina looked very wise.
"So, we're in the same boat of misery."
"I wouldn't call it misery.
A lot of people don't get time with their parents at all.
I love my mom.
It's more of the fact that she was really rooting for Chris and me, you know?
But I always knew it would never work out."
It was like she was his favorite type of music.
The way she talked, the way she sighed almost constantly, like every statement was life-altering.
He tried not to stare at her too much.
He thought back to their first meeting, and how a wave of panic had crushed him in the undertow.
But of course, here he was, in an illicit situation yet again.
Did he only like women who had an intimate connection to his close friends and/or family members?
"I saw you once.
I was with my mom.
She told me you were staring at me."
He almost choked again.
"When?"
"You were on a date with this girl.
I can't even remember where.
You and I caught a glimpse of each other, and my mom made some comment about you.
I think she liked you, and she doesn't like people much anymore."
Every word she said was a melody, every breath a punctuated note.
He realized grimly that even though he hadn't had a sip of booze, his mind was befuddled with the dramatics of the past few months.
He wanted clarity.
"Raina?"
"Yes?"
"I remember."
Something caught in her throat.
The door behind them opened, a breeze following the guest.
Raina was quiet as Drew stared at her, and she finally caught his gaze.
"You remember?"
"Yes.
I never told you, but yes, I remember."
The way he said it, the pain in each syllable.
"I...
I should go."
She stood up, grabbing her rain jacket and purse.
"Raina?"
he asked, not looking over his shoulder.
He watched as the bubbles fizzled upward in his glass.
"Will you wait?"
she asked quickly, still standing above him.
"If this destiny stuff you're talking about...
If it's real.
Will you wait for me?
If we can stand it without the pain, and the guilt, and all the stupid reality?"
"Yes, Raina.
If it's right, I will wait."
She was gone, but a trace of her perfume remained beside him.
Chapter Forty-One
MID-APRIL, FOUR WEEKS post-breakup.
She didn't count the days.
She only used them as a guide to see when the last time she'd showed up was.
Raina knocked on the door at Aunt Ellie's apartment complex.
The old woman appeared, her long gray dreadlocks always so mesmerizing.
Raina tried not to stare.
"Rain!
We've missed you so much.
It's been a few weeks."
"Four," Raina stated simply.
"I'm sorry.
I've been between a rock and a hard place, but I'm here."
"Raina?"
called out Kelsey from the couch.
She sat by her computer, where she was talking into a little program that wrote for her on a Word document.
"No.
Erase.
Erase Raina."
Kelsey turned in her swivel chair and smiled.
"Where have you been?"
"Hey!
You working on another speech?"
"She's been busy on it for three weeks.
It's for a church thing in Dallas.
We're going to be leaving next weekend, flying out together for a little girls' weekend away period."
Kelsey's blue eyes sparkled.
"I'm so excited, Rain.
I wish you could come."
"Me too."
Kelsey's eyebrows furrowed.
"Oh, Rain.
I'm sorry."
"No, no, don't be.
She's still alive," Raina said, her breathing now erratic.
Aunt Ellie wrapped an arm around her shoulders.
"She's doing good, actually.
