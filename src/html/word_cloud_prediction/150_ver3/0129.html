The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.  In both frames, such sentences should be tagged with the metaphor tag to differentiate them from literal sentences like "His eyes glistened with tears."  \'Her eyes glinted with hatred.\' \'I saw a light in her eyes at the mention of cookies.\' '}, {'frame': 'Measure_linear_extent', 'tfidf': 1.1816235780715942, 'lexical_unit': 'block.n / yard.n / kilometer.n', 'definition': "This frame is concerned with nouns that denote Units of measurement for linear extent. The Frame Elements are Unit, Count,  and Stuff.'The shirt is made from 12 miles of pure cotton.''81 miles of dyke are still visible from this point.'"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 1.1565155982971191, 'lexical_unit': 'strong.a / weak.a / weakness.n', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

In the first one, movement or change caused by a social entity is conveyed as energy exerted by a physical entity. \'Social\' here encompasses entities that are economic, political, technological, historical, cultural, and intimate: \'The private sector is so much more dynamic.\' \'Singh had been under intense political pressure.\' \'Economies are still sluggish.\' Relatedly, the influential effect of an psychological entity is described in terms of energy exertion by a physical entity. \'Psychological\' includes the intellectual, emotional, and creative: \'Sinead\'s emotional intensity permeates every nuance of every lyric.\' \'He finds the Poet Laureate\'s theory about Shakespeare to be more energetic than persuasive.\' Both metaphors appear to involve a third metaphor, which is the anthropomorphization of processes (see examples directly above) or inhuman entities (e.g. in nature): \'The lazy creak of sails\' \'The energetic waves\' \'A broad, lethargic river\'  Further, there is a metonymy wherein energy exerted by people carrying out an activity characterizes instead a central object or other component of the activity: \'Lucker plays lazy games.\' \'She thought the lazy days in France would never end.\'  \'\' Compare to: Level_of_force_exertion.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.

A moment passed before the Girl in Brown added, "A mystical surge is initiating."
An assault fortress sat atop the highest peak of the Bleak Mountains.
The armed and armored edifice of titanium alloy overlooked the encamped army of zombies and polymorphs.
The tower atop the fortress flashed and sparked, manifesting a glowing, continuous bolt between it and the storm above.
The dragonfly-type bombers kept closing... until bolts lanced out from the skyward bolt and zapped into the swarm!
Aircraft erupted into flames and plummeted!
The swarm kept coming, its numbers struck and sent ablaze until none of it remained.
Not even one bomber reached the enemy basecamp.
Yississ cackled maniacally!
The demon cheered, "Well done, Brendaxa!
Your genius proves glorious!"
Brendaxa humbly corrected, "Milady, I was but one of many who devised your new weapon.
The secrets you share give us insights into possibilities."
The living Many of One were selfless, innovative and efficient.
I pleased Yississ greatly to see such qualities in her daughters born of them.
Adam and the Concubine generals were horrified.
The man asked the women, "What just happened?"
Drusilla answered, "We just lost a third of our heavy bombers."
A lieutenant general (Olga) surmised, "The enemy harnessed and channeled the electromagnetism of the Everlasting Storm."
Adam wondered, "What?"
The Concubine explained, "It seems they've converted a relay system into a mystical conduit."
"What?"
Drusilla spoke to her lieutenants, "A ground assault without air support would most likely fail."
The Virgin Soldiers in black cloaks nodded.
Drusilla and her lieutenants looked at Adam, as if awaiting his insight.
Drusilla reminded him, "You have oft bested us.
What do you suggest we do?"
The man warned, "This isn't going to be easy."
"Obviously.
Adam of Telluria, what do you suggest?"
"Well, don't bother with another airstrike until you find a way to take out that lightning weapon."
The women continued to stare.
The man continued, "The enemy has the forces and the terrain to shrug off a ground assault, so don't bother."
The clones were still staring.
"A small team may be the only thing that can get to that tower.
If we disable the tower then we need to attack with everything immediately."
A lieutenant general mentioned, "Your Army of Four is the perfect team for such a mission."
"Maybe."
Adam felt cold and sick.
His mind's eye could see Yississ grinning.
The man realized, "The enemy knows what we're planning.
Actually, I think they're counting on it.
They want the Army of Four to come right to them exactly where they want us.
Yississ is a damn spider!"
Adam thought and thought, concluding, "I need to talk to the Oracle."
Drusilla asked, "May I accompany you?"
"Are you scared of talking trees?"
Drusilla's analytical mind tried to make sense of the man's flippant question.
"No," she finally answered.
"Then let's go."
Conjure, Hairy and Flora watched from the edge of the forest as Adam led Drusilla down the steps of the Temple.
The plant fairy could hear her king telling the woman, "We're a rowdy bunch but we're friendly."
Drusilla mentioned, "Your carnivorous plant fairy sodomizes my sisters to devour them to bare bones."
"Hey, a carnivore's got to eat."
Flora grinned.
As Adam and Drusilla neared the woods, the man called, "Come on out and stop being so damn scary!"
Conjure and Hairy looked at each other, confused.
Flora told them, "Step out with me."
Drusilla felt so small and weak as the tall, menacing, carnivorous plant fairy and towering, monstrous, burly sasquatch stepped out before her.
The little half-goblin smiled and waved.
"My troops," Adam introduced.
"They're the best soldiers anywhere."
The cloaked and hooded Concubine bowed.
She introduced herself, "I am Drusilla Purple the Wise of the Fortieth Harvest and the commanding Priestess of the Telluria Expedition."
"Just call her Drusilla," Adam winked.
Flora told her king, "I have drawn the portal.
The Oracle waits."
"She knows I'm coming?"
"Adam, she is the Oracle."
"Oh, yeah."
Flora led everyone into the depths of the forest.
"Hello," Conjure greeted Drusilla.
"Hello."
"I am glad we are friends now."
The Concubine smiled.
The half-goblin prattled, "My friend Hairy is also glad.
We did not like you because you were invaders but Adam says you are not evil.
He tells us you are as human as he is."
"We are human," Drusilla confirmed.
"I know!
Now you are friends, right?"
The Virgin Soldier was at a loss as to how to answer.
Adam slapped Conjure on the head, rebuking, "Stop pestering the lovely general!
We're on official business, buddy boy."
"Official business?"
"Yeah.
We have a meeting with the talking tree."
"I know!"
Adam smiled at Drusilla, telling her, "He's smart."
Virgin Soldiers of the Great Seen Unseen were serious, professional and exact.
Yes, the Army of Four was supernatural, but how could such a band of bantering misfits best the Virgin Army?
Drusilla would use her time with these people to study them.
Perhaps if hostilities resumed with them, such intelligence could prove beneficial.
Flora led everyone to a spot where a circle filled with glyphs was drawn into the ground.
The plant fairy gestured for everyone to step onto the pattern.
Adam took Drusilla's hand.
He smiled, asking her, "Are you ready to take that big step in the right direction?"
"What?"
The man gently tugged on the woman's hand.
They stepped together onto the pattern... finding themselves stepping into a forest elsewhere in the world.
It was later in the day on this side of Telluria.
The trees were larger and more fruitful here than in Region One.
"Where are we?"
Drusilla wondered.
"About a third of the way around the world," Adam answered.
A gentle breeze washed over the group, whispering in a warm, soothing, maternal voice, "Soldiers of Telluria, await your king and our new friend.
Man and woman, please come to me.
Rest in my shade as I gaze into the answers you seek."
Adam led Drusilla onward.
Flora, Conjure and Hairy stayed behind.
The Virgin Soldier questioned, "Are you taking me to a secret location?"
"No." Adam brought Drusilla to a large tree shaped vaguely in the form of a voluptuous woman.
The man gestured at the imposing plant, introducing, "The Oracle of Telluria."
He looked up into the lush branches, introducing, "Drusilla of the Concubines wanted to meet you.
I hope you don't mind."
The branches rustled and a breeze swirled from above as the tree spoke, "My king, I am pleased she has come."
The "tree" told Drusilla, "Woman of the Great Seen Unseen, I shall never profane your master.
I shall never require you to dishonor him.
I shall honor your ways for they do not offend me.
My counsel shall never betray you."
Drusilla believed and trusted the voice.
She worried, "Am I being charmed?"
The Oracle knew, "You distrust that you trust me.
You are suspicious of your feelings towards Adam."
The cloaked and hooded Concubine bowed as if apologizing.
The Oracle assured, "The only enchantment upon you is within you: the whispered curse and blessing of the Shadow that fashioned you from a human mind and blood.
Your will is not your own but your thoughts and feelings are yours alone.
You sought Adam of your own yearning.
You heed my voice of your own accord."
Drusilla uttered the mantra, "I am not my own."
"You are not your own, woman formed from the very ground and water of your world.
Loyal servant of the Unheard Whisper, peace be with you."
Adam blurted, "We have a serious problem."
"My king, I am aware of the festering darkness.
Allow me to wander into its shadows that I may spy upon its doings."
"What?"
"My king, I must see and hear elsewhere.
Rest awhile, in the company of Drusilla Purple the Wise.
Await the return of my attention."
The man wondered, "How long do you want us to wait?"
but the Oracle did not respond.
"Hello?"
No response.
Adam huffed.
He told Drusilla, "You might as well make yourself comfortable because it's going to be awhile."
"How long?"
Adam shrugged, explaining, "Plant fairies don't have life-spans so they're never in a hurry."
He produced a flask and rations from his gear.
He handed them to Drusilla, telling her, "Bon appetite."
