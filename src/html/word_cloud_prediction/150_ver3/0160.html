            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

"Yes Mr Stuart.
He is here.
I'll send him in immediately."
The intercom clicked off.
A few seconds later the door opened and vision reappeared.
Again the captivating smile.
"Mr Stuart will see you now.
Please come this way".
The carpet made no noise as they walked down the hall.
Deep pile smothering their footsteps.
Vision opened the door, glanced into the room.
"Mr Walker to see you, ".
Andrew brushed rather ineffectually at some cigarette ash on his jacket, and went in.
As soon as he stepped inside, the door closed behind him.
The room was large and airy.
Shafts of sunlight streamed in through the windows, falling on the man who rose to greet him.
As he rounded the desk, Andrew caught a glimpse of Saville Row suit; shirt cuffs just the right length protruding, and a smile in full charm mode on an otherwise serious face.
When they shook hands, the hand was firm and dry.
Andrew felt his anxiety lessen.
Like himself, he felt that this was a man who would stand no messing.
The consultant ushered Andrew into the chair in front of the desk, asking whether he would like some refreshment, his glance indicating a well stocked mini bar discreetly hidden in an alcove off to one side.
Although his mouth was rather dry, he shook his head.
The consultant nodded approvingly then returned to his chair.
They regarded one another, and at length the consultant opened a file on the desk, steepled his fingers.
" I know that you are a computer expert, but I don't know how much you know of medicine.
I must assume that this may be rather limited, so I'll try to keep it simple.
I think the best way to deal with this is to show you some x-rays and take it from there.
".
"Hold it right there.
I'm not interested in the mechanics of the problem.
I have a feeling that you are trying to let me down gently.
Please tell me in simple language all I need to know.
That way we will not embarrass one another."
"All right, Mr Walker, I'll tell you what we have found with no frills.
You have a cancer.
The tests that you underwent show that it is in the lungs, and is advanced.
It is inoperable, and there are secondaries elsewhere.
They are not important, as they will not affect the outcome.
I am sorry if this is putting it somewhat bluntly, but that is what you asked me to do."
Andrew sat there for a while; eyes closed as he absorbed this.
The consultant sat and waited patiently, this was a scene that was all too familiar.
After a few moments in which Andrew digested this information, he raised his eyes and met those candid ones regarding him across the desk.
"Well, this is not really the shock I thought it would be.
I suppose during the last few days I have been preparing myself for this, and now it is here my main concern is not for me, but for my wife and son.
I would be more than obliged if you would give me the best prognosis you can."
He leaned back and waited.
"I have never met a person as cool as you before".
The consultant said.
"But what will happen is really in your hands.
By that I mean it depends on whether you are going to take things easy or work yourself into an earlier grave than is really necessary.
If you work at the same pressure that you have been recently, you will only have a matter of weeks, but if you take it easy and abide by the regime I will give you, it could postpone the event by several months.
The choice is yours.
"  Whilst Andrew was pondering this, the consultant buzzed the intercom and spoke quietly to the receptionist.
Shortly after, the door opened: she came in and put a sheaf of papers on the desk.
Her smile, as Andrew briefly caught her gaze was sympathetic, her thoughts, as she left the room were on the waste of such a strong looking man, and pity for the wife who would soon be left to fend for herself.
As she shut the door behind her, she mentally berated herself for even considering any emotion about a patient, and stalked angrily back to her desk.
It was not much later that he stepped out into Harley Street.
Driving away, the reality of the situation sinking in, he headed without thinking, towards home.
Turning into his cul-de-sac, the line of trees hiding the houses, he came to the detached house, with the trim garden, that was Susan's pride and joy.
He nosed the car up the short drive and stopped.
It was a deliberate act to switch the ignition off and apply the hand brake.
Reluctantly he went to the front door; inserted the key, and after taking a deep breath, opened it.
He could hear the radio playing an old big band number, and Susan singing along with it.
In the background the washing machine added a bass rumble.
"Hi Honey.
I'm home."
The sound of Susan singing stopped abruptly, and she appeared somewhat towsled, and threw herself into his waiting arms.
Her kiss had never lost the ability to thrill him, and even though he ached to prolong the moment, he reached up and removed her arms from around his neck.
She looked at him quizzically.
"What's wrong, darling.
You're not usually home this early, and you called me Honey.
You only call me that when you want to sweeten me, or there is something wrong.
Which is it?"
Silently he walked into the lounge and poured himself a large scotch, added a splash of water.
"Will you have one with me?"
"I think I'd better.
Perhaps I'm going to need it.
" Andrew poured hers, handed it to her, then sat down.
He took a sip of his drink, carefully put it down on an occasional table, turned towards her, then collapsed in tears.
He made no attempt to hide them.
Susan was so startled that she put her glass on the sideboard without looking, missed the edge, and as she moved to him, her glass fell to the floor, where it rolled, spilling the drink over the carpet.
She threw herself onto the arm of the chair, and as she put her arms about him, he turned to her, burying his face in her lap, and for a few moments she could only hold him until the crisis passed.
Siting up, he took a handkerchief from his pocket, dried his eyes, saying.
"That's enough of that."
As though to interrupt him, a car stopped outside, the door slammed and off key whistling sounded as footsteps clattered on the path.
The key turned, and their son Tony came in.  "Hi, I'm home" he said before he had absorbed the scene in front of him.
At twenty, he was an inch shorter than his father, well built, with strong features, and the wisp of a moustache gracing his upper lip.
The eyes usually so full of laughter, went suddenly serious.
"God, what's happened.
Why are you home, Dad.
Has the "OB" finally gone too far?"
"I'm glad you came home now."
Andrew said.
" At least what I have to say need only be said once."
Tony picked up the spilled glass, set it on the table, then subsided into an armchair.
"Fire ahead, Dad, what the hell has happened?"
Chapter 2  Sir Archibald Hemmings known affectionately, despisedly, or hatedly, depending on who was doing the considering, as 'OB', or The 'Old Bastard' was seated in his top floor office.
The view from the French window was impressive.
From the open balcony it overlooked the nearer buildings, and the gleam of water could be seen amongst the trees at the edge of the golf course that was his favourite recreational place.
The fact that he was the Head of the Ministry of Science and Technology had opened many doors to him, and his inherited title had opened many more.
A tall sallow being, with a pronounced stoop, and a way of walking silently about on thick-soled shoes had earned him his nickname.
He was aware of this, and even from childhood he had always been able to ferret out secrets that other people had thought secure.
He owed much of the status he now enjoyed to this ability.
Over the years he had used one opportunity of blackmail after another to gain further hold over his victims.
Surprising snippets of information often came his way, and he had recently learned by devious ways of Charles' involvement with Industrial Espionage.
Seated at his desk he looked at Charles, regarding him much as a cat would regard a mouse it was about to torment.
Charles squirmed under the cold gaze.
What, he wondered, could the Old Bastard want with him.
He was not left in doubt for long.
'OB' gazed at him and with a slight smile mentioned one name.
Charles started.
"Who"  "You heard me.
You thought you'd covered your tracks pretty well, but you were wrong.
Did you think was unaware of your nasty little deals.
Yes, I know all about your involvement with the Americans".
The 'OB's smile widened slightly as he saw Charles' discomfiture.
The pleasant smile was replaced by an ugly snarl.
"Yes.
I know all about your little sideline.
Now, however I think the spoils will be divided in two, and you will do me certain favours as and when I ask.
Do I make myself clear?"
Charles merely nodded his mouth too dry to reply.
"Naturally, as head of the computer section, I am aware of Andrew Walkers work, and I also received, as a matter of course, the doctors report on his physical state.
Andrew Walker is dying.
He has advanced cancer.
I want you to keep a very close eye on him.
As you know, all his research is Government property, but I don't trust him.
You will report to me if you find out anything that I should know about.
"  Defensively Charles retorted "You know full well the inter-departmental secrecy rule.
"Charles.
I only want you to watch him for now.
But remember that we are a partnership, and it would not be in my interest to cross you.
In fact I wouldn't do that.
Now go back to your work, and call me when you have something interesting."
The satisfied smile was back.
He nodded briefly, then picked up some papers, turning his chair away to show that the interview was over.
Charles got awkwardly to his feet, turned and left the office.
In his anger he did not see the startled glance of the secretary sitting nearby.
It was in the coffee break when she met her friends in the canteen that she told them, wide eyed, about the state Charles had been in when leaving the office.
She had been interested to find out whether Charles' rumoured sexual reputation was true.
At times she had daydreamed during idle moments, on how it would feel to have his hands doing wonderful things to her naked body.
Maybe, if she played her cards right, one day she might find out, but the time was certainly not yet right.
Wistfully she abandoned the dream as the intercom clattered and the OB's' hated voice rasped a demand for her to bring her note book  Another of her dreams was to see him come to a violent end, the more violent the better.
How little she knew how near that event was.
Chapter 3 Susan took Andrew's hand and pulled him over to the settee.
"Darling, we have never had any secrets, so what's the matter".
Andrew glanced from her to Tony and back.
"What I have to say can really only be said one way, because no matter which way you look at it, the result is the same.
God knows I wouldn't hurt either of you, but now I must.
I was sent to the company doctor to sort out my cough.
