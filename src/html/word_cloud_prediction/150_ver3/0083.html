            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

Blankerton, as my article also explains, African-Americans are three times less likely to comply with police orders than people of other races.
This leads to altercations.
And this is another verifiable fact that might make African-Americans feel less victimized and more in control of their own destiny."
"Institutions ... systemic ...
Hey ...
Hey ho, Hey ho, racist cops have got to go!
Hey ho, racist cops have got to go!"
she began chanting.
"Ms.
Blankerton?"
She only continued chanting.
"Shouldn't these facts be shown in our newspaper?
Can you respond to me?"
She sat there, mindlessly repeating the same words.
Mike became unsettled.
Was she losing her mind?
He got up and backed out of her office as she stared at him chanting.
He cleaned out his desk with shaking hands.
He copied all his notes from his work computer onto a USB.
He had several long-term projects that he knew United Media would never publish because they'd find them far too controversial, too damning, but he was compelled to work on them anyway.
Conspiracy theories like the negative psychological effects of augmented satellite tv signals on the populous, or social engineering experiments being conducted through the coordinated efforts of global elite that any non-discerning twenty-first century human would scoff at.
Deleted.
Recycle bin emptied.
At the bottom of his drawer was a heavy, hardcover edition of the novel, 1984.
It was filled with notes he had written in the margins about the dangers of propaganda.
He always felt that a certain power came from that book.
He dropped it in the box with his other stuff and walked out to his car.
Traffic became worse than usual as he neared the university.
His heartrate was still up.
He needed to get home and pound the speed bag.
He had a lot of decisions he needed to make. Ms. Blankerton had always been a bit of a loon, but she had never lost her ability to have a discussion.
The country had been getting more and more polarized for some time and there were clear lines of what kinds of people were on what side.
People working at mainstream media companies were clearly on the left, and leftists were having a harder and harder time holding conversations with people who disagreed with them.
But still, he had never seen anyone in the workplace break down into chanting rather than conversing.
He wished so badly he could have slapped her.
He wanted to snap her out of it.
Some horns beeped up ahead.
He heard screams.
The cars ahead of him started doing u-turns and speeding back from where they came.
A bunch of what looked like university students were marching down the street towards him.
They had their arms locked and they covered the entire width of the road.
There appeared to be several rows of them.
It seemed that they were mostly Black students.
"Blacks aren't safe in a White Supremacist Country!
Blacks aren't safe in a White Supremacist Country!"
they shouted.
Some of them carried signs, "End the racial wage gap" and "Stop the open season on black men."
The car in front of him was too close, so Mike couldn't pull forward and do a u-turn.
He couldn't back up because there were cars behind him.
The protestor's shouting had a strange monotony to it.
They stopped marching right in front of the cars effectively blocking all six lanes of traffic.
A couple people got out of their cars on either side of Mike.
A White guy in a tie, and a truck driver who had stepped out of his rig.
They each started talking to the protestors, but Mike couldn't hear what they were saying.
Mike stepped out of his car too.
He took a few steps toward the protesters.
They had these blank expressions, these dead looks in their eyes.
They looked the way Ms. Blankerton did this afternoon.
"Blacks aren't safe in a White supremacist country!"
They continued shouting.
Mike figured he would try pandering.
"Look, guys, I know you face all kinds of oppression.
I know the system is rigged against you and that you're angry.
As a person of color, I know what oppression feels like.
I just want to get through.
I'm on my way home.
Why don't you just make a space for me to get through.
I'll be on my way and you can keep up the fight."
They kept mindlessly chanting.
No change in facial expression, no acknowledgement that they even heard him.
Mike couldn't even tell what they were looking at.
Their eyes seemed to be unfocused.
A scream came from Mike's right.
A protestor was biting the hand of the White guy who'd gotten out of his car just before Mike.
The protestor jerked his head back and with it came the guy's finger.
The man held his four-fingered hand up in disbelief and screamed.
Blood spurted up in pulses.
The attacker lunged forward and tackled the man to the ground.
He bit at his neck.
Two other students darted toward the White man and began biting at various limbs.
The chant "Blacks aren't safe in a White supremacist country" continued.
Other students ran toward cars and began banging on car windows.
Some of them leaped on hoods and car roofs.
They jumped up and down and kept up the chant.
People were being dragged out of cars.
The students stepped closer to Mike.
Mike put his hands out in front of him and started backing up.
They stared at him with their empty eyes and repeated so eerily, "Blacks are not safe in a White supremacist country."
"I'm not White!
I am not even White!"
He carefully opened his car door and slipped inside.
He locked his doors.
There were still cars on all sides of him and he had nowhere to go.
He looked frantically for something he could use as a weapon.
He shuffled through the box of his belongings from work.
Nothing even remotely resembled a weapon except the heavy, hardcover edition of '1984'.
He picked it out of the box and held it with clenched fists as the protesters approached.
They kept staring straight ahead and walked right by Mike's car.
Horns continued to blare and Mike heard the sounds of cars crashing as people desperately tried escaping the traffic jam.
Screams filled the air as more and more people were pulled from their cars.
Most of the victims tried fighting back but to no avail.
Any punch they landed didn't even slow down the attackers.
Mike heard a scream from the car behind him.
It was a young woman and she was being pulled out of her broken window by her hair.
Mike jumped out of the car and charged the protestor holding the woman.
The protestor wore a shirt that read, "I have a dream ..."
He held the woman's hair in one hand and her upper arm in the other.
He tilted his head back and opened his mouth.
Mike swung the book around and hit the SJW in the jaw.
Several of his teeth flew out of his head.
He dropped the girl and roared.
A silvery goo dripped from his mouth where his teeth had been.
He looked at Mike.
The tendons of his neck stood out.
"Blacks are incarcerated at a rate five times higher than Whites!"
he shouted in garbled words.
"Blacks commit violent crimes at higher rates than other races!"
Mike shot back.
The SJW pointed his finger at Mike and shouted incredulously, "That's racist!"
as blood dripped from his knuckles from a previous victim.
"That's according to the FBI!"
Mike swung the book again and struck the bridge of the protester's nose with a crunch.
Blood instantly flooded from it.
He brought his hand to his nose and growled angrily.
"Blacks are ten times more likely to be harassed by police, than Whites!"
Mike brought '1984' around again and this time hit him just above the ear.
The book went clean through the man's head.
Skull fragments and an orange goo exploded into the air and landed on the faces of some of the other rioters.
The headless body fell to the ground.
Mike looked down at the book.
It had orange goo streaked across it.
Black smoke poured up behind him from two cars that had crashed.
Car alarms went off.
More people screamed.
News helicopters circled high above them.
A surge of adrenaline shot through Mike's body and he jumped toward a group of students banging on the cracked car window of an old lady.
He swung the book like a club and hit another protestor just above the ear.
There was a spectacular crunch of breaking bone as the skull shattered into pieces.
The orange goo shot out like water from a quick burst of a fire hydrant.
The body fell to the ground.
Another protestor stopped banging on the window and turn to Mike, "The average White commits five microaggressions every-" His skull got bashed into oblivion.
Mike wiped orange goo from his face.
He jumped and leaped and swung his weapon powerfully like a Spartan warrior.
He moved with the grace of a ballet dancer, but with the power of an Asian tiger.
Orange goo splashed and sprayed into the air like the fireworks of a fourth of July finale.
Car horns and screams provided a cacophonic background music.
The steady beat of the chopper blades provided the rhythm.
Cars farther back started revving their engines and some lurched forward desperate to escape the melee.
The car that had been blocking him in had managed to escape by plowing through the crowd.
Mike wiped goo from his forehead.
