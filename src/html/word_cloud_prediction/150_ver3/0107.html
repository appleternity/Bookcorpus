Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable. '}];

"You must proceed ahead on your own.
If you do not return in five minutes you will fail."
"What's waiting for me?"
Ethan asked with genuine concern.
"You will have to figure that out yourself."
Ethan's throat bobbled as he gulped his cold anger down and Blake stared, unmoving.
When Ethan looked down the pitch black trail and back, Blake merely tapped the top of his wrist with a claw where a silver watch was clasped.
The gesture was clear.
Time was wasting.
Five minutes wasn't long and Ethan spun and continued alone, his hand being the only guide.
Two agonizing minutes later Ethan barely suppressed a yelp of surprise as three silhouettes extracted from the inky blackness in the form of a club-wielding male Ogre, a feminine Centaur with a pair of six foot long claymores lazily gripped in her demure hands and a Nymph with a longbow in her hand and a quiver full of arrows behind her right shoulder.
The Ogre wore long blue jeans only while the Centaur mare wore a red t-shirt with a plunging neckline to expose an ample bosom and the Nymph, like most others wore a skillfully carved wooden bra held together by vine and for bottoms wore a handmade thong bikini out of vines too.
Despite the chilly weather, these three beings weren't human and felt cold in the same way, especially the creamy skinned Nymphs who would wade in snow and still not find the need to cover up.
The claymore wielding Centaur woman, despite standing over nine feet tall, had a sweet and delicate voice.
Her dull golden horseshoes were clearly done by Celestia, Ethan could now spot what was her work from all others.
"You come unharmed, Fire-thrower...
Good.
I am Ellen Quiethoof.
This here is Magnus Eldertree and his mate Nell Eldertree."
"I know you two!"
Ethan pointed to the Ogre and Nymph.
"Back when that Elf was found.
He took your daughter."
"And we are forever grateful."
Nell said.
"Do you know why you were summoned at this time?"
Ellen the Centaur asked.
"No, but I'm guessing it's a fight.
Your kind wouldn't have unsheathed your sword for any other reason."
Ethan guessed, not that it was all that difficult.
"Very astute."
Ellen stood tall.
"Blademaster Blake was once our master long ago and it is prudent you show your skill.
He believes you are ready and now you must prove it.
We know your powers can smite us, but you are not allowed to depend on them."
Ellen gripped her swords to level them down at him.
"Defeat us before your time expires.
How long did he give you?"
"I got less than two minutes and I don't want to be late."
The three looked to each other unsurely at the short time he gave.
"How far must I go."
"Make us submit.
Nothing more.
HA!"
Ellen charged the short distance, swinging her heavy swords as if they weighed nothing.
Ethan told his flames to not hurt them, but to stay on so he could see.
His focus locked onto surviving the moment and remembering how best to knock a powerful Centaur down.
Not only did they weigh more than a ton, they were faster than actual horses.
He leapt back as he brought his fists up, his peripheral vision watching the swords slicing through the space his body occupied a moment ago.
As they moved away he sidestepped in and ducked as Ellen's strength was near that of an Amazon and she had flipped her swords around to lunge for his chest, one edge got close enough to sheer off a few hairs from his head.
Ethan gambled as he targeted Ellen's front hooves, where most of her weight resided and had to avoid getting kicked.
The mare realized where he was aiming, but could not bring her swords down in time so she bent down fractionally and hopped sideways just as his hands shot out and caught air.
Ellen moved around like a lightning strike and Ethan barely had time to roll to the side as her hind legs were attempting a single mule kick, but missed.
Ethan sprang up as she was turning and bringing her swords around, but as she was doing so he lunged and leapt.
He slapped a bear hug around her torso, his face unfortunately nestled between her large breasts.
She smelled like vanilla.
Ellen was momentarily surprised by the intimate tactic till she grunted in pain as Ethan speared his knees into her pearly white equestrian chest several times with all the force he could muster.
Ellen lost the air in her massive lungs for that was basically where her sternum was, for in her upper human body she had no lungs or stomach.
He aimed for her weakness with determination.
Air shot past Ellen's full ruby red lips as her forelegs buckled.
Ethan landed lightly on his feet and backed away as she lost the grip on her swords and threw her hands out to catch herself before flying face first into the grass they battled into.
Grounded, Magnus lifted his Celestia crafted club that was larger than any baseball bat and was artfully created to look as if it were made from actual wood for it had tree rings, knots and groves a wooden club might have.
Magnus stood at just over six feet, but had a wider back and longer arms than Ethan and adding the extra three and a half feet of a heavy club was difficult to dodge.
Ogres were much like humans, only twice as strong and you would never want to head butt them for obvious reasons.
Ethan jumped back, feeling the wind from the club on his cheek and delivered two quick jabs to Magnus's jaw and felt like hitting concrete.
The club began to glow as the Ogre spoke a series of commands which activated hidden runes and fed off his Spirit Energy.
It had a blue glow and began to shoot sparks.
Ethan had been with Kanade long enough to realize the tiny sparks made the club into an effective stunning weapon and would act much like a taser and one touch would render him incapacitated.
She could make the runes, but couldn't use them herself, but right now Magnus was.
Blue sparks of Spirit Energy sizzled past Ethan's head before his burning fists punched the Ogre thrice in the swinging shoulder.
Magnus cried out as the localized jabs increased damage and the heavy club's weight became too much and fell.
Ethan kicked out, landing the heel of his boot in the Ogre's chest to send him flying back.
Two down.
Ethan spun around to find Nell aiming an arrow at his leg.
She shouted "Stop the arrow!"
and loosed.
Fear of pain made it happen again.
'Boom!' there exploded a sound that lit the area for a flash and the arrow was incinerated automatically, Without Ethan needing to think.
Not only did the arrow get vaporized, Nell was thrown back by the immense force that came from the Fire Elemental and her trusty longbow disintegrated as well.
Ellen stared, slack jawed at the power he released, but could not stand.
Magnus yelled "Nell!"
when he saw her knocked through the air and into the darkness.
He tried to stand, but was unable to even manage rolling over.
"I'm fine."
She groaned sorely as she didn't return alone.
Blake carried the Nymph in his arms saying.
"Ethan, you had ten seconds remaining.
You bested my three best pupils I ever trained."
He then looked down.
"Nell, can you stand?"
"I believe so."
She patted the Naga's clothed chest as he sat her lightly down on her bare feet and she checked herself over to sigh when she wasn't on fire or even singed.
Ethan collapsed to his knees and gasped as Nell tended her soul mate, helping him sit up.
"How did he do?"
Blake wondered.
"I came when Nell was thrown through the air and caught her before she made contact with the ground.
That burst of light helped me see her being thrown."
"He is surprisingly fierce for a human."
Ellen said as she forced herself to stand.
"Blake, I wondered why you gave him so short a time, but now I understand."
She then moved over to collect her swords, checked them and slid them into the sheaths that are strapped lengthwise to her lower half.
"What am I missing?"
Ethan said as he increased the brightness of the fire in his right hand and killed the one in his left.
Nell said as Magnus stood and used her for support "Blake forces his students to fight for their final lesson.
He taught all three of us, but you had the shortest time limitation I ever heard of..."
"No, Jason of the Argonauts had the shortest time.
I gave him three minutes to face two of my sons and he succeeded... barely."
Blake corrected her and looked at Ethan.
"But in the four months you have been my student Ethan, you have inhuman focus and a knack at learning, so long as you don't assume.
You need to learn patience, but that will come with experience.
I gave you a time limit" Ellen, Nell and Magnus moved to stand behind their former Naga master to look at him as well. "because you excel under pressure.
Nell is one of the best archers, Magnus' skill with his club and activating different magics in the heat of combat exceeds mine and Ellen's swordsmanship, speed and archery talents are in the top fifty in all Centaur herds in the universe.
You defeated three veteran warriors in under five minutes which means you are now a warrior in full and can hold your own against demons, even without your powers.
You have passed."
"I need a new bow, Blake."
Nell pouted.
"It will be replaced y me, but now Ethan, I must mark you as a student of mine who is graduated from my tutelage and is a trained warrior."
The Naga gestured him forward with a claw.
"Uh..."
He hesitated.
"Come closer.
Magnus, please bring the kit."
Blake said and the Ogre grabbed his club, spoke under his breath and turned it into a bright blue-white light that pushed the darkness further than Ethan's hand and walked down the trail.
By the time he returned Ethan was standing before the three anxiously.
Magnus handed over an old leather bag that looked like a letter carrier's satchel.
Blake lifted the flap and removed a jar of thick black ink inscribed with runes in a ceramic jar along with cloth, Tournikka ointment and a strange, stamp-like object with a long handle.
"Ethan, would you mind sterilizing this for me."
The Elemental took the object and covered it in the fire of his hand, seeing that there were hundreds upon hundreds of needles less than a quarter inch long in the pattern of a Naga's clawed hand surrounded by a slit eye with a pair of crossed swords in the background, with the pommel's facing from the bottom up.
Immediately Ethan realized what he held and said "A Tattoo.
You want to stamp a tattoo on me?"
"Well you're immune to heat so branding is out of the question."
Blake said sarcastically.
"Yes, this is my standard all my students wear.
The needles are so fine you will feel almost nothing but a bit of pressure.
It will be quicker and more identical than any tattoo artist could ever replicate" Ethan switched hands so the metal stamp could cool.
"Show him."
Magnus, Nell and Ellen pulled their long hair aside, Magnus' being silvery, Nell's being bright evergreen and Ellen's dirty blonde.
At the nape off all three of their necks was Blake's black mark.
It wasn't more than two inches long, and was easily able to hide.
The object cooled and was returned to the Naga who opened the rune marked, ink jar and sat the needles end into the thick black ink and thoroughly moved it around so every microscopic needle was coated.
Blake stood and had Ethan turn around.
Warm, scaly fingers lifted the thick hairs on the back of Ethan's head and before he could say 'Wait!' there was a firm pressure on the back of his neck.
Blake began whispering to it and Ethan could feel movement, like ants, but there was no pain.
Blake was whispering to the creation so the needles would fill every piece of skin that wasn't pierced.
It was all over in a minute tops and the pressure on his neck was lifted.
Ethan was told to hold still and soon felt a wet cloth wiping away excess ink and a few tiny drops of blood before drying and applying a generous amount of ointment.
"Done.
Here, see for yourself."
Ethan tuned and took the pair of small hand mirrors.
He maneuvered them so he could see just the bottom of the tattoo because his hair wasn't long enough to cover it all.
