Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Connecting_architecture', 'tfidf': 1.757204294204712, 'lexical_unit': 'escalator.n / stairs.n / staircase.n', 'definition': "An entity is integrated into a building as a Part of a (possibly unexpressed) Whole which may refer to the whole building or merely to a sub-part of the building.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Shaped_part', 'tfidf': 1.423886775970459, 'lexical_unit': 'rind.n / mouth.n / leg.n', 'definition': "An entity is a shaped Part of a larger Whole.

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Aesthetics', 'tfidf': 0.5771939815177578, 'lexical_unit': 'fair.a / hideous.a / beautiful.a', 'definition': "An Entity is judged to be sensually pleasing or intellectually interesting to a (generally implicit) Judge.

Chapter 5 Beautiful Stranger That Thursday was the longest day of my life.
Every single class seemed to last three hours, and even lunch with Lindy went painfully slow.
I barely tasted what I ate, though I did force myself to drink plenty of water.
I rushed back home and, before anyone else arrived, I claimed the bathroom for myself.
Just as I turned the blow dryer off, I heard the radio playing.
I stuck my head out of the door and saw Kathy and her boyfriend, or rather, her soon-to-be fiance, Will.
They sat close together on the sofa looking through a magazine, their heads almost touching.
I closed the door at once with a silent turn of the knob, in hopes they wouldn't notice me.
I applied my makeup using the most precision ever, making sure the black pencil lined my eyes straight and even, each eyelash sculpted into a perfect curve - long and thick, and finally, my lips carefully painted with the red lipstick, usually reserved for special nights out.
Next, to dress the rest of me: a bright shiny silver chain around my neck that matched my hoop earrings, and my favorite silver bracelet.
I pulled on my white cashmere sweater with a scoop neck line and a pair of brand new jeans.
I gave myself a once over in the mirror, loving how the sweater accentuated my hair; the effect of black on white - so dramatic.
By the time I left the bathroom, Kathy and Will had moved over to her bed.
They lounged on top of the covers, fully dressed, whispering quietly.
I tried to tiptoe out before they heard me, but the creaking floors gave me away.
Kathy turned at the noise, leapt up and bounced toward me extending her left hand.
Her excited giggle came out more like a squeal and she said, "Look, Lizzy!
I'm engaged!"
I took her hand and examined the ring.
After all the boasting and bragging, it made me happy to see that her man had finally come through with a ring.
"Wow!
It's beautiful.
Congratulations, guys!
Have you picked a date yet?"
I asked turning toward Will when I heard the bed squeak.
He planted his feet flat on the floor as he sat up on the side of the bed, rubbing his eyes.
"We're going to wait till Will graduates and he lands a job.
So, one year from next June - isn't that cool?
I am so excited!
I can't wait to go home and show my parents.
Will decided to give me the ring before my birthday, and we're driving over to see my folks this weekend.
It'll be the first time he meets them."
Kathy's excitement waned as she added in a much lower tone: "I hope they love him as much as I do."
When she glanced over at him, her eyes twinkled and she gave him a warm smile.
Will looked at the two of us huddled together by the closet door, raised an eyebrow, and said with a twinge of dread, "Yep, me too."
He was a man of few words.
In order to spend the rest of his life with Kathy, he'd have to stay that way.
Kathy, now moved by his concern, rushed back to the bed and sat beside him, lost in her own world, allowing me to finally make a break for it.
Although I didn't want any more long, drawn out conversation, I lingered for a moment in the open doorway, just watching the lovebirds.
She took his hand in hers and whispered words of encouragement.
He smiled.
Then they kissed.
It was a sweet scene, but I had far more pressing things to consider.
I closed the door behind me, quiet as a whisper, escaping without another thought of roommates and fiances.
I had only one thing on my mind as I left the building.
I practically skipped over to the pub, barely noticing the chill in the air.
It was earlier than when we had arrived the previous night.
The sky held huge gray clouds that glowed orange where the setting sun sat low in the sky.
My heart raced, though not out of fear or anxiety.
This time it was out of hopefulness.
I would simply die if he wasn't there.
I opened the door and was immediately blasted by loud music and the smell of fried foods - pizza and onions - all at once.
I stepped inside to laughter, clinking of glasses and silverware, and instant warmth.
As the door shut behind me, I glanced around, unbuttoned my coat, and fluffed out my hair, untangling it from the wind.
A few couples were already out on the dance floor, oblivious to me.
A man with curly brown hair sat at the bar, his head cranked in my direction, doing his best to get eye contact, but I refused and looked away.
I took my time, weaving through the tables toward the booth where he had sat the night before: it was empty.
I removed my coat and sat down exactly where he had been sitting when I first spotted him.
My thoughts lingered on that moment, centering on his long, black hair.
Not too unlike my own, I mused, smiling.
I had no idea if he would even be here again, but I had to find out who he was, why I felt so drawn to him - this stunning stranger.
This was so new and foreign to me, to be venturing out to a bar all alone, deliberately looking for someone - and with such determination.
But I was driven like never before: as though the winds of change had taken me by force and compelled me like a violent storm.
It was his eyes.
They had never really let me go; I was still haunted by those eyes - so dark, so penetratingly beautiful.
Even though we had not exchanged one word between us, I had to come back.
As I waited for the server to take my order, I checked my face in my pocket mirror:  eye makeup good, lipstick straight, nothing in my teeth.
I smoothed out my hair again and slid to the back of the booth for a better view of the whole room and the main entryway.
A minute or two later the door opened, letting in the sounds of the street just as a motorcycle roared by.
A young couple walked in hand-in-hand.
I let out the breath I had been holding.
Not him.
When the waiter came I ordered a salad and a glass of iced tea.
I wasn't the least bit hungry.
I was far too nervous and excited to think of food.
The door swung open again, and two loud, obnoxious guys came in: one with short, dark hair; the other blonde.
Their whooping and hollering was enough to set my teeth on edge.
As if that wasn't bad enough, when they spotted me, one elbowed the other as they sauntered toward the bar and made annoying wolf noises.
What jerks!
Thankfully, my server came and blocked their view of me.
I picked at my salad for about ten minutes.
I didn't want to have green things in my teeth when I smiled, so I basically pushed things around with my fork, ate a few croutons, and sipped my tea.
A dismal heaviness crept over me when the streetlights came on - still no sign of him.
I began to wish I had just stayed home and finished my school work.
The two loud men looked my way and the blonde one stood up as though he planned to come toward my table.
I snatched up my purse and headed in the opposite direction to the ladies' room, my hair swishing behind me.
I spent more time than necessary in there in the hopes that Blondie would take the hint and leave me alone.
Finally, I sneaked back to my table, but kept my eyes on the floor.
I didn't want to give those guys the wrong impression by any stray eye contact.
Edging my way back, I inhaled a remarkable fragrance that I hadn't noticed earlier - a cross between something sweet and musky with a hint of spicy smoke.
Someone must have just blown out a candle or two.
I sat back down, adjusting myself as I slid in, and risked a quick glance toward the bar for my potential stalkers: they were on the other side of the dance floor, shooting pool.
Success!
I picked up my fork and attempted to stab a tomato - which promptly flew up into the air, bounced once on the table and then took flight out onto the floor!
I felt my face burn as red as my flying tomato.
Flaming hell - how embarrassing!
I was glad the lights were dim, and nothing but faint candle flame flickered through the room casting irregular shadows at each table.
I glanced around furtively to see if anyone had noticed my acrobatic food display - and there - right at the booth next to mine, facing straight toward me, looking deep into my eyes, sat the man with the long black hair and unfathomable eyes.
My heart pounded hard and wild within my chest, taking my breath away.
My memory eluded me, my mind now completely blank.
I blinked, trying to catch my breath and gather my thoughts together, feeling dazed and quite stupid.
What the hell had I planned to do once I found him?
The corners of his mouth turned up a little.
Smile!
I had planned to smile!
And so I did.
He returned the smile more fully, and our eyes locked.
I wanted to look around so I could get a full view of him, but it hardly mattered any more.
He was here!
And I could behold those wonderful, dark eyes again, though it felt more like he was beholding me; they bore into me so deeply.
I wondered how long we would keep this up: smiling and staring.
I blinked again, picked up my glass, and took a sip of tea.
For one second, I glanced away as I reached for my napkin.
When I looked back he had moved and now stood right beside my table.
Not wanting to miss a thing, I took my time studying him, directing my view upwards - slow and easy.
He wore black pants and a black shirt, and when he removed his dark, blood-red scarf, I noticed a silver chain with some sort of medallion.
There was a tattoo on the side of his neck, but from where I sat, I couldn't tell what it was.
His ebony hair fell down past his shoulders, straight and silky.
He had a strong, square chin with a smoky 5 o'clock shadow coming down along his jaw-line and surrounding his smooth, hard-candy lips; his nose was straight and narrow like a Greek sculpture, and his eyes - my God, his eyes!
They were so dark now that they were purple.
Once again he peered far into me, holding me firmly in place, captivating me by his determination, fascinating me with his stunning, good looks.
The way he gazed at me with purpose and intent told me there wasn't a thing I could hide from him - ever.
I cleared my throat, trying to find my voice.
"Please, sit down."
Did I just say that out loud?
I must have: he nodded and eased himself in across from me.
I was able to see his eyes straight on now.
It was nearly impossible to speak, to breathe, or to look away.
I supposed we could spend the whole evening staring; I could live with that.
Raising an eyebrow, I pushed my hair back behind my shoulder, wondering if he would ever speak.
"Your hair is lovely," he said, as if he had read my mind.
His voice was velvety-deep, strong and sincere.
"Your hair is..."
I groped for the correct word.
What should I say?
Lovely in a handsome way?
It was the length that made it so arresting, so beautiful.
"Long," he said, finishing my sentence for me.
"Right, but that's not what I meant.
What I mean is, I don't think you should ever cut it... it becomes you.
It belongs where it is, not on some barber's floor."
My mouth had gotten ahead of my brain.
I wasn't trying to be funny and hoped I wasn't blabbering like an idiot.
"No worries," he said with a brief smile.
It was then that I noticed his British accent and asked, "Are you from England?"
"Yes.
I am here on holiday."
His voice was as alluring as his eyes and his hair.
How insane is this?
My mind reeled.
