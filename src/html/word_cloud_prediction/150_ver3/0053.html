The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

No, I'm not.
That's very strange to me, what you just said."
Cap whined like a child whose toy had been taken.
"So what am I supposed to do?
I got nothin!"
"Captain, you're starting on Monday.
Once you complete the mission, your pay will be restored.
Your first check should be in your account in about a week."
"A week?
Damn it Jones!
I got a date tonight."
"Well, perhaps you should consider doing something inexpensive.
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
And Captain; remember...Monday 8am."
It took some doing, but Cap managed to convince his date to alter their plans for the night.
At first, he had started to panic, but there was nothing else he could do on such short notice.
Luckily, she seemed to be open-minded and as far as he could tell, it didn't appear to scare her off.
It was around 8 o'clock at night when Cap pulled into the parking lot of the 24/7 Taco Bell.
He parked at the end in the farthest spot away from the building in front of the path that led to the drive-thru.
The only other car in the back row-two empty spaces between them-a silver Nissan Altima.
Cap got out and put his coat on as he looked around.
A burly, dim witted looking man in a minivan stared at him as rolled by in the drive-thru lane.
'This is fucking embarrassing' Cap thought.
He looked at his phone as the dim light glowed up at his face.
He considered cancelling, until the door of the Nissan opened and he saw his date walking around the back of the car.
"Hey" she said walking towards him.
"Hey" he replied, taking four seconds longer to say it, even though it was the exact same word, with the same amount of letters.
He stood there frozen.
"Julius, right?"
He mumbled under his breath, "It's Captain Carbon."
"What?"
"Uh, nothing.
You're Ashley?"
"I am."
Her coal black heels clicked against the pavement as she came over and joined him at the back of the Tesla.
If he hadn't physically seen her get out of the car, he'd have put money on her riding a motorcycle.
Her baby blue eyes stood out amongst her young face, which while sharp, had full cheeks like two cherry tomatoes plumped beneath her eyes.
The minimal amount of make-up she had looked professionally done, and her jet black curly hair crunched in place to the middle of her neck.
Strangely, she had the type of face that was hard to imagine without a smile, even when she had a solemn look on it.
Tight black jeans with a low-cut grey t-shirt and a small leather jacket.
She looked like she was carved out of obsidian by a former gang member who had risen to become a world famous sculptor-a sculptor, who had turned his life around, filling the void in his life with art, but remnants of past violent tendencies forever stained his soul.
So yea, she was pretty fucking sexy.
With one hand tucked in her pocket, she blew a bubble with her pink gum and purposefully popped it-as if to say: 'I'm in charge, even with something as minute as bubble gum.
It pops, only when I decide and allow it to fucking pop.'
Having not yet taken her eyes off of him, she speared Cap with a devilish smile, and looked like she either wanted to kick his ass, or jump on him, wrap her legs around his waist and make-out.
Cap was conflicted on whether he should prepare to be stabbed and have his wallet stolen, or rent a hotel room for the sole purpose of avoiding damage to his own bedroom from the animistic sex.
"Hey, sorry again about the uh..."
he waived his hand towards the building.
"It's ok" she said politely.
She had a sweet voice.
It didn't fit her.
"I love Taco Bell."
"Right?
It's great."
Cap, still trying to shake his embarrassment, felt slightly better by her genuine acceptance for Taco Bell.
Met by a bothersome line when they first walked in, by the time they got their food and sat down, there were only two other people inside.
They sat at the opposite end against the window with a perfect view of their cars.
"So, I thought you were like some health nut?
You're ok with eating this stuff?"
Zero timidity in her voice, every question she asked demanded an answer.
Though her words were lightly coated in a friendly and bubbly glaze, Cap wasn't sure whether he was on a date, or in audience of a commanding officer.
He quickly became addicted to the sound of her voice.
"I protect the environment.
To do that, I need food."
He glanced up from his tray at her innocent face.
'That's the only thing that's innocent about her' he thought.
"Well yea, duh.
But I mean, you aren't a vegan or a vegetarian or anything?
I know a lot of environmentalists that are in to all that."
He glanced at her then down at his tray.
"I know you're all about the environment, more than anyone I've ever seen, I'm just curious.
Like Taco Bell.
Is Taco Bell good or bad for the environment?
And if they're bad, you probably wouldn't eat here right?"
Cap took a bite of his taco and just looked at her.
"Let me ask you this" she said.
"You obviously eat meat.
Is that like, allowed?"
Cap swallowed, tipped the paper cup of his drink without a lid and took a big sip, still staring at her.
She took a bite of her quesadilla and looked at him.
"Well!?"
He took a deep breath and leaned forward.
"Ashley, do you know how old the earth is?"
She took another bite.
"It's about 4.5 billion years old."
"Ok..."
"A long time, yes?
Throughout that time, there have been all kinds of things crawling around.
Some went extinct, some changed, some new ones came along.
All kinds of shit was goin on.
Millions of different animals, bugs, birds, fish, etc.
Then, somehow, these fucking things called Humans came along, started actin' like they own everything.
Walking around, swinging their dicks around, beaming their pussies at everything, just taking over motherfuckers."
Ashley, brows raised and slightly taken back, was still listening.
She was focused, and was actually finding Cap comical.
"Anyway," Cap said, "Billions, Millions, thousands of years go by.
You know who has-whose always had-but still has the biggest dick and continues to slap motherfuckers senseless with it?"
"Humans."
"No!
Mother 'fucking' Earth."
"Wait, mother earth has the dick?"
"Look Ashley," he leaned forward again.
She joined him as their faces were inches apart hovering over the middle of the table.
"You asked me how I can still eat meat and be Mother Earth's Jules Winnfield?
Because whether I'm eating a cow, some kind of genetically engineered leaf from a lab, or a juicy, tender, succulent leg of a bronto-fucking-saurus, me and Mother Earth are still gonna kick ass.
We're gonna be walking through the woods, and see two people come along, one swinging their dick, one waving their pussy around, and we're gonna grab that dick, grab that pussy, bash em together, and throw em in the fucking ocean!"
Cap sat back in the chair and took another sip of his drink.
Ashley patted her mouth with a napkin and leaned forward on the table over her crossed arms.
With a come hither motion from her finger, the rest of her red glossed nails clicking together in her palm, she smirked at him.
As if under some spell, Cap floated back the table.
She leaned in and brushed her delicate plump lips against his ear as she whispered to him with the softness of cotton.
"I want you to fuck the shit out of me."
The moment the sharp words hit his ear, Cap, like a reflex, squeezed the paper cup in his hand.
The rest of his drink burst up out of the cup and splashed on both of their faces.
They both sat back quickly, Cap with a look of horror on his face, his boner nearly flipping the table up and across the floor.
'This is it,' he thought, 'I just ruined the date.'
As they started to wipe the cold ice tea off their faces, an enormous weight lifted off his shoulders.
Ashley burst out in laughter, as Cap quickly joined her.
Simultaneously, they hopped up out of their chairs, threw away their trash, and walked outside together.
It was late in the dead parking lot-a faded street light glowed down on the space between their cars.
Cap, with his mind and heart racing, got in his car and shut the door.
He paused as he noticed he hadn't said anything to her, but instead shot straight into his car.
"Ugh.
Idiot."
Before he could jump back out, Ashley had already planted herself in his passenger seat and shut the door.
"Oh, hello" he said.
She flashed that devilish smile at him once again.
She glanced down at his pants, at a rod shaped outline pressed against the denim.
A nervous Cap shrugged as he positioned his arm over his pants, in an attempt to conceal it.
Ashley slid her arm under his and started rubbing.
The black Tesla began to rock back and forth in the quiet mid night of an empty Taco Bell parking lot as one of the employees sitting at a table inside ate his lunch and watched casually through the window.
It was the only time Cap had ever doubted his decision to purchase Gaea, the two seated minx, as they went at it like wild animals trapped in a cage.
With the warm, naked body of an attractive girl pressed against him, Cap had an unwelcomed and unfamiliar thought.
'This was...too easy' he thought.
He observed the situation he was in and realized that it wasn't new.
He had been here before.
'This wasn't a date' he admitted.
He also realized that he had very few real dates recently and no actual relationships in more than a year.
Once again, something that he had been actively looking for eluded him: a serious, meaningful relationship with a normal human being.
He looked at the girl on top of him.
'Is she the one?' he thought in a weak attempt to suppress his incoming depression.
In his head, he tried to evoke arguments for her, trying to be open to the possibility.
Anything from, 'she's got nice ears', to 'she's not the worst dresser in the world'-but he knew it was all bullshit.
'I'm doing it again.
I had the intention of getting to know someone, in an attempt to form some kind of relationship, and now, just mere hours later, my dick is about to be inside of her.
Is it my fault or hers?' he pondered.
'Why did she give it up so fast?
Why do they all?
Am I just...too sexy?
