This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

When she glanced over at him.
He was a god in her eye's.
His smooth chocolate skin  and well groom body that stuck out its chest like a soldier from all the push ups at one hundred and eighty five pounds Paul body made Tissy wet between her legs.she was so very  attracted to him.
Paul had his drink in his hand about to sit down Tissy  went over to him  to  ask for a dance Paul said yea if I can have one for free. she agreed and they began to.
Tissy invited Paul to Lunch he agreed to have lunch with her the next day. but he decided to warn her that he was in a relationship.
His woman was out of town.
Tissy was disappointed but she still wanted to be around him.
She started spending money on Paul because he wouldn't give her no dick.
Tissy couldn't understand not  too many black men would turn her down.
She have them all married, single, gay, perverts and all Paul and Tissy ran into Fesha at the store .Fesha was like oh, shit Tissy may.
Paul how you know Tissy.
The club so stay out my business.
Paul said do me a favor let Tissy hang with you guys today.
Tissy said naw i'm a stripper I don't whoe no more.
Fesha and here girls started doing a swag dance and breaking it down.
Bitch what he saying is your going with us.
What you fucking with Paul for if you not trying to bring him no  money.
Fesha said.
Bitch Paul a gold digger nigga never been a good pimp that's why he don't do it.
Tissy said what we going to do.
Bitch we go show you the ropes and block just in case you change your mind.
Paul said take care of her. don't let nothing happen to her. need to run a few errands.
You have my number.
Tameka was blowing Paul  cell phone up. she sent a text saying that she will be home early.
Paul said what the fuck.
Paul said change of plans.
Tameka coming home early .I can't come back to get you.
You can roll with them or I can take you back to the club.
Tissy of course wanted to roll with Paul but this time before she got out the car he couldn't get her off of him .
Paul was wrestling with her saying  that he was  inlove with his lady .
Tissy was kissing on his neck.
Paul said girl stop making a fool of yourself.
Tissy was burning with desire and he was going to give her some dick even if she had to take it.
Tissy say well why you with me than.
Paul said because your cool to hang out with.
Tissy started wrestling with him again saying that she didn't want to here the shit .finally Tissy broke Paul button off his slacks his hard on was in her pussy. she had slid herself on his penis  in the middle of wrestling with him.
Paul said Lord I didn't mean it.
I really don't want to hurt Tameka.
Tissy started sucking his dick all while Tameka was blowing up the text messaging.
Paul said baby I met you at the house.
I'm driving now from L.A.
He made it a few hours because he decided to stay in the car for a while Tissy  sucked his dick so good.
After Tissy damn near raped Paul he said they shouldn't see each other anymore.
Tissy said okay we will see.
And walked in the club.
Paul received another text from Fesha  saying by the way Paul remember  our visit in jail.you owe me bro fifteen grand.
I know I have half  of your money right here.
Paul stopped by the block to pick up Fesha to take her to the bank so she could deposit her money and they chatted like old times sake.
Paul gave her seven hundred and fifty dollars  Fesha stayed on the block getting her money.
After Paul dropped her back off  with wild cat sandy, and Olivia.
They out there selling pussy ,weed,ass and all Paul said.
That fucking trifling ass momma of ours Berneice did this shit to Fesha. what a bitch because her life fucked up she had to fuck up her daughter's life. what  a bitch Paul was saying to himself as he was driving home .
Paul was thinking to himself that Tameka was different than all the women he had dated most were hood lovers.but his baby momma Markele was a straight hood rat the kind that would have sex with your brother, uncle ,and cousin if he's fine.
Fesha never understand what Paul saw in Markele welfare ass .Markele collected welfare and sucked dick for Paul when it was really necessary.  none of Markele children are his except the first born Paul Jr.  Paul say's Markele  been sexting and cymber sexing other dudes for three years he don't know who she fucking .Fesha said she explained to Paul that he is her brother he can live with her when he gets out to get his life right he said that's cool his bitch will hold it down for him now.
Markele fucking some nigga called Juice what is Paul locked up for Drug distribution charges say's desire .Desiree say's rumors is she wants to marry juice because Paul will not do shit for his children or her's . he is too risky with his drug dealing ways.
She  and Juice has falling for each other.
Desiree replied with a smirk on her face that whoe just love dick.
That bitch ain't never love nobody but Paul.
Fesha started laughing telling Desiree about the time her and  Markele went to beat Mann Mann up for setting Paul up.
Girl we beat the shit out of Mann Mann.
I didn't have a clue what was going on .all I know is the bitch said Mann Mann and my brother.
I snapped and went to his house with her.
Mann Mann was beating our asses until Markele picked up the knife and stabbed his ass in his ass. you should have seen Mann Mann face girl after we went in his ass with that toilet bowl plunger.
Girl,can you image our sixteen year old  asses whipping on this big black Samoan looking motherfucker.
Girl, I think Markele taught me how to fight that day. i have never beat a man ass like that since.
And its due bitch it's time me and you  go whip up on some of these streets nigga's about Paul. they trying to keep Paul locked up . those dirty ass cops right with them.
Yep, by the way juice uncle is a cop Paul told me at visit and guess what else I heard Bam is the cop son.Thats why he wouldn't take no one to his house. don't mention it to Bam that you heard.
I'm going to find out for real so I can relay this to Paul.
Bam is about to be ransom if this cop want too play dirty.
Bam gone need a gun and we sending that bitch to the pen or a sore ass if that dirty ass cop fuck over Paul for juice. people can say a lot of things about Berneice but she will not fuck with no cops not even for money.
Berneice been a whoe all her life and never been to jail for it. because she stay away from fake ass bitches who stay in and out of  the jail smiling about the cops and she stay away from cops.
De I do the same .so we expect you too do the same.
You know Mann Mann wouldn't do business with Paul any more after that .Paul never knew why because none of told. we were all to scared to go to jail even Mann Mann was hoping his warrants wasn't showing up in the hospital. we didn't go to jail because Mann Mann wouldn't talk to the cops  he knew that he had set Paul up for the cops. girl we beat his ass.still to this day he runs when he see either of us.he think we still hanging out.
They started laughing out loud.
Markele is nothing but a dick down dutch bag now .Desiree said and started laughing.
Fesha said well get ready because this time we gone tie up a cops son and ransom his ass to expose his dirty as cop father to the world of internet and the streets. open pussy whoe Markele can take the fall for this one.
Paul  is cool with Tameka he even talking about marriage. now that's something new that he didn't do.
I met her when I went to see Paul last week.
Fesha said why didn't you tell me that you were going to the jail to visit .she would have went with you.
Desiree said anyways.
Tameka got her shit together.
That one whoe Berneice was calling one silly ass bitch last week is her real sister.
Fesha said or you serious.
De said yes I am. the one big Mike always whipping on  her and treating her like shit is her sister.
I didn't tell her that shit.
But I'm sure she has heard its all around town. she's not taking anymore charges.
Markele claims to be getting her life together and that she is not taking anymore charges for a bum ass nigga.
Desire looking painfully as they talk about her brother Paul its only the three of them and she seem to have all the sense for the three of them.
Paul has been in and out of jail since he was nine. momma said Paul should have been a boxer because he never lost a fight but he wanted what was in the streets instead. momma said  there is nothing in them streets but trouble and that's all Paul ever got from it. a jail sentence , a stab womb and  children .He say's he's not the daddy of the other two only Paul Jr. the first born .
Paul Jr. is a little fanatic of video games at four.
Really he nearly mastered .
Hard To Kill some shooting game .but I guess it impresses people.
''Really''  Fesha looked with such facial of  amazement.
No one in her family really did anything but  the streets except her dad and he didn't even come around since they all grew up.  she refuse to call a dad who knows that he has children out here.
She use to go see Jr. all the time.
Now she is all about her money.so it's in the way and Markele not with her brother no more so she don't really go around her as much.
Fesha thought to herself she needs to go pay a visit to her nephew.
De and Fesha started laughing.
Desiree stated damn I miss Paul,'' he crazy as hell always have a smile on his face .His baby mama Markele claiming that she pregnant with this other dudes baby she said Paul need to be a man and step it up.
Patricia  started yelling''that was Desiree niece which was Fesha eight year old daughter .
I'm telling on you boom boom .I'm telling auntie what you did or you better give me some of that candy. or I'm telling Auntie.
I saw you Humping Tenesha in the bathtub boom boom ''.Desiree is  anxious to get off the telephone with Fesha ''see you when you get home sis.
Stated Desire stated .
I need to go now those brats of yours are up to something .Fesha responded with okay sis. talk later babe.
Sis when Shawn arrive tell him that I will be there in a about fifteen minutes.
Desiree proclaim with an nonchalant jester whatever.
That loser.
Desiree  started to call Patricia,'' in a child like voice what were you yelling about telling me what ?
Patricia said nothing Auntie.
Jeremiah began to raise his voice while they were  saying uh no I didn't auntie. don't believe that we were  playing .
But he gave her some candy that's why she won't tell you.
Desiree said he gave Tenesha some candy.
Okay well you getting  a whooping for lying and hiding something from and I told not to be humping and going on with each other.
Little nasty selves.
Auntie Desiree started to yell at them all.
I told all you guys that's bad for family to do to one another.
Matter of fact no television tonight or tomorrow , stand in a corner for thirty minutes no sweets for two weeks.
Jeremiah you and Nate can go play basketball at the park be home by the first shade of dark take this cell phone in case of emergencies.
Jeremiah and Nate took off to go play ball at the  park.
As Nate walked out the door his dad Shawn is walking up to the entrance.
Shawn grabs his son and hug him than he gave Nate a hug because he knew Nate Dad Samuel.
Samuel was sentence for arm robbery and Murder .
Samuel was  a champ a bread winner.
He now resided in Wall Walla state Penal system in Washington state .Being from Oakland California he didn't get a lot of visit's.
He had female pen pals who  would visit him and write him letters from time to time until they found real boyfriends .he did his crime in Seattle Washington .He ran major dope on occasions from Portland to Seattle to Tacoma, and Oakland he knew people when it came to getting his money.
Those people weren't reliable when it came to the joint and never was Fesha .Fesha got to eat to she would say. she couldn't continue to wait for Samuel. on the social tip Samuel was scarce it was just him and his lady.
He did most of his dirt alone.
If he needed a hand with his dope getting in the streets . he knew a few young foot soldiers who had his back that he could give a brick or two to and  they would come back with his money.
Samuel was a child who grew up fast .Samuel was pimping three months after he left his mothers  home .Although they were rivals from different hoods.
Shawn  respected the brother for being loyal in more than one way.
Even thou he always looked at Samuel as being a damn fool for doing that crime to get Fesha the best things in life.
That's why he will never  really know who Jeremiah is unless he gets a miracle. he always had one of his siblings dad's as a dad .Jeremiah dad is doing life in prison on arm robbery and murder. occasionally his mom will take him to see  Samuel his dad.
Samuel  was a hard core gang-banger  and street hustler before he went into the pen .Samuel loved Fesha he would give Fesha the world if she asked him too. but he was also very jealous hearted of anyone that came between him and Fesha even his own child if It needed to much attention .Samuel would kill for Fesha if he had too .In a literal sense.
Samuel jealousy and constant being under her made Fesha crazy sometimes.
Samuel wouldn't ever trust another man around Fesha .
She was his man chic  his rib, ride or die chic he could get her to whoe for him, strip,and still make love to him like he was real man her one and only man .Fesha and Samuel was definitely a boss ass couple two years ago.
She played around with Mike and Samuel  hearts than.
Samuel won here because he was a boss ass gangsta nigga.
This nigga said that he refuse to let her handle the streets alone if he was constantly having sex with her.
He explain he wasn't trying to be that other nigga.
Fesha used Mike for what he was worth because they had a  daughter together.
Mike never really took Fresha serious the sex was convenient easy and maintained.
Mike had no street ability college boy from a wealthy family.
How he got with a whoe he didn't know .All he could say was that she wasn't always like that.
If you  were someone who knew about it.
If you question him about it.
Fesha's behavior.
Samuel and Fesha kept the block hot with their decked out in gear, jewelry,  weed, cars, dope and homies .Samuel was a king pin than, he ran the whoe track dope trap and the stick up game.
Samuel was better known as Mr. Menace to those streets .
Paul knew Samuel growing up in school in the seventh grade he was actually from a good family and home.
