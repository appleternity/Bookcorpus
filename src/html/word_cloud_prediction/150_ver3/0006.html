This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically

That Lady Sutherland seems a witch to me."
"Quite so," Annabeth volunteered agreeably, "Now, what say we three join forces for the evening.
As I see it, we three have the power, if we stick together, to refute any attempts by Lady Sutherland to besmirch our collective reputations.
There is safety in numbers, you know.
So, what say you?"
"Oh, I say, that is quite sporting of you, Miss Fletcher," Felicite agreed, "Please, count me in." "Me, too," Maryann added happily.
"Thank you, my newfound friends," Annabeth responded, "And please, call me Annabeth.
Now, let us join in the festivities and sniff out what nefarious plots there may be lurking about."
And so saying, Annabeth smiled brilliantly and took her leave of the pair.
"My, she was quite charismatic," Felicite whispered on her parting.
Apparently deep in thought, Maryann responded, "Yes, she was.
I don't know her all that well, but I've never seen her quite so engaging as tonight."
"Well, I feel much safer with her in our camp," Felicite suggested, "Things seemed to be getting out of hand until we met up with Miss Fletcher."
"I agree," Maryann replied, at which she turned to the bar and ordered a scotch and water.
Turning back to Felicite, she queried, "How about you, Miss Fifi?
Shall you throw caution to the wind?"
"I think that I shall stick to French wine," Felicite responded cautiously.
"My, my, is that French arrogance, or are you simply playing up your feline role?"
"Neither," Felicite replied.
"I am simply going slowly for the moment to keep my senses about me.
I am still contemplating exactly what Lady Sutherland was getting at."
"Seems clear to me, Fifi.
She's looking out for the flyboys.
And she is either doing a very good job of it or a very bad job of it, depending on one's point of view.
Which one it is remains to be seen."
"Why do you say that, Maryann?"
"I'm just thinking out loud.
Are you really serious about playing into her game, Felicite?"
"I don't know what you mean by 'playing into her game', Maryann."
"I mean, are you up for showing these flyboys a bit of your knickers?
That's what I mean!"
"I am not quite certain, Maryann.
I'm saying that I'm not ruling out anything at the moment.
Let us simply wait and see, shall we?
At any rate, in this costume, I suppose that technically I am already showing a bit of my knickers!"
"Ha!
That is certainly true!"
Maryann responded gleefully, but then, changing her demeanor, she added in all sincerity, "Still, I'm darned if I'm falling for her line.
I am here to have a good time, but I intend to keep my clothes on, and I mean everything!"
At that moment Robert the Robin came up beside them at the bar and interjected politely, "So, ladies, how did it go with Lady Sutherland in the sitting room?"
"Perfect," Felicite replied noncommittally.
Immediately contradicting her, Maryann interjected, "Quite bizarre, if you ask me, Mr. Rob Rob Robin."
He chuckled at her seemingly endless misnomers, but then asked in evident confusion, "Exactly how do you mean?"
"She seems to think that you flyboys deserve some special attention by the young ladies who are visiting this weekend."
"Oh, that," he responded with embarrassment, "I am afraid my mother has some quite unusual ideas."
"She's your mother?"
Felicite blurted.
"Yes, of course she is.
At least she was the last time I checked my birth certificate," he replied with flippant arrogance.
Glaring reprovingly at him, Maryann expostulated, "So you are the future Earl, and you're a part of this whole deplorable thing!"
"I say, I'm not quite certain I get your meaning, Miss Amy," he replied with a mixture of bewilderment and politeness.
At this she responded derisively, "I should bet you don't," and with that she abruptly turned and walked away.
Clearly confused by Maryann's behavior, he asked Felicite, "What was that about?"
"Oh, don't mind her.
She's simply irritated."
"Why ever on earth for?"
"She thought that we were invited here this weekend because we are important," Felicite replied self-deprecatingly.
"But you were, and you most certainly are, Miss Fifi!
I assure you, you were invited for very special reasons.
You were screened quite carefully by my mother.
I just spoke to her, and she told me that she had extremely high hopes for you in particular.
She seemed to think that you might be the key to the success of the entire party!"
Now herself insulted, she responded carefully, "And what do you mean by that, Mr. Robert the Robin?"
He returned her gaze doubtfully, as if he had no idea why she looked so irritated to him, but she knew better - she could see that he was most certainly in on his mother's clandestine scheme.
"Well, I'm sure I have no idea what you mean," he responded in apparent confusion and, plunging yet deeper, he added, "My mother indicated to me that she thought that your French background might be just the ingredient needed to rouse things up.
I'm certain that she said it just so, Miss Fifi."
Downright affronted by his insinuating remark, Felicite was now convinced that this was all nothing more than a devious ploy by him to entrap a few naive young ladies into a weekend of frolicking with his fellow soldiers.
And to think, she had at first fallen for it.
It was now apparent to her that he was nothing more than an aristocratic fop, and an immoral one at that.
Accordingly, she responded with obvious annoyance, "I doubt very seriously that I shall be anything of the sort, Mr. Robin.
Now, if you will excuse me, I think that I shall make the rounds and meet some of the lads who are not so opinionated about people of French ancestry."
Having said this last, she forthwith turned on her heel and marched to the adjacent room as nonchalantly as possible.
For his part, Mr. Robin was left to gape in confusion at the two lovely but enigmatic young ladies who had both succeeded in insulting him within an hour of the party's commencement.
Quickly finding Maryann already surrounded by a half-dozen entranced airmen, Felicite nestled up beside her as if to say, "Introduce me, please."
Maryann caught on immediately, announcing, "Gentlemen, this is my roommate - Miss Fifi the Feline."
"Hello, gentlemen," Felicite volunteered seductively.
Suddenly there were numerous pairs of eyes glued to the attractive young lady before them, her costume clearly striking her intended mark.
From there events improved quickly, so much so that within an hour Felicite and Maryann were the life of the party.
Things were by now going so swimmingly that all thoughts of Mr. Robin and his mother fleeted from the minds of Maryann and Felicite.
Both pleasantly tipsy, they found themselves flirting with a captive group of intelligent and attentive young males.
Life was at that moment quite as perfect as it could possibly be.
Within the Library
Robert the Robin found himself approaching the lovely young lady in the royal blue evening gown.
Reaching her side, he offered, "I say, that is quite a lovely gown, Miss, er...?"
"Why, thank you, Mr. Robin.
I am, for the evening, Miss Eloise," she responded turning to face him head-on and, presenting him with her most impressive smile, she continued with, "Of course, I already know you, at least by name, Mr. Sutherland."
"Oh?"
he replied in confusion.
At this, she volunteered, "Annabeth Fletcher, daughter of the Viscount Morton Fletcher, of Oxfordshire," subsequently holding out her gloved hand for his.
Accepting the proffered hand, he leaned forward and supplied the requisite feigned kiss, subsequently responding politely, "Ah yes, I've met your father, and a brother, too, if I am not mistaken."
"Yes, of course, that would be my older brother, also named Morton, after my father."
"Ah, yes," Robert the Robin responded, "Sooo, we two appear to be the only members of the nobility here tonight, excepting Lady Sutherland, of course."
Evading the obvious implications, she replied pleasantly, "Yes, so it would appear."
"I assume from my mother that you are a student at Oxford?"
he queried.
"Yes, and quite lucky, I suppose," she responded.
"How so?"
he inquired vacuously.
"Actually, although women's colleges were founded in the nineteenth century at Oxford, it hasn't been that long ago that women were accorded full equality at Oxford."
"Yes, of course," he replied, "Silly, isn't it?"
Her eyes flashing defensively, she responded, "Silly?
In what way?"
Sensing his gaff, he responded, "Oh, I say!
I'm quite sorry.
I meant no offense.
What I meant to imply is how truly unfair it is that it has taken so long for women to receive full equality within the British Empire."
"Ah," she replied, her frown disappearing, "Well said, sir.
You seem to have extracted yourself quite nicely from that one.
I trust you meant it."
"Of course I did," he replied, still embarrassed, and searching for a face-saving means of retreat, he offered, "I say, Miss Fletcher, I must admit I find you quite lovely."
"Thank you," she replied noncommittally, "And?"
"And..."
he stammered, "Well, er, one cannot predict what shall transpire over the next few months, but if all goes well, might you consent for me to call upon you?"
"Why, that is most kind of you, Trant.
May I call you Trant?"
"Yes, of course, Miss Fletcher."
"Please, call me Annabeth, if you will."
"Yes, of course.
Then shall we say, when the battle is ended, I shall search you out, Annabeth?"
"Nothing could possibly please me more so," she responded politely, and seeing he was about to make his withdrawal, she took his outstretched hand and added pleasantly, "I shall look forward to it, Trant."
For his part, Trant found a new spring in his step as he made his way to the ballroom, whereas, having achieved her first and only objective for the evening, Annabeth secretly pronounced the party a perfect success.
At eleven-thirty the butler circled through each room, announcing, "Gentlemen, it is time to gather in the bar for Lady Sutherland's surprise entertainment.
Please make your way there now.
This way, please!"
"Ladies, if you will please follow me to the library," he subsequently entreated, upon which the young ladies commenced twittering to one another as to the meaning of this development.
The lads all crowded within the bar and, as a means of preparing for the upcoming festivity, they served themselves with potent nightcaps, thereby heightening their already libidinous anticipations.
"I say," Trant's friend Walter offered, "What is going on, Trant?"
"I'm certain I've no idea," Trant responded sheepishly.
"Surely you should know something, if indeed anyone should," Walter queried.
"What?
Why should I?"
Trant inquired vacuously.
"Just tell me this, Birdman," Walter said accusingly, "Who is planning the evening's final event?"
"Oh, that," Trant murmured dismissively, "My mother is, of course.
I should have thought you would know that, Walter."
"Aha!"
Walter exclaimed pointedly, "I knew it!
I knew something untoward was going on!"
Self-consciously brushing back a wayward feather, Trant replied, "What the...what in tarnation are you talking about, Walter?"
"How soon we forget!"
Walter expostulated, "How soon we forget!"
"Forget?
Forget what?"
"Trant!
You seem to have forgotten telling me not three days since of your concern that your mother had something up her sleeve."
"Oh, right..."
Trant mumbled, "Supposing I did.
What has that got to do with it?"
"Everything!
It's got everything to do with it, my friend."
