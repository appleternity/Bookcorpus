This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Transition_to_a_quality', 'tfidf': 1.5833030939102173, 'lexical_unit': 'go.v', 'definition': "An Entity ends up with a particular new Final_quality.

For living entities, this may entail a proliferation of instances of the entity, or of desirable properties associated with the (single) entity. For non-living entities (economies, political locales, academic topics, etc.), this entails a proliferation of instances, or of activities that lead to instances, or any attribute that would prevent the entity from disappearing. This state is conceived of as temporary, or at least contingent on a number of changeable factors.

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Chapter 24
After over a week in D.C. Trent was no closer to finding out anything about why Kodi would kill himself.
They had buried his ace yesterday and he knew men weren't supposed to show emotion, but he'd grown up with Kodi.
They were boys.
He'd be lying if he said part of him hadn't been buried underground with Kodi.
"You holding up okay?"
Phylicia asked softly walking into the hotel behind Trent.
She could tell by his demeanor that he was hurting.
"Not really, but I'll be good."
"You sure?
I can come up with you if you need the company."
"That's probably not a good idea.
I'll be cool.
See ya later."
Phylicia watched as he got on the elevator and shut the doors without asking her if she was going up.
Trent entered his hotel room and shut the door.
There was so much he couldn't and didn't understand.
Looking down at the box Kodi's mother gave him.
He wondered what it was.
Kodi had left the box in his mother's custody with specific instructions to be given and opened by Trent should anything happen to him.
Trent found it odd that Kodi had expected something to happen to himself.
Just as Trent was about to open and search the box, a light tap came at his door.
Putting the box on the floor by the bed, Trent looked out the peephole to see Phylicia standing there.
He sighed with mild frustration.
Phylicia smiled up at Trent when he opened the door.
She could tell that he didn't want to be bothered, but she didn't want to be alone tonight and figured why should she be.
"What's up?"
Trent asked not wanting to let her in.
He knew what Phylicia wanted and he didn't want any parts of it.
"I don't think you should be alone right now, so I'm going to entertain you."
Trent gazed into her eyes and parts of him could remember why he had fallen in love with her all those years ago.
Phylicia gloated on the inside.
He was softening like he always did where she was concerned.
"I don't need to be entertained.
I need to be alone."
"No you don't.
If I leave you alone you're going to be in here driving yourself crazy with memories of you and Kodi."
Trent hated to let Phylicia see him hurting, but his emotions had taken over the last couple of months of his life and were whipping his ass.
"It's ok, baby.
I'm here for you."
Phylicia said attempting to pull Trent into a hug, but was interrupted by someone knocking on the door.
"You expecting company?' "No," Trent replied moving away from Phylicia's failed hug attempt.
Trent was shocked after glancing through the peephole and realizing who was on the other side of the door.
Suddenly, his spirit lifted and he was anxious to open the door.
"What are you doing here?"
He asked after throwing open the door in excitement.
"Even though I'm going through hell at the moment, I didn't want to leave you to go through this alone."
Shia said taking notice of Phylicia sitting in the room with a smug look on her face.
"Though it seems you already have someone keeping you company."
"Oh," Trent said forgetting that Phylicia was still in the room," P just stopped by after the funeral to check on me.
She's about to roll though."
Phylicia was appalled.
Who the hell did Trent think he was just throwing her out like that?
"Hello, Phylicia."
Shia broke the awkward silence in the room by being cordial, "Long time."
"Obviously, not long enough."
Phylicia responded with a snide attitude.
"Baby, I thought I was keeping you company."
She said invading Trent's space trying to push up on him.
Trent politely moved away from Phylicia as Shia made herself comfortable in the room, by taking off her cardigan and removing her shoes.
"Thanks for stopping by P.
I appreciate it."
He held open the door so she could exit, "Have a nice evening."
"You're really throwing me out because she came here?"
"Yo P," Trent let out a tired sigh, "I'm not throwing you out.
I said thank you for the company, but I'm a chill with Shy right now.
Aight."
"Whatever nigga."
Phylicia mugged Shia before exiting the room in a huff.
"What's up with her?"
Shia asked.
"You know how P is.
She doesn't mean any harm."
Shia rolled her eyes at his delusional statement.
"Yes she does.
Some people just never change."
"I don't want to talk about her.
What really made you fly down here?"
"You."
Shia said slowly removing her clothes.
"I need you to help me forget just for a little while all the crazy shit I'm dealing with right now and I'm sure you could use a distraction as well."
The magnetic pull of their bodies is indescribable.
Whenever in each other's presence, sharing the same space and air, reality ceased to exist, in the darkness, and running her hands down his sculpted back, Shia could feel every breath that Trent took.
The closeness they shared was unimaginable.
Everything about them felt so right, but was happening so fast.
Was this how life was supposed to be?
Lovers tend to be in their own world, creating their own reality, relishing in it always ready and willing to justify it.
Consumed in her own thoughts, Shia was caught by surprise when Trent kissed her neck.
Immediately moaning and seeking more of his touch, she was enchanted.
The scent of him alone could make her body pulsate.
Turning her face slightly so her lips could reach his, she kissed him longingly trying to memorize the shape and feel of the contours of his mouth.
Everything about Trent excited Shia.
The sound of his voice, with its deep, slow drawl and New York laced accented slang and the way his eyes roved over her body making her very aware of her womanly charms.
As he brought his hands to the small of her back and gently began to massage her there, Shia's breath caught.
She was becoming undone.
She lived for these moments, the moments when Trent was caressing her and making her feel like the only woman in the world to him.
Trailing his fingers up her nude body, he brought his hands around to graze her erect nipples.
Letting out a low, slow moan, Trent bent his head to capture one into his mouth.
Audibly sucking in her breath and whimpering softly, Shia wanted to die.
How could this one man make her feel like putty in his hands?
Slowly, but firmly guiding her down on the bed, Trent followed every motion of his hand with his tongue.
With Shia now lying down, he was more able to explore the full length of her.
Kissing underneath her breast, he slowly trailed his tongue to her belly button, where he could lick circle patterns.
Gingerly lowering his kisses, Trent arrived at the bud he was seeking.
Gently sliding Shia's legs further apart, he softly kissed her magical spot.
Unable to contain herself, Shia's breathing quickened.
Trent knew exactly what to do to excite her.
Darting his tongue in and out of the parted lips that covered the flourishing bud he wanted to suck on, Trent grabbed Shia's hand, placed it to his head, and let her guide him to the place she wanted.
Head firmly in her favorite spot, Trent sucked and licked Shia until she was nearly jumping off the bed.
"Baby, please."
Shia moaned breathlessly.
That was his undoing.
Not being able to hold back any longer, Trent let his tongue send her to orbit.
Recovering any sense of what was going on was hard, but Shia had to try.
She had no idea how long she had zoned out after Trent had sent her to the moon.
Turning her head, she could see him waiting patiently for her to regain her composure.
Completely nude with his body looking like a Greek god, Shia noticed that his member was standing at full attention and ready for anything she had to offer.
It's as if Trent's body was calling her name and who was she, not to answer its call.
Shifting slightly so she could be on top of Trent, Shia kissed down the length of his body until she found what she was seeking.
Erect, posed and ready, Shia took all of Trent in her mouth and gently began to suck on his head.
Licking small circles with her tongue, she slowly worked her mouth down the full length of him.
She knew he liked it by the way he grabbed the back of her head and moved it and his body in sync with one another.
Now saliva induced, Shia took both hands and began to massage up and down Trent's shaft.
He moaned deeply as Shia sucked a little harder and increased her hand motions.
From the jerks of Trent's body, she knew he was on the verge of cumming, flicking her tongue over the head again and continuing her swift hand motions; Shia smiled as she felt Trent's eruption filling up her mouth.
Swallowing his savory reaction to her hand and tongue game, she knew he was satisfied.
Lying on her back beside him, Shia felt Trent kiss her on the check and wrap his arms around her.
Speaking softly he said, "You give that grown woman lovin' and nothing compares to that."
Smiling to herself in the darkness, Shia wrapped her arms around Trent as well and they lay together as Shia fell asleep peacefully.
As Shia slept, Trent got up and retrieved the box Kodi's mother had given him.
Unable to sleep even after Shia's good loving he decided to go through the contents to see if Kodi may have left him a clue as to why he had shot himself.
Opening the box, Trent could see that it held an envelope, a tape recorder, and a videotape.
Trent played the tape recorder first.
"Aye yo, T, shit is crazy.
A nigga just bout to hang it up.
Seriously, the heat coming down fast and hard.
It's my fault.
I didn't have to get involved, but I did.
I didn't know D was that damn crazy.
Shit about to hit the fan.
Watch your back T.
They all involved in it.
It's been years in the making.
Phylicia used to be married to D.
How we miss the radar on that shit?
This shit is deep.
D was messing with Shia Mom's my nigga.
I don't have the whole story on that, but her parent's death was reopened from the cold case files and forensic could match cigarette butt samples w/D.
I think he killed their parents and was on some revenge type shit to take out the whole family.
I ain't know that shit at the time, but shit wasn't adding up so a nigga had to start investigating.
