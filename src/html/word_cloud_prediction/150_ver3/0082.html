The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The Part itself connects locations within the building to each other, Connected_locations. If a particular point of view is adopted in the context of real or imagined motion, then one of the locations can be construed as Goal and the other as Source.   'It was of great interest to me to see the star signs of Taurus the Bull and Leo the Lion on the staircase to the upper Palace.'  'All visitors may use the elevator between the Main Level and the Upper Level instead of the main staircase'  'The window into the garden was open.'"}, {'frame': 'Cause_motion', 'tfidf': 0.700733638726384, 'lexical_unit': 'draw.v / fling.v / lift.v', 'definition': 'An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

"Fuck you!"
Amon's eyes flashed with anger and he gave her a little shake.
"Tell me, female, or I'll crush all the bones in your legs!"
Hexa's eyes widened in fear at his threat.
She knew he'd follow through with it too.
"It's...a blaster.
Well, Jax called it a blaster - he made it."
"I see."
Amon crushed the gun into a ball in his bare hand and made sure that Hexa was watching him.
"No!"
Hexa cried out.
Amon removed the other gun from Hexa's holster next.
"And this one I remember...what was it called again?"
"A sonic shotgun," Hexa snapped.
"Another weapon far too dangerous to be left in the hands of the humans."
Amon crushed it to pieces next.
"No," Hexa murmured sadly as she watched the pieces of metal fall and hit the floor.
Her gray eyes teared up, but she wouldn't let her tears fall.
She'd failed...failed to avenge Jax.
And now she needed rescuing.
I'm so pathetic.
But even if I send an SOS no one would be able to get here in time to save me.
I'm so dead.
Unless that someone could teleport, a voice piped up in Hexa's mind.
That's right!
Malakye Sterling could teleport.
She hated asking him for help, but she had no choice.
As stealthily as she could Hexa got out her smart phone and began to text Malakye behind her back.
She needed to buy herself some more time...
"Amon, there's something that's been bothering me all this time.
Why didn't you kill me that day...you killed everyone else.
Did you leave me alive to suffer?"
Hexa questioned with a tremor to her voice.
Amon arched a brow at her.
"I didn't spare you.
By the time I was battling you I'd used up most of my venom on the others in your squad.
My venom killed them, and I injected what I could into your legs, but obviously it didn't kill you.
Somehow, you managed to survive and escape the temple without my noticing.
And your legs...were paralyzed as a consequence of having that much venom pumped into them apparently."
Hexa's eyes widened with this startling revelation.
All this time I thought Amon left me alive so that I could suffer over the loss of my brother.
But it was just an accident.
This meant that in a way her squad had truly protected her life with theirs.
Their sacrifice hadn't been in vain. Guys...Jax...thank you.
"And now I will rectify my mistake and kill you...slowly for your defiance, human female."
A sinister smile curled Amon's lips.
No!
Hexa mentally shouted.
Amon began to constrict his tail around her legs and Hexa let out a scream of terror.
She could feel her bones breaking!
At that moment, Malakye materialized inside of the restaurant and looked around.
He swiftly spotted Hexa in Amon's clutches.
"Hexa!"
He raised his hand and called out, "Time Stop!"
A blue stone pendant glowed brightly on Amon's chest, and nothing happened.
"What the hell?"
Malakye muttered darkly to himself as his brow furrowed in confusion.
Amon turned his golden gaze to Malakye.
"Did you just try to use your infamous 'Time Stop' on me?
Well, it's a good thing I decided to team up with the Lunarians.
Garnetta gave me this pendant yesterday at the club Iron Casket as a gift of thanks for my loyalty to their cause."
The demon fingered the pendant thoughtfully.
"So that's why you were there at the club yesterday," Hexa said through gritted teeth.
"You were forging an alliance with the Lunarians.
Dammit..."
"Amon, let Hexa go!"
Malakye demanded sternly.
He didn't like the sight of blood on Hexa's leg braces one bit.
"You're going to have to make me, Malakye Sterling," Amon challenged.
"Well, I plan to."
Malakye whipped out his wooden sword hilt and willed a blade of psychic energy to form.
He pointed his glowing blue sword at Amon threateningly.
Amon reached up and undid his turban to reveal his head of live, sandy-colored cobras before tossing his turban to the floor.
Malakye charged towards Amon, and the snake demon slithered across the floor towards the alien with incredible, superhuman speed.
Amon lowered his head and willed his cobras to attack Malakye simultaneously.
"Bite!"
Malakye dodged spitting cobras and swung his sword.
He ended up chopping off a few of the cobras' heads.
Amon let out a roar of outrage in response.
"How dare you...!"
The demon regretted that he didn't have his usual scimitar with him.
Amon let out a frustrated sound before tossing Hexa aside.
She went flying and hit the floor hard and rolled across it.
Hexa let out a yelp of pain.
"Hexa!"
Malakye called out in concern.
He turned to glare at Amon, his emerald green eyes flashing with rage.
"You bastard!"
He attacked again.
However, now that Amon had his tail free he began to put it to good use.
Amon sent his tail flying towards Malakye who was forced to jump up to avoid the deadly tail swipe.
Then Amon brought his tail up and then down, intending to simply smush Malakye like a pancake.
Malakye used all of his skill and reflexes to dodge out of the way.
Amon was fast.
And Malakye was quickly tiring.
The battle against Garnetta had taken a lot out of him and he hadn't had the time to soak up some moonlight.
This meant he was running low on psychic energy.
The wounds on his back had also barely had time to heal and he could feel the wounds opening up again.
Amon attacked Malakye with his snakes again and the alien sliced off another cobra head.
Amon snarled, and whipped his tail out at Malakye, finally managing to trip the plant alien.
Oh shit.
Malakye tried to scramble out of the way, but it was too late.
Amon coiled his tail around the alien's legs and began to drag him across the floor.
The tail began to coil around Malakye's torso and kept his arms pinned to his sides so that he was unable to use his sword.
Once Malakye was in front of Amon, the demon flipped the alien onto his back.
"And now you die, Malakye Sterling."
The demon reared up over Malakye, and his snakes hissed in Malakye's face in unison.
"No, Mal..."
Hexa murmured as she watched what was happening from her place on the floor.
The snakes reared and prepared to strike.
Suddenly, the door to the Chinese Food Restaurant was kicked in and Agent Darkhart strolled inside with an air of authority, his long black trench coat billowing out behind him.
"Well, what do we have here?"
Agent Darkhart started in his gravely voice as he took in the scene before him.
His eyes narrowed into slits.
"Let Malakye Sterling go, Demon Commander Amon."
At that moment several super soldiers began to pour into the restaurant.
Amon could sense these men were not fully human and so posed a threat.
"Fuck.
I don't like these odds."
Amon hissed in Malakye's face.
"You got lucky, boy."
The snake demon released the alien and shot off, slithering away in the direction of the kitchen.
"After him," Agent Darkhart directed his men with a wave of his hand.
"Yes, Sir!"
the soldiers yelled out before pursuing Amon, guns raised.
Malakye quickly got to his feet and made his way over to Hexa.
He crouched at her side and frowned when he saw the horrible state she was in.
She was fading in and out of consciousness due to the excruciating pain she was in.
Her legs...were a mess.
Malakye swooped Hexa up into his arms and cradled her against his chest.
Agent Darkhart approached them with swift strides.
Hexa struggled to open her eyes and glanced at Agent Darkhart.
"Agent Darkhart, you came to rescue me?
How did you even know where I was?"
A slight smirk formed on the agent's thin lips.
"I went to your room to speak with you and saw what was on your computer monitors.
I watched the footage of Amon at Iron Casket that you'd retrieved.
I then used your facial recognition software to track him down...and you."
He reached out and patted her arm.
"I'm glad we made it in time, Hexa."
Wonder flashed across Hexa's face.
"Aren't you angry with me?
I broke the rules?
Aren't you going to punish me?"
Agent Darkhart looked at Hexa's bloody legs and frowned.
