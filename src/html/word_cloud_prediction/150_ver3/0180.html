NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

"Ninety-days were allowed."
For a moment, the words didn't register, then Mark froze, almost sending the car into a roadside hedge.
He managed to hit the brake pedal, then sat for a moment listening to the engine ticking over and the sounds of distant birdsong and bleating sheep.
"What?"
he asked, stupidly.
Like it's going to explain itself.
A couple of minutes passed as the sound of a distant aircraft grew and then faded.
Mark's heart finally stopped pounding.
He looked at the GPS screen, saw nothing but the blue line of his designated route.
He heard the sound of another engine and saw a car appear up ahead.
He was stopped at an angle in the middle of the narrow road, so he had no choice but to move.
As soon as the car started moving, the device spoke up again.
"Follow the road for another fifteen miles."
"Screw you," he replied, but without much force.
When he changed gear to tackle an unusually steep hill his hand shook, and he fumbled at the stick, producing a grinding protest from the vehicle.
Did I really hear what I think I heard?
There were only two possible answers, neither of them reassuring.
Even with the windows open, the car seemed stuffy under the cloudless June sky.
He decided to drive on until he found a place where he could stop and take a break.
Luckily, he soon found a small village with a pub, and pulled into the car park.
He got out to stretch his legs, and as he closed the car door, a gust of wind blew into his face.
He had hoped for a cooling breeze, but was disappointed.
If anything, the gust of air was warm.

"You're saying he's on his way to Northumberland?"
asked Jo.
"I'm afraid so," said Ralph Minns, raising his hands in a gesture of helpless apology.
"You haven't been keeping track of his blog?"
Seeing Jo's incomprehension, he led her into his office and clicked on his computer.
"I'm rather proud to have played a small part in young Mark's odyssey," explained Minns.
"I worked out his itinerary."
Jo looked at the screen to see a series of blog entries by the American lecturer, evidently recreating a tour of Britain by some long-dead writer.
It all seemed innocent enough.
It just happened to take Stine far away from her, and any questions she might have had for him.
"So Doctor Stine is going to Skara Farne?
That's quite a trek."
"Oh, I agree," said Minns, "but it's all down to the itinerary I prepared for him, you see.
It's the trip that Montague Summerskill made just before the First World War, during which he was inspired to write some of his best ghost stories."
The librarian gestured at some dusty boxes on his desk.
"I've been rummaging through the Summerskill papers, they're quite fascinating.
A form of detective work, you could say."
"Yes, I'm sure," said Jo, politely.
It hadn't taken her long to conclude that Minns was the sort of man who would happily chat all afternoon, to anyone, about anything to do with his job.
This might make him an ideal source of information on Morgan, or a total waste of time.
"Of course," Minns went on, "it's all thanks to Dylan Morgan that the papers are in such good order.
All neatly filed and cataloged!"
"Morgan?
What's he got to do with it?"
"Oh, he did his doctoral thesis on Summerskill back in the Eighties, when he was an undergraduate.
And part of his research inevitably involved sorting out the old boy's letters, manuscripts etcetera."
Minns reached into the nearest box and took out a sheaf of papers.
"For instance, these are all Summerskill's letters to his brother, who was a priest in Ireland."
"Fascinating," said Jo.
God, if you exist, please let this not be a coincidence, she thought.
"Yes," said Minns, "though it's surprising that old Dylan put young Mark on the Summerskill trail.
He's been rather protective of that particular author."
"Protective?
You mean secretive, in some way?"
she asked.
"Oh, you know how academics are," replied Minns.
Then, seeing that she clearly didn't, he went on, "Territorial, I mean.
They get an obscure author, write a thesis and then a book or two about them, and this stakes their claim.
Sometimes these apparently mild-mannered academics can get very spiteful if someone else offers so much as an opinion on a pet writer.
I'm sure detectives don't want other people nosing around on their turf, either, do they?"
"True enough," she conceded.
"But let's focus on Morgan.
So why do you think he suggested Doctor Stine do research on his territory?"
"Well, he made a point of befriending young Mark when he arrived," mused Minns, evidently thinking about the matter for the first time.
"A foreigner in Cambridge often feels like a fish out of water.
Especially since some of the older academics regard all newcomers as potential usurpers.
The cold shoulder is a common response, I'm afraid."
"But Morgan befriends them," said Jo.
"All these potential usurpers?"
"Sometimes, if they're in a similar field," agreed Minns.
"Mark Stine, for instance, teaches Gothic fiction, which overlaps with Morgan's area, Victorian and Edwardian literature."
Jo took a deep breath.
She had a feeling that her next meeting with Superintendent Masson would be something special, even by his standards.
"You said you'd been working here for over twenty years," she said.
"Cast your mind back.
Would any of these young lecturers that Morgan befriended have met with sudden, untimely deaths?"
Minns' eyes widened, and he seemed about to laugh.
But then he caught himself, and his face took on a more thoughtful expression.
"You know, I do recall an unfortunate accident.
In fact, there may have been more than one ..."

"You not minding the shop, then?"
Sharkey asked.
"I could have nicked dozens of them mugs and tee-shirts and bookmarks.
Bankrupted your precious Trust."
"What do you mean, about the ritual?"
asked Lucy.
"What ended it, if not the war?"
Sharkey lumbered into the office, making it suddenly seem far smaller.
The fisherman was, thought Victor, somehow too large for the indoor world.
"You shouldn't muck about with that stuff," said Sharkey, nodding at the computer.
"But I'm wasting my breath telling you that.
So I'll tell you something else.
That ritual was a warning, not to tamper with the Abbot's domain.
It ended 'cause some fool woke the Follower."
"Who?"
asked Lucy.
"Can't recall his name.
Some writer from London, or down in the south anyway."
Sharkey gave a dismissive shrug, showing all the true islander's distaste for mainlanders.
"Point is, he woke it, and then the Follower wasn't something you could joke about any more.
All that remained of the old customs was a nursery rhyme my mother taught me.
Told me to stay away from the Red Abbey, she did, or the Abbot would set his Follower on me."
Victor frowned.
"This is the first I've heard of this."
"It's not something we share with outsiders," declared Sharkey.
"You won't find it in your books, or on your computers.
But I'll make a gift of it for you now."
He recited.
"Water and earth and fire and air, Seeks you out and finds you there.
Air and earth and water and fire, Never does he pause or tire.
Fire and air and water and earth Rue the day that gave you birth.
Earth and fire and air and water, Curse is cast, you're lamb to slaughter!"
After a moment's silence, Lucy asked, "Happy childhood, was it?"
Sharkey snorted.
"My old mum knew what she was talking about.
Never name it, she told me.
Never talk of it, even in whispers, even in roundabout ways.
Never mention that other one, either, the one who brought it here, used it against his enemies in olden times.
Both bad ones.
Never to be mentioned!"
"And yet here you are, positively blabbering on the topic," pointed out Victor.
"No point holding back now, is there?"
retorted Sharkey, angrily.
"Bloody outsiders, been meddling for years.
Over a century.
Keep bringing it back, agitating it.
And that's bound to end badly.
Not just for the victims, either."
He walked over to the office window.
"You're full of dire warnings, Sharkey," she said, "but what can we do about it?"
He stood looking out at the ruins of the Red Abbey.
"Nothing you can do to stop him or his servant."
Victor and Lucy rushed to the window in time to see a robed figure vanish behind one of the few abbey walls still standing.
"Was that him?"
asked Lucy.
"Abbot Thomas?"
"Oh, aye," said Sharkey.
"He never rests easy when the Follower is away.
Stir up one, you stir up the other.
That's how you can tell the Follower's out tormenting some poor soul.
Old Thomas goes on patrol around his old domain."
Chapter 10: The Island
Mark arrived at Skara Farne at high tide.
He cursed quietly at his own failure to anticipate a problem that Summerskill had made such a point of emphasizing in his story.
The island, the writer had explained, 'is perhaps all the stranger because it is partially linked to the mainland by a causeway that the restless North Sea tides submerge twice a day'.
