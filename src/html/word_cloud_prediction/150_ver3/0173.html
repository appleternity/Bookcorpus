By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

The uniform stepped out to intercept him, his hand up.
"Stop right there."
Bill noticed the other hand resting on the sidearm and dropped his pace down to a walk.
"It's okay, I'm a cop."
He reached towards the front pocket of his jeans to pull out his I.D. again and the cop reacted.
"Freeze, don't move."
Bill froze like a statue, held still by the business end of the handgun.
"I'm getting my I.D. out," Bill waited.
"Go ahead," the cop nodded, "slowly."
He carefully slid the small wallet out and opened it towards the officer.
The man stepped forward to get a closer look.
"Where you from?"
"Colton, California.
I'm working a case.
Bill Dewton."
"And you ended up here in our freight yard?"
The cop was curious.
"I'm following a trail of bodies and they all come from rail yards.
You got one?"
Bill pushed the matter.
The cop hesitated, then he nodded towards the tight knot of cops near the freight train "You won't believe it, see for yourself."
Since the guy didn't seem inclined to explain any further, Bill followed the cop towards the others.
He was introduced to the group as they shuffled aside to make room for him to see what was causing the commotion.
He was perplexed by the sight.
He knew exactly what it was, a mummy.
But what the hell was it doing here?
The edges of the wrappings were burnt and the whole thing bore the scorch marks of having been on fire.
No one spoke and he knew the drill, but these being cops, he was sure there were punch lines waiting to come.
"Okay, what the hell is this?"
No smart-ass stepped forward with a wise crack.
Unusually, everyone remained quiet.
It seemed they were on edge.
Finally someone answered.
"The guy was mummified.
Are these things supposed to burn up?
It's like something went wrong."
"The poor bastard definitely started to cook."
Bill shuddered.
The guy had been slow roasted, mother-of-lord.
"Where was he?"
"A yard worker found him.
Saw a bundle of rags along the track smoking.
By the time he got here it was on fire."
The cop stalled a second.
"The worker said he rolled the bundle around in the gravel and sand on the edge of the tracks to stop it from burning up.
That's when we got the call."
"Can you make out anything on the guy?"
Bill had to know as much as he could.
"Look yourself.
Face wasn't too bad but it did melt a little.
The rest of the guy is a mess.
I figure we'll have to wait for the coroner to open the wrapping."
The cop was being pretty straightforward.
"But the yard worker was looking around for more bodies when he found some burnt rags and this book in a boxcar."
"Can I see it?"
Bill reached forward.
"Sure, you seem to know more about these guys than we do."
Bill stepped forward into the floodlight.
Leaning down, he looked at the face, turning his head sideways to get a straight-on look. Shit.
He'd seen this guy before.
Where?
He flashed through the images from the week, and it hit him.
This was the guy he'd seen on that other freight train as they passed each other in Spokane.
He'd had a bad feeling about the guy back then, and now here he was, killed in some bizarre fashion.
He was sure this had to be another high-ranking Raildog.
He'd give anything to see the inside of the victim's wrist but knew that wasn't happening.
This body was going to a lab.
Period.
For some reason he thought of the rider he'd just seen heading out of town on the passenger train.
He shook his head to clear it.
He didn't need distractions.
He didn't want to wait for autopsy results either.
If he missed catching the leader here, he was down to whoever the number two Raildog was, and that meant Phoenix.
He thought about the intense stare of the rider that was dressed all in black.
"Can someone check out my hit criteria in the system and call me about this guy's results?"
Bill left his cell number before heading back towards the southbound tracks.
He quickly checked the small black book into his inside coat pocket, hopefully he'd be long gone before they discovered he hadn't returned it.
"Where you going?"
One of the officers yelled at his back.
"Phoenix."
There was only one left.
***** Texas Sam Dorson struggled to the top of the stacked containers at the rear of the train.
He wanted to get up as high as possible where he would be able to see well and to hide even better.
Once on top, he inched over to look down the side.
Two groups of men were walking down the train, searching inside the cars.
There were too many of them to be cops.
Someone yelled from the other side and Sam inched over that way.
Damn it.
He watched three Raildogs jump out of the car where he'd left the woman and start towards the other men.
As the group spread out it became apparent his guys were out-numbered.
Sam didn't move a muscle.
The three Raildogs realized their mistake too late and were quickly surrounded.
He tried to look away when he saw the clubs and bats, but couldn't stop himself watching as his crew was beaten to a pulp.
The newcomers surrounded the door to the boxcar where he had stashed the woman and one of them climbed in.
The last of his men was thrown out into the crowd, he didn't fair any better than the first three.
Sam kept watching, he wanted to see what happened to the woman.
She'd been something else.
He was surprised when she was helped off the train, the newcomers giving her room as she got down.
It hit him that they were a little late to the rescue.
Then he couldn't believe his luck.
He'd known there was something about her, obviously something special if this many people came looking.
How did they know where to look?
Then Sam realized the woman's boyfriend must have had a hand in this; which made him wonder about his other men who had jumped off the train to deal with him earlier.
Shit, how many men did he have left?
He smiled to himself, he'd had her while he could.
Yes sir, he did.
When the men fanned out to check the last boxcars, walking around the end of the train, Sam rolled to the center of the container and lay on his back staring at the sky.
He didn't move at all.
He hardly breathed.
As the group headed back to the front of the train, he dropped his head back down against the cold steel in relief.
Once the train started to move again Sam realized they had been stopped at one of hundreds of road crossings that littered the rail line.
As the train picked up speed, rumbling through the intersection, he could see a pair of dump trucks alongside the road.
A number of pickup trucks were already leaving.
Sam was shaken.
These guys had the balls to stop a train.
They must have put out lights that the engineer saw, with the trucks on the rail the train had no choice but to stop.
Balls, that's for sure.
Chapter 15 Phoenix, Arizona David arrived in Phoenix and headed right for the east-west lines.
He knew the number two Raildog didn't venture far from his section, and spent more time on the rails than the other bosses.
Phoenix or Houston?
One end, or the other?
Where was he?
David knew the run always came west to start the month and he wondered if he had missed his target.
Knowing where they hung out and where they jumped off the trains was helpful, and David set himself up where he could watch for a while.
When midnight came and went he was confused.
Pulling out his little book, he rechecked his data.
The train was late.
What the hell?
He didn't want any surprises at this point.
Everything was too close to a conclusion.
Shifting around in his hiding spot, he was getting uncomfortable and pissed off.
He didn't need this aggravation.
His tight schedule didn't need any last second changes.
An hour later David was still vigilant.
Trains came and went, but he still wasn't seeing the one he was watching for, then he heard one slowing as it approached the station.
There it was, late, but finally here.
This one came all the way from Houston.
It had potential.
Scrambling down from his vantage point, he worked his way closer to the track.
He used the shadows to move towards the old building knowing where the gang usually hung out.
David had already identified where the outgoing eastbounders were parked and he'd set his trap well.
Now he just needed a body.
When the train was almost stopped he realized that anyone on board should have jumped by now.
He was almost ready to give up, then he saw a flicker of movement.
A figure dropped down out of a car and landed crouched beside the track, pausing to look both ways before straightening and starting to walk.
It was obvious the guy was alert, he was swiveling his head to look around, checking over his shoulder.
Did he have some warning?
David didn't think so, but he had to expect anything.
When the guy turned away from the train, angling across the tracks towards the old building, he knew it was time.
He wouldn't be able to make a positive I.D. until the man was closer and he was able to get a better look.
