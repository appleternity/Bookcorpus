This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

"Then I will refer you right to the Alpha."
"How long will I have to go through the counseling?
"I can't answer that question, it is all up to you and how your respond."
"Then I will try the counseling but I won't make any promises on how I do."
"There are no promises in counseling."
"OK I'll give it a try."
"Good that's all I or anyone here can ask.
Until I say you can be left alone you will be staying in the holding cell."
"I understand."
"Mark you can take him back."
"Ok doc, Let's go Mr. Tolbert."
The four guards escorted Tolbert back to his holding cell and Tolbert asked, "Sir, what's it like, being a Lycan I mean."
"Son, I personally have found it to be one of the most rewarding things in the world.
You see I wasn't born a Lycan.
Jacob the pack Alpha helped turn me into one with the help of a Shaman.
It was something I wanted.
I was married to a female Lycan when I was a human.
Now we are mates and trust me there is a big difference."
Mark and the three other guards left Tolbert and went to the office area of the holding cells and Mark told the other three "You be careful around him I don't trust him, I think he is playing a game."
"Will do Mark."
All three answered.
"I'll check back in before evening."
Dr. Deal called for Jeff Miller to come to her office and he was pulled out of class to come and see the doctor.
Jeff knocked on the Dr. Deal's office door and when she told him to come in he opened the door and went in.
"Have a seat Mr. Miller."
"Thanks doc, I can sure tell you things are sure looking up for me, and all thanks to Mr. Jackson."
"That is really good to hear, Have you found things different being here?"
"Oh god yes being a half breed and being accepted is great."
"You seem to be enjoying yourself here."
"Doc you have no idea what I went through the last eight years.
Not being near a pack was hard but not getting beat on or spit on made it all worthwhile, I can tell you life is good."
"Let me ask you this when you graduate, what happens if your assignment takes you to your old pack?"
"That's easy I'll have a partner and together we will handle it, the Retrieval Agent will have done all the messy work and if I should have to go down there by myself, again it's easy if they want to start in on me all I have to do is call my boss."
"Well I think you have adjusted well here."
"Mr. Jackson has been a big help, he is working with me and it has really built my confidence up."
"Well it shows."
"Thanks doc."
"How about we meet in two weeks.
If everything is the same then you won't need to meet with me anymore."
"Sounds good to me."
"Thank you Mr. Miller."
Jeff got up and left the office and returned to his class, there was a bounce in his step that had been missing for years.
Dr.
Deal started to write her report on her first three patients as she had about half an hour before her next appointment, her telephone rang and it was Greg Jackson, "Doc can you please come over to the admin building, I have something I need you to look at."
"Sure Greg I'll be right over."
Doctor Deal left her office and walked to the Administrative building and when she rounded the corner she spotted the Academy medical staff rolling someone out in a stretcher.
They put the person in the back of a SUV and pulled out and it looked like they were headed to the pack area.
She started up the stairs when Greg came out "Ah doc glad you could come over let's go into my office."
"Who was that they just took away."
"We will discuss it in my office."
Dr. Deal and Greg walked to his office and Greg offered the Doctor a seat and he walked around his desk and took his seat.
Greg stared at the picture on his desk for a second and started to speak at the same time that Dr. Deal did.
"Please Greg go ahead."
"Thanks Doc, We have had an incident that has me deeply troubled and I'm not sure how to handle it."
"What is it Greg?"
"The body you saw being rolled away was that of Tammy James.
Another student went to check on her today because she missed her class.
When the student got to Tammy's room she had to get a key from the building manager because the door was locked.
When they returned and the manager opened the door they were shocked to see a body outside the window and when they went to the window they found that Tammy had hung herself from the roof.
The manager checked her and she was already dead.
They could not get a hold of Mike or Alan so they called me.
I called you and Jacob before I went up to the room, my problem Doc is I have never been exposed to a Lycan that killed themselves."
"I would say that there are not many that have been exposed to that.
It is something that is very, very rare."
"I will set up some group and individual counseling sessions for whoever wants them and my suggestion to you right off the bat is don't dwell on it."
"Ok thanks Doc, I would like for you to go Tammy's room and go through it and see if you can find anything out that might have led to this."
"Will do Greg you have my number call me if you need anything."
"Thanks Doc." Dr, Deal got up and walked out of Greg's office and almost ran Jacob over.
Jacob stepped aside and let the doctor pass then walked into Greg's office.
"How are you doing Greg?"
"I'll be ok just puzzled as to why she would do this, but if I find out that this had anything to do with Tolbert I'll kill him."
"That's why I'm here, I knew you would feel that way and that's why I am turning this over to Mike and Alan, who should have it in the first place."
"Jacob, please don't, I owe it to Tammy and her father."
"No Greg this is an Academy matter and that falls under Mike and Alan, not the Rouge Retrieval Unit."
"But I was the one responsible for her coming here and I promised her father I would look out for her.
If you give this to Mike and Alan can I at least stay in the loop?"
"I'll think about it, I don't want you to do something you will regret with Tolbert."
"I just need to calm down a little and I promise you I won't do anything to Tolbert."
"I'll think about it, Greg."
"Thanks Jacob for giving that much."
When Mike and Alan get back here I want you to brief them on what you know and then step out of the investigation."
"Yes sir I will."
Jacob turned and left Greg's office and went up to Tammy's room and met Dr. Deal again.
"Doctor, finally we meet I'm Jacob Matthews, I'm sorry that we meet each other under these conditions."
"Mr. Matthews the pleasure is mine, and I agree I do wish we would have met under better conditions."
"Two things Doc, first please call me Jacob, and the second have you found anything that gives us a clue as to why she did this."
"So far nothing has been found no note or anything which in it's self is a little odd, what few suicides that have been recorded in Lycan history have all left a note."
"That is odd, anything else?"
"Not yet sir but I haven't been up here long."
"Ok Doc report to Mike Russell or Alan Smyth, I have taken this out of Greg Jackson's hands.
This falls under the control of the Academy and if Greg is needed then Mike or Alan will call him in."
"Yes sir will do."
Jacob left the dorm room and went to meet Mike and Alan in Mike's office, Jacob knocked on the door and walked in.
Both Mike and Alan rose and greeted Jacob.
"I want you both to know that all reports are coming to you two.
I know that Greg was the first one here but this is your Academy and that's where this all needs to stay.
I see no reason to involve other departments in this matter.
There is one thing you may want to consider and that is contact Mark Shuttle and bring him in he is a police officer and may be a lot of help in the investigation."
"That is a good idea, Jacob and thanks for keeping it in the Academy.
We will keep you informed every step of the way."
"Please do I need to keep the High Council informed, and I need to go make the first calls to them now."
Jacob left and headed back to his office in the Administrative building.
When he walked in his secretary Sally handed him a handful of messages.
Jacob thanked her and said "Sally I am going to be on the phone please do not let anyone disturb me and call Ben and have him come over here, I need to speak with him."
"You got it Jacob."
Sally responded.
Jacob walked into his office and closed the door, he dug out a list of phone numbers and started calling all of the Sub-Alpha's that made up the High Council.
Jacob spent the next hour making the calls when Ben arrived and came into his office.
"Ben thanks for coming, I hate to burden you any more than I already do but I need you to keep a close eye on the pack.
We have had a incident at the Academy that is going to take up a lot of my time for about a week."
"That's not a problem Jacob, you know you can count on me."
"I know that's why I don't worry about anything in the pack when you are in charge."
"That makes me feel good to hear you say that."
"You have earned all the praise Ben, and this comes at a bad time for you trying to get Asheville ready for the winter season."
"It will all work out."
"Speaking of Asheville how are things looking?"
"We are fully booked starting the second week in October and stay that way until the end of March."
"Great that is good to hear."
"Jacob you look beat why don't you get some rest, if anything develops I'll call you I promise."
"Actually I'm good it's been a bit of a drain with the Federation starting, the incident in California and now this over at the Academy all in just a few short weeks, but I have been getting plenty of sleep."
"Are you sure?"
"Yea Ben I'm sure."
Ben sensed the tone in Jacob's voice and he knew he was starting to push the limit and backed off and told Jacob he would be back later to tend to the evening pack business.
Ben turned and left the Alpha's office and went back to his home CHAPTER TEN Gail quickly climbed the stairs of Jacobs front porch and knocked on the door, Dawn answered and invited Gail into the house.
"I am so sorry to bother you Dawn but is Jacob home?
I must speak with him, it is a matter of life and death."
"No Gail he is over at the Academy."
"Oh no I cannot go there, the spirit will not let me, is there anyway we can get him to come here."
"Let me call him."
Dawn dialed the phone to Jacob's office and asked his secretary if she could speak to Jacob.
In just a few minutes "This is Jacob, may I help you?"
"Jacob this is Dawn, Gail is here and she says she needs to speak with you but the spirit will not let her come there, can you get away and come home to talk with her?"
"Sure, I'll be there shortly."
"Thanks Babe."
Dawn hung up the phone and looked at Gail and said, "Jacob will be here in a little bit."
"Thank you Dawn, I normally wouldn't ask but this is very important."
"Can I get you something to eat or drink?"
"Hot tea if you have it."
"Sure, it will take a minute to heat the water."
"Thank you Dawn."
Dawn looked back at Gail as she walked to the kitchen and thought she had never seen Gail so shook up.
In just a couple of minutes Dawn returned and had a cup of hot water with a tea bag seeping.
She handed the cup to Gail and she asked, "Is there anything I can do to help while we are waiting for Jacob?"
"Thank you but no, this is something Jacob must deal with."
Jacob walked in the front door and said "Gail good to see you again.
What can I do for you?"
"I'm sorry you had to come here and meet me but my spirit guide will not allow me to go to the Academy."
"Why is that, Gail?"
"It has to do with the Lycan that died there today and the treaty with the Vampires."
"What is it?"
