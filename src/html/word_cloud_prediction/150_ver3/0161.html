CHAPTER 16
The Ravenscroft Children
Damon
The Roma School of Dance, New York City, 1996
A class of young students warm up before their lesson.
They stretch and limber in front of the wall mirror.
The class is mostly made up of young girls but there are a couple of boys and one of them is a nine year old Damon Elton Ravenscroft.
Skinny, tall and of lithe appearance Damon has a feminine quality to his nature.
Coming from a surrogate mother there is no sign of Eleanor in his features but he is without doubt a Ravenscroft, possessing the same movie star looks of his father.
Piercing blue eyes and blonde sandy hair make him stand out from the crowd.
"Alright let's begin," Amanda Travis says clapping her hands.
The students move into position and begin their dancing as the music starts up on the CD player.
Damon instantly shines from the rest with his graceful and sure footedness.
He is the most popular student in the class and all the girls want to be his partner.
"That's it, that's it, stretch those legs, and stamp your authority on your partner.
That's it - excellent," Amanda Travis enthuses as her pupils get the moves right.
Watching quietly from the doorway is Eleanor.
She looks on with pride at Damon.
She had insisted to Zane that her children must have a sense of the arts.
Her love of music and reading of course stems from her own mother, Juliana, who had instilled this love in her before her untimely death.
To see Damon doing so well fills Eleanor's heart with joy in the sea of misery that surrounds her.
Although seeing so much of Zane in his looks and none of her always brings out a little bit of anger in Eleanor, but she has learned to cope with it.
Damon, like, Samantha and Bobby are her children.
Zane of course was becoming concerned about Damon's masculinity, he'd rather he play football or something equally as macho, but Damon wasn't like that, he was different.
There is a je ne sais quoi to Damon, a unique and rare quality, a charisma, even at this young age, which seems to have power over others.
He seems to be able to charm anybody or anything, even the birds out of a tree.
Amanda Travis was jubilant at having such a talented student in her class and only recently spoke to Eleanor about Damon's future tutoring.
"He's uncanny in his movements," she had said.
"All the students and teachers simply adore him.
His talent is far outstripping the others in his class and that's why, with your permission, I would like to put Damon into a one on one class in which he will receive more personal training."
At 39 years of age Amanda is a renowned teacher and a former ballroom champion dancer.
"Do you think he has that much talent?"
"Oh yes," Amanda readily agrees, "the classes are run by myself, Lisa Ryan and Natalia Olgoff and they're not only designed to give the student a more through education in the form of dance but to also hone in on which particular form of dance they're best suited for."
Eleanor came today to give her permission.
Zane raised an eyebrow.
But Eleanor was affirmative and got her way.
She wasn't a fool; she knows full well that in time Damon will have to take up a position in the Ravenscroft Empire, but that didn't mean he shouldn't be cultured.
And if it pissed off her husband, well, that was also just fine as far as she was concerned.
After class Eleanor and Damon sit comfortably in the back of the chauffeur driven limousine talking about his dancing.
"That Miss Travis is quite taken with your ability."
"She's wonderful," Damon answers his mother, "all the teachers are excellent mother."
"You'll have to work extra hard as these personal classes will take up more of your time."
"I know."
"Can you handle that?"
"Yes," he replies in a confident sounding manner far older than his age would suggest.
Eleanor shakes her head in bemusement.
"Is there nothing that fazes you, Damon?"
Damon doesn't answer.
He stares out the tinted window at the passing people on the street.
"Damon?"
Eleanor prompts.
"Not when you're doing something that you enjoy.
I love to dance, mother.
I intend to make it a part of my life no matter what I end up doing."
"I see.
Well, I'm glad you told me then.
You father might have other ideas."
"I know father doesn't approve of my dancing.
But as long as I'm responsible and help out the family he won't mind."
Damon's words are those of an adult.
Eleanor is again amazed by the maturity in him and can't help but thinking that perhaps there is an old soul in him.
"Are we still going to the symphony this week?"
"Yes, of course, Handel's Fireworks."
"Wonderful," he almost shouts like the excited nine year old he truly is.
"And shopping, will we still be doing shopping?"
"Naturally, this weekend is all about you and me."
"Thank you mother, this is going to be awesome."
Eleanor can't help but shake her head yet again at how one moment he can be so adult like and next so child like.
She hopes that there is nothing wrong with him mentally, but the child psychologists she has taken him to have all reassured her that Damon is a healthy boy with no mental or psychological problems.
A wunderkind, as Doctor Zimmerman put it.
It seems that Damon is destined to grow into a savant if given the proper environment and opportunities.
This is what Eleanor intends for him and to have and these personal classes with Miss Travis and her colleagues were just one step along that path.
Damon's personal lessons would become far more significant than anyone could possibly imagine.
Much, much, more.
Amanda Travis, Lisa Ryan and Natalia Olgoff would instruct Damon in far more important matters than just dancing.
They would give him the lessons, skills and tools to succeed in life.
The bond between them would become something other than just teacher and student.
His friendship with them would last through the remaining years of his childhood and on into his teen and young adult years.
In time Damon will come to look upon these three women as his Muses.
As for Eleanor, she encouraged the relationship knowing all too well that these three women could do more for Damon than what she could, especially given the circumstances between herself and Zane.
Tuscany, 2003
The sun shines warmly down upon the small rustic Tuscany village.
A picture post card.
The white and sandy coloured buildings shimmer in the glare but offer a cool waiting inside.
A short distance from this quaint setting an elderly man and his donkey carelessly stroll down a small dirt road past several vineyards with their rows of grape vines stretching off in the distance.
A few tourists wander around including a 16 year old Damon with Amanda Travis, Lisa Ryan, a 38 old semi-retired dancer and singer, who for a number of years was the toast of musical theatre on Broadway; and Natalie Olgoff, a 40 year old former ballerina.
The quartet is busy sampling the local brew and watching the wine making process.
"What a glorious trip this is turning out to be," enthuses Damon.
His muses have taken Damon on a European holiday, showing him the beauty of the world as well as continuing his education about fine wines, amongst other things.
They have been touring the wine making region sampling all that has been on offer; the Chianti; the Brunello di Montalcino; the Vino Nobile di Montepulciano wines made from the Sangiores grapes and the Vernaccia di San Gimigano from the white Vernaccia grape.
And of course the subtle dessert wine Vin Santo.
Add on top of this the delicious tasting food, and the group has broken a few of the seven deadly sins.
But today the muses have brought Damon to a small and un-commercialised vineyard where they still make wine the old fashion way.
Harvesting, crushing and pressing the grapes by hand, as well as the fermentation, clarification and filtration process followed by the bottling and ageing.
All this is done with great care and knowledge and Damon soaks it up like a sponge.
His passion for wine and the process for making it have grown intensely over the last year.
Where this zeal stems from he is not sure, the influence of these ladies is a part of it, but it is something much deeper within him than just that.
To him, he sees wine as not just a delicious beverage enjoyed across the world for its unique aromatic and flavour experience.
Wine has been around for perhaps 8,000 years or longer, made and drunk throughout the centuries, a part of civilization itself.
This red and white liquid is drunk at parties, weddings, and wakes and used in religious practices, whole empires from the past have lived and perished upon the wine trade.
To Damon, he is slowly coming to the conclusion that wine is the elixir of life, the true ambrosia of the gods, it is capable of bringing joy or sorrow, love or violence, and as any good alcoholic beverage it can make loose lips.
As one of Amanda's favourite authors, Eduardo Galeano said: "We are all mortal until the first kiss and the second glass of wine."
This trip is only solidifying Damon's beliefs about the power of wine over men and woman.
Later in the day they sit beneath the yawning of a local cafe enjoying the local brew with some fine cheese and fruit.
The heat haze fills the street as small urchin children play happily with sticks and stones, their imagination running wild.
"I say if we keep at this pace I'll surely lose what little is left of my figure," Lisa complains.
"Your beauty is not in question, Lisa," Damon tells her, "as for your figure, well, men like to have something to hold onto in the night."
Lisa laughs gaily.
"My dear, dear boy, you're an absolute marvel.
If you were but a few years older I think I would have you."
"Now, now, none of that," Amanda chides, "we're here to teach Damon, not seduce him.
Although I think our star pupil needs little help in the art of seduction.
That is one area I feel he shall have no problems in."
"Yes, Rachel still asks after you," Natalia says referring to Damon's first conquest.
"Rachel is a lovely girl, but she's just a child," Damon replies in a worldly manner.
"Look, who's talking," Lisa teases.
"No, no child, Damon is an adult," says Natalia.
"He is much more," praises Amanda.
"Too be in such beautiful company why would I want to be with anyone else," Damon says affectingly.
"Oh I could eat him," declares Lisa, "are you sure we can't have a little fun?"
Amanda raises her finger.
"Willpower darling, willpower."
"That's something I'm afraid I don't have a lot of these days."
"When did you ever?"
Questions Natalia.
"You know me too well.
But I am surely tempted."
"Most people can resist everything but temptation," Damon tells her.
They all laugh joyfully.
Damon's love for these women is strong and genuine.
Ravenscroft Bank, Los Angeles, Present Day
"This is some good wine?"
Max Crawford informs Damon as he drinks from a crystal glass containing the red liquid.
"What is the definition of a good wine?"
Damon replies cordially.
"It should start and end with a smile."
"A Burgundy?"
"A connoisseur, I see."
"I like to think so," Max Crawford says modestly.
"Your own brand I assume?"
Damon smiles.
"Yes, from my vineyard in the Napa Valley."
"Might have to get myself a case."
"Why don't you come to the vineyard this weekend, we're having a party, you're welcome to join us."
Damon offers.
"I'll even throw in a case of the Burgundy Ravenscroft."
"I've heard about these famous parties of yours."
