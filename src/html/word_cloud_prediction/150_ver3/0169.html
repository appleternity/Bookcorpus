For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

"Well, he's a bit of a scoundrel, but he's the best damn shot in the regiment.
Hard to keep a man like that down, eh?
I told him to look after you while you had a chance to learn the ropes.
I'm putting you into B Company.
You will be reporting to Captain Meadowes.
He's a good enough officer if not a little zealous."
"Good, sir."
He frowned at me and said, "I don't want you to do anything foolish, so make sure you listen closely to Meadowes.
The Germans are a crafty lot and have a few tricks up their sleeves.
If you do as ordered, you will have chance to get out of this war alive."
"I shall do my best," I said.
"Give me one more moment here, and I will find my servant Reese to bring you to your company."
Chapter 5
The Past
Smythe's servant was a big corporal named Reese.
He was a short man, but his size did nothing to hide his strength.
He was bullnecked and had long gorilla-like arms that hung loosely on his sides.
His face was craggy, and his lids hung over his eyes like slits.
As we walked along the communication trench, he showed little consideration for my rank - perhaps he had a dislike for Americans.
Or perhaps he'd taken airs as a result of being in the service of the colonel.
Who knew?
I just did my best to keep up with him.
While we crossed over the various hazards of the trench, he warned, "Telephone line low" or "Watch your step."
He left me at the B Company HQ, and I was glad to be rid of him.
The headquarters itself was a low, log structure built deeply into the side of the trench wall.
After pausing for a moment to gather my thoughts, I straightened my cap and pushed aside the black curtain covering the entrance.
Around a wooden table, four men were sitting and talking over cups of tea.
As they turned to face me, I took in the new surroundings.
The room was small with greasy oil lamps lighting the dark interior.
The floor was caked with mud with heavy boot prints.
Through a short passageway, I could see into a smaller room where a line of four cots were shoved together.
"You must be Grant," the captain said to me.
"I'm Meadowes."
He got up to shake my hand.
He was a tall man, with a stern face and a neatly trimmed moustache.
His black hair was tinged with grey.
The eyes were circles of exhaustion which seemed to be the case for everyone else here.
"Glad to meet you," I replied.
He pointed to the other men at the table and said, "These three gentlemen are Lyons, Carter, and Prentice.
You will be working with them closely, so you will get to know them well."
"Yes, sir," I replied with a salute.
Out of the corner of my eye I could see the three other lieutenants frown.
With a shake of his head, Meadowes said, "I have to tell you that discipline is a little more lax here in the trenches.
While you're here, forget everything you learned at officer school.
When addressing fellow officers, you can use their names.
Save the spit n' polish for the parade grounds."
I nodded, already feeling out of place.
"You already met your Sergeant Owens at the train station," Meadowes went on.
"He was looking after your platoon until you came along.
You're replacing Lieutenant Billings who was killed here last month.
I'm afraid that is fairly common around here."
"I shall do my best to stay alive," I said.
He put his arm on my shoulder and led me to the table.
"Have a seat and I'll make the introductions."
I took one of the chairs and sat down.
It was an old rickety thing and felt as if it was going to give way under my weight.
Meadows remained standing.
He said, "This here is Lyons."
Lyons was a strong-looking chap with light hair, the pale British skin that was so common, and an open honest face.
He beamed at me and said, "Good to meet you."
"And this here is Lieutenant Carter," the captain said.
Carter was a fine-looking gent with youthful features.
He couldn't have been more than eighteen years.
His voice squeaked out, "Hello, Grant."
We shook hands and his grip was weak.
He certainly wasn't the type to inspire confidence.
"And finally Prentice," Meadowes added.
The remaining lieutenant nodded in my direction.
He had dark, slicked-back hair and an aristocratic sneer.
He would have made an excellent villain for any play or movie.
With a dismissive nod in my direction, he lit a cigarette.
"Don't mind old Prentice," Lyons added.
"He doesn't talk to anyone unless they are royalty or rich enough to buy themselves into royalty."
Prentice snorted and Carter watched the two with a grin.
Lyons laughed, "Funny thing is I'm the second son of a duke while Prentice here comes from the merchant class.
It all sounds rather common to me."
Prentice's face turned a deep red, and he inhaled his cigarette vigorously.
"I would have you know that my father is rather wealthy and could buy your whole postage stamp-sized estate without even breaking a sweat."
"I'm sure he could," Lyons laughed.
I noticed Carter was quick to join him.
"Settle down boys," the captain interrupted sharply.
Lyons smiled.
"You know as well as I do, Captain, that is an old argument.
This is the most awfully boring job at times, but we shouldn't make a bad impression on our new lieutenant here.
How about you, Grant?
Any skeletons in the closet you want to tell us about?
Around here, we're always interested in hearing something new."
"There's really not much to say," I admitted.
"I used to work in Chicago.
I have a degree in engineering, but it hardly made me any money."
"No rich father?"
Lyons asked.
The ever-present sound of falling shells suddenly grew louder, and to my ears, seemed to come closer to our dugout with every passing second.
The other men didn't appear to notice, so I went on and replied, "I'm afraid my father left me nothing.
He died a few years ago and left us penniless.
My uncle took mother in and sent me off to school."
"Ah, the rich uncle," Lyons said to no one in particular.
"Well, I for one am glad that you're here," Meadowes said.
He took off his cap and brushed his thinning hair back.
"This may be considered a quiet zone by some, but the Germans still keep us busy.
As I said, you're a replacement for Lieutenant Billings, who got the top of his skull removed by a sniper.
I don't want the same to happen to you, so listen to Lyons and Prentice here.
They're both experienced men."
"I will," I said.
What other choice did I have?
Now the impact of the exploding shells was maddeningly loud, and we had to shout to be heard.
"I can help too," Carter added over the din.
Lyons punched the young man in shoulder here and shouted, "Carter here is our newest lad.
Just been here three months, so don't listen to anything he has to say."
The lad shot him a dirty look.
The shells had passed over us, but still continued to fall unceasingly.
But now they were just muffled sounds in the distance.
Meadowes said, "Also make sure you learn what you can from your Sergeant Owens.
He can show you the ropes better than any other."
"He seems like a fine man," I said truthfully.
"But I don't want to be treated any differently than anyone else.
I'll take the risks like any other officer here."
"You have the right spirit, Grant.
Don't worry, I will have use for you here no matter what Colonel Smythe may have ordered me to do.
There are soldiers to be led and things to be done."
I nodded.
Since the short time I had met him I was beginning to like this Captain Meadowes.
He had a straight forward manner and seemed to act like quite the professional.
He said to everyone, "Prentice and Carter, I suggest you go about your duties for the morning shift.
I have to go meet with Smythe at headquarters and won't be back until two.
Lyons here will show our new lieutenant around and inform him of his duties.
For now, I've decided to put them on the night watch, so they had better get some sleep."
Prentice nodded and left with Carter in tow.
The captain poured himself another cup of tea before leaving the dugout.
Lyons nodded at me and stood up.
He had an athletic build, and he had to lean forward in order not to crack his head on the low ceiling.
"Well, Grant, I'm surprised."
"Surprised by what?"
"Talk is that the Americans are too cowardly to fight the Boche.
I'm glad to see that it is just talk."
"I'm not sure about my countrymen, but I was willing to come over and lend a hand."
Lyons shook his head.
He said, "You may be changing your mind sooner rather than later.
Let me show you the trenches and a thing or two to keep you alive."
We walked out of the dugout.
I followed this veteran's example as he walked towards the front line in a crouched position.
We went over the squeaky duckboards, passing a group of soldiers who smiled readily at Lyons.
He gave the men a hearty wave.
We soon stopped when we came to the end of the communication trench.
We were right on the front.
The front lines were dug deeply, with wooden slats on the bottom and wooden supports on the sides to hold the sodden dirt back.
Taken from a nook, the lieutenant handed me a periscope that was bent at ninety-degrees and was designed to look over the side of the parapet.
I gingerly edged it over the side.
Across the desolate landscape, I could just make out the German line in the distance.
It looked much like ours, with stacked sandbags and wooden posts.
