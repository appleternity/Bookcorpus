This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

He was hoping the Bed and Breakfast was not too far from Main and Main as he wanted to be able to watch the intersection from his room.
He had specifically told Mike to request an upper level room on the street side, if at all possible.
Doc knew that in a small town, sooner or later everyone passes through the main intersection to get somewhere and he wanted to be able to see them all, especially this Dirty Dan that Mike had told him about.
He found the Bed and Breakfast in the beginning of the second block.
Just two houses down from the intersection of E. Main and Prairie which was the first street east of Main and Main.
Not too bad, he thought, I guess it was too much to hope for that it would be in the first block and easily overlook the intersection.
Now, he thought, if the room just fronts Main street.
He found a parking place out front and walked up the board steps of the two-story frame house.
As he opened the front door a bell attached to the top of the doorframe jingled and a middle-aged man quickly appeared from somewhere in the back of the house.
"Yes, sir.
May I help you?"
the man asked pleasantly.
"My name is Bill Collins and I believe you have a room for me."
"Oh, Yes, sir, Mr. Collins.
I've been expecting you.
Thought you might get in earlier than this."
"Well, I didn't get up too early this morning, because it was only a two-hour drive, but I wasn't aware of the lay of the land and it actually took me four hours," Doc responded just as pleasantly.
The man smiled a little and said, "Yeah, that is one crooked road up from the south.
Doesn't get any better north of town, either.
In fact, I believe it is worse up north.
Now, about that room.
According to your travel agent...I believe you wanted a room fronting the street, correct?"
Doc smiled to himself.
Mike must have phoned the Bed and Breakfast instead of stopping in or got someone else to call.
Doc guessed he wasn't the only one travelling incognito.
"Yes, if it's no trouble," Doc said and continued, "I like to see and hear the cars.
Doesn't seem so lonely in a strange town that way."
"Travel a lot do you?"
the man asked, clearly just making conversation and not being nosy.
"A little, but more so lately.
I'm retired and I like to look around for likely places to spend the rest of my days," Doc said simply.
"Well, this is a nice little town.
That is, if you like to be away from it all.
We are so far away that sometimes we get the news on the TV two days late," the man ended with a laugh.
Doc smiled and chuckled at the man's humorous remark, more out of politeness than sincerity.
"My name is Jim Shrock and I'm the owner, proprietor, chief cook, and laundry man around here," the man said and extended his hand with another friendly smile.
Doc shook the hand and the man continued, "let me show you to your room and then I'll come back down and help you upstairs with your things.
Only one other guest right now.
A motorcycle guy.
He don't say a lot and he looks kind of rugged, but he seems harmless enough."
After Doc and Jim Shrock had carried all of the bags upstairs Doc started sorting things out.
He had brought plenty of clothes, not knowing for sure how long he might have to be here.
He quickly arranged things and then decided he had better check the view from his room to the intersection.
It was quite a ways down the street and it would be hard to recognize people from this distance with his old eyes.
Then he noticed to his surprise that on the northeast corner, across from the filling station, a tree was planted right in the sidewalk.
Around the tree was a large square of grass about the width of the double sidewalk and under the tree, to his complete satisfaction, was a long park bench.
He smiled to himself and thought, just like home.
Who needs to sit in a dreary room and watch people when you can sit under a shade tree on a park bench and sip coffee?
What a more natural place to be anyway.
No one would think much about him sitting there all day long and watching traffic.
Also, it would be a good way to meet people and find out about this town.
He was willing to bet a lot of people passed that bench on the way in and out of the bank and that was exactly where he was going to be--starting right after a supper.
He hurried through the supper that contrary to what Shrock had said earlier about being the chief cook, his wife had fixed, without seeming to hurry.
The supper wasn't much anyway, the only people at supper were him, Jim Shrock, and his wife Betty.
Just as soon as he had finished and expressed the normal gratitude and compliments, he excused himself, saying he thought a little walk around town was in order.
No one was at the park bench when he arrived and he took up a comfortable position.
The night was cool and there was still two or three hours of daylight left, but he stuck it out to watch the people and cars.
The only problem was that there weren't any cars or people to watch.
Traffic didn't exactly consist of too much in this town. ~*~ Two days passed before Doc saw the man he was really looking for, he left his room and slipped easily and nonchalantly up the street on the far side, opposite the Bed and Breakfast.
As he reached the corner, he quietly and as indifferently as possible, eased up and sat on the opposite end of the park bench.
Doc did not even look his way, being careful to stare straight ahead or toward the gas station, which was not open yet this morning.
This has to be Dirty Dan, he thought.
Mike had described him and had said his smell kept most people away.
He had to agree that it would.
The wind was not blowing, but he could smell him from the other end of the bench.
He was wishing for a breeze when Dan suddenly got up and started across the street toward the gas station.
"Nice morning, isn't it?"
Doc said to the man's back.
Dan never even hesitated.
He just kept walking and stepped out into the street to cross.
On impulse Doc yelled, "Wait, doctor!"
Dan stopped in mid stride and hesitated, but he did not turn and then started to walk again.
"You are a doctor, aren't you!"
Doc yelled loudly.
Dan stopped again, turned, and walked back to Doc's side of the street and stood stock still on the edge of the curb, for what Doc thought was an eternity.
Then he looked full at Doc and said, in a clear voice, with impeccable diction, "You look a little old to be a private investigator."
Doc was taken aback by that comment and finally sputtered in response, "I'm not a private investigator."
"Then why have you followed me to this town and why have you been asking so many questions about me?"
Dan said smoothly, but firmly.
"I was curious, that's all."
"Curious why?"
"Curious to meet a doctor who wants to help the children of this town, but is satisfied to watch them pass this corner in a hearse."
Dan took another step toward him and Doc could see that he was seething.
He thought he might have pushed too far, too fast.
This man could be mentally unbalanced and he had not been in a fistfight since his high school days--he had lost that fight.
But Dan stopped short of him and just stood there.
Doc watched silently as the angry look on his face subsided and he noticed a glistening in Dan's eyes.
Dan turned silently to walk away again, but Doc was not going to let him go so easily.
He knew he had reached him, but not enough--not yet.
"That's it, Dan.
Just turn and walk away.
Cry about it, but just walk away.
Maybe you ought to run, and when the next hearse passes this corner you tell yourself you did all you could.
You tell yourself that wishing will make it all better.
You don't have to do anything, Dan, just wish it away!"
he spat out with his heart racing.
After all, he thought, this guy really could be dangerous.
Dan stopped and stooped over, as if struck by a club.
His entire body visibly winced at the blow of the words and suddenly Doc wished he hadn't said them.
No, I'm glad I did it, he thought, it had to be said.
Dan slowly turned and Doc could see the glisten in the eyes was gone.
Now the eyes held a fire, not anger, but determination and calculated steadiness.
Dan said, "My name is not Dan, I'm not crazy and I gave up wishing years ago.
Now all that I ask is to be left alone."
"That won't wash and you know it.
We can't hide from the world and we can't hide from ourselves.
You think you have done both, but all you have done is nearly destroy yourself and missed the opportunity to help a lot of your fellow men."
"I can't help my fellow men.
Not anymore and if they knew why, they wouldn't want my help anyway."
"My name is Bill Collins and I'm a doctor, too.
You are a doctor, aren't you?"
Dirty Dan looked at Doc for the longest time and he was clearly calculating whether a response should be made and if so, what response.
Then he said, "Yes, I'm a doctor, or at least, I used to be, but now I'm just Dirty Dan and I like it that way."
"I doubt that's true," Doc said evenly and firmly.
"You doubt what is true?"
"I doubt you like being Dirty Dan or that you like the kids making fun of you and calling you crazy.
I doubt that you like smelling like a sheep pen all of the time and living in that hovel across the street, but for some reason you feel it is necessary.
Are you punishing yourself for some past short coming or are you on the run from the law?"
Dan walked slowly back to the bench and sat down heavily, staring blankly across the street, with his chin in his hands and his elbows on his knees.
Doc figured he sat there for a good ten minutes before Dan finally said, "You are close on both counts, Doctor.
My name is Jesse Blockman and I once was a doctor.
A good one, I thought, but not anymore.
"You are right about the kids.
It tears me up inside to hear them taunt me and know they think I am lower than dirt, which I may be.
Still, I sit here on this bench almost all the time they are playing in the street and watch them.
I love them, every last one of them and I would do anything I could to protect them all, from anything."
"Not quite," Doc put in, "You didn't do all you could for the last little boy who passed this corner in a hearse.
You knew he was suffering from classic shock.
Your diagnosis was textbook, but you just stood and watched him die.
Why?
"And don't give me that bull about not being a doctor anymore.
A doctor is a doctor until the day he dies.
Maybe he stops practicing or slows down a little, like I did, but he never stops being a doctor.
It gets in your blood.
It becomes instinct.
I heard about your instinct from a friend.
I knew a doctor had spoken those words as soon as I heard the diagnosis.
Only a doctor could say it the way you did.
A doctor cries when he loses one and every time he loses one.
Maybe only on the inside, but he cries just the same."
Jesse sat for a long time staring out across the intersection and then he said, "You're right, Doctor Collins, I could have saved him, but I didn't.
I hate myself more each day when I think of it, but if I had it to do all over again, I still wouldn't save him.
I can't be a doctor anymore, not ever again.
A long time ago, in another world, I killed a child not any older than the one who passed by here in the hearse and I will never be a doctor again."
Now it was Doc's turn to be silent and he was silent so long that Jesse began speaking again.
"Ten years ago I was a resident at St. Mary's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
I was a specialist in pediatric trauma.
Generally, I dealt with the gravest of head injuries.
I was good, very good, or so I thought.
One night, after all day on the floor and countless emergency surgeries, I made an entry on a little five-year-old girl's chart.
