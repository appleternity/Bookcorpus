Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames.

Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Cate's complexion had given her Amendyrri heritage away already, but the information that Sarah had told me about her family history was intriguing.
"Do you mean Dan'tari?"
The name was familiar.
"Yes, that's it.
But how did you know?"
I blushed.
"I like to read."
"Never mind," Sarah said, dismissing her surprise with a shake of her head.
"Not many people know.
Please, don't think any differently about her.
She sees things, and sometimes doesn't even remember afterwards, but if she does, she usually becomes ill.
If she looks at any of us like that, we don't talk about it."
The look Sarah gave me was threatening and protective, and immediately sobered me.
"No, of course not.
I would never think differently of Cate.
I promise to keep it a secret.
She is very dear to me."
I understood why Cate had kept her gift hidden from me.
After all, I was doing the same thing.
However, I was secretly relieved to learn I was not the only Ariada at Baxstresse.
I smiled at Sarah and she smiled back.
"Cate should be all right now," she said, turning to go back into the kitchen.
"Let's see her to bed."
***
The dream again, always the same...I was sitting by the fire in the library, my eyes resting shut.
I often dozed off in the library next to the red glow of the dying fire, but this time, there was someone else in the room with me.
I did not need to open my eyes to know who it was.
Her presence was familiar to me.
She came nearer and my breath caught in my chest, unwilling to release.
I was not surprised when a hand caressed my cheek.
A finger trailed down to catch under my chin, tilting it up.
Soft lips stroked my forehead, moving down to my eyelids, kissing them.
They fluttered open, leaving my gaze unfocused as a dizzying face drew close to mine.
Finally, mouths met, lip seeking lip.
Hard, white heat sparked along soft skin, burning flushed patches over my neck and shoulders.
I saw her face.
Her wet, full eyes.
"Beautiful," she said, "so beautiful."
Time passed too quickly, as though several minutes had been snipped out of the dream's fabric and the two edges had been stitched together again.
I did not know where we were.
Maybe a bed, maybe still in the library.
I only knew her.
She was above me, against me, in me.
That last was the most distracting.
I was full, stretched tight with her.
Wonderful.
She breathed nonsense words against my ear.
I had to shut my eyes against tears.
They came anyway, and she kissed them away.
"Open your eyes, sweet girl," she whispered.
I clutched her shoulders tighter.
"Your eyes, Ellie.
Let me see your eyes."
I opened them, only for a moment, threading our gazes together as she touched a small star of heat between my legs that made me sob and shake in her arms.
"Let go, lover.
Let go.
Let me catch you when you fall."
But when I opened my eyes, I was in Cate's arms, not Belladonna's.
She was stroking my hair, whispering different words than my dream lover.
I could not bury the disappointment I felt when I realized it had all been a dream.
I had not really been with Belladonna.
I forgot my sadness for a moment when I saw the concern in Cate's face.
"Ellie, are you all right?
You were screaming and crying.
Did you have a nightmare?"
"Yes," I panted, relieved that she had made up my excuse for me.
"A nightmare."
"You kept screaming Miss Belladonna's name."
My lips shook as I tried to speak, but no words came.
Cate was sympathetic, gently questioning me while rubbing between my shoulders.
"Was she hurting you in the dream?"
"No. Luciana was hurting me," I blurted out, grasping for a plausible excuse.
"Belle was trying to stop her.
I was screaming for help."
This was the second lie I had told my dear friend, and I regretted it.
I hated to deceive Cate, but one lie always turns into two, and two into a thousand.
I was getting better at it though, I realized sadly.
To my surprise, Cate looked relieved.
Her eyes flicked downward to the sheets tangled about my damp body.
"She tries to hide us when she can.
Belladonna, I mean.
I'm glad you don't think she's...like her sister."
Though it had taken several weeks of service at Baxstresse to teach me how to lie, I had always been good at reading people.
I knew that Cate was hiding something.
She clutched my wrist with her thin fingers, her mouth set in a stiff line, her brown eyes unfocused, panicked.
"What else, Cate?"
Without realizing, our roles had reversed themselves.
For the first time, I wondered why Cate had not stayed asleep.
Maybe I had screamed loud enough to wake her, but perhaps she had been struggling with her own nightmares when she heard me.
"Sometimes she...what Luciana does, but gentler," she said in a rush, not even able to put a name to the act.
"She doesn't hurt you."
I knew I should have been surprised, but mostly, I was jealous.
My Belle had been sleeping with the servants, but was afraid of asking me to her bed?
There had been references to it in her diary, vague though they were, but I had chosen not to believe them.
It was too painful to imagine Belle in someone else's arms.
"With you?"
was all I got out.
"No."
Cate looked slightly embarrassed at that admission, almost pained.
"She knows...she knows I don't want anyone to touch me.
I can't..."
I was not surprised.
In Cate's limited experience, physical love only meant pain.
I desperately hoped I would not share her fate if Luciana decided to give up on her bet.
Although Mam disagreed with me, I was still convinced I would kill myself.
I patted Cate's arm, prying her fingers away from my wrist to let the blood flow back into my hand.
"Gently, Cate...I know..."
"But Sarah and some of the others," she continued, ignoring me completely, "they're infatuated with her.
They say she's a dazzling lover.
I've thought about it, really thought about it, but I just can't..."
This confession had been pressing down on Cate's chest for a long time, and I forgot my jealousy to comfort her.
She hadn't been with Belladonna after all.
She wasn't a threat, and I scolded myself for thinking badly of her.
Cate was my friend.
Even if she had shared herself with Belle, I thought, could I begrudge her that small happiness?
But I was secretly glad that she hadn't found the courage.
"Do you feel like you have to?"
I asked.
"Maybe.
Most of them do.
I feel...strange.
Maybe something is wrong with me because I don't want to?"
"Everyone is different, Cate.
Some of them might want to forget with Belladonna, but that does not mean you have to.
Maybe after Luciana is gone, you will want to take a lover again.
Nothing is wrong with you."
There were several things wrong with Cate, but I would never tell her that until she was ready to hear it.
Not wanting to take a lover after years of abuse was nothing strange.
Cate fell into my arms and gave me a tight hug.
I could feel her warmth through our thin nightgowns, and I flinched.
The sweet stabs of pain below my stomach doubled.
I tried to put the dream in the back of my mind.
"Will you sleep next to me?"
I asked, threading my fingers with Cate's.
"Both of us seem to be upset."
Having a solid, warm body next to mine would be a trial, but I could feel Cate shaking against me, and I knew that she could use the comfort.
"All right."
Both of us settled next to each other and soon Cate slipped into an easy slumber, her breathing even and slow.
Sharing her fears with me had calmed her down, but my muscles were stretched tight enough to bring tears.
Why did it have to be Belle?
I thought.
Why not Cate, who is right next to me?
But as beautiful as Cate was, I did not burn for her.
No one could replace Belle in my thoughts.
When I closed my eyes and started to fade, I forgot it was Cate pressed against me and dreamed I was with Belle.
***
Talking with Sarah was probably unwise, but I needed to know how Belladonna felt about her.
Worry bled my heart dry, and I had to talk to someone before I shriveled away.
Belladonna had not mentioned taking lovers in her diary except in the briefest way, and I hoped that she had no real love for them.
Still, I had to be sure.
