LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.

Curt and Tobias ran towards the Baron.
But he moved his arms towards them and two flashes of light went towards them knocking them over.
Then Walter put himself in front of Hannah and the Baroness.
'Over my dead body you hideous freak,' he cried out at the Baron.
'Move or die old man,' said the Baron who then aimed his arms at Walter.
But before he could unleash his magic, he raised his hands in agony and screamed.
The person he had said he would not underestimate again had beaten him again.
But this time there would be no second chance.
Matthew had stabbed him in the back - with the Spear of Destiny!
The Baron, however, did not slump to the floor but his now empty robe did.
Whatever he had twisted himself into over the years disappeared in a flash of smoke in the air and was now gone.
The mood of the hall was one of shock and then relief.
Matthew dropped the Spear and fell down himself, exhausted by the physical and mental tension.
But he did not lose consciousness and could see that the Baroness was recovering.
He got up and went to her.
'Thank you, Matthew.
I lost myself a little there and without you my brother would have destroyed me with my own hate.'
Hannah then went to Matthew and hugged him.
He could not believe how happy he felt.
'I told you that you should listen to your dreams,' she said.
She then looked like she wanted Matthew to kiss her.
He did not hesitate.
This was one of the many things the Land had taught him: if you did what you wanted to at the time there would be no regrets later.
The crowd around them then began to cheer.
But Hannah and Matthew's embrace was interrupted by Curt, Tobias, and even Walter, who lifted up Matthew shouting 'Hail Matthew the Spearmaster, hero of our land!'
The whole crowd clapped and cheered him except Eustace, who was about to escape when he was tripped up by Martha.
Two of Curt's men then lifted him up and held him.
The crowd then quietened down as they remembered the body from the sack - of their previous Baron.
The Baroness was putting what was left of his body back in the sack.
She was in tears.
Some people rushed to help her and Hannah returned to comfort her.
A couple of Curt's men then took his body away and the Baroness's old servants who had fled the castle when the young Baron returned helped her away.
'I hope she will be ok.
She has suffered a lot,' said Matthew 'Time will heal her, youngster,' said Walter.
'She has the same good nature as her father and will be a good ruler.' 'Yes, that she will,' agreed Curt.
'But tonight we will both celebrate and mourn for the old Baron.' 'Where is Martha?' asked Matthew 'I wanted to speak to her.' 'Oh, don't worry.
She's around somewhere, Spearmaster,' mocked Hannah.
Matthew laughed.
Life was good.
How could he ever have thought it wasn't? he wondered briefly.
Chapter Twenty Eight That night everyone who could make it in the Land celebrated at the Castle.
Even the Baroness joined in a little.
Matthew drank lots of dark beer with the encouragement of Curt and Tobias; even old Johan was there.
Matthew also danced a lot with Hannah - Walter keeping a watch over both of them.
Matthew decided that this was not going to be the last party he attended, as he took in all the strange sounds and sights and enjoyed being drunk with his new friends - and girlfriend! he reminded himself.
The rest of the night went in a blur of pleasure.
As did the next couple of days, during which time, Hannah and Matthew were inseparable.
They visited all Hannah's favourite (and private) places in the Land, and Matthew felt too happy - with his first girlfriend.
They always left early and returned late with Walter chastising them a little for this.
Then on the second night, Tobias and Curt took them all on a tour of the local taverns, where Matthew discovered what it was like to feel a hero - a very drunk one at that.
He also experienced what it felt to be viewed positively by young, attractive girls who no longer giggled at him but laughed with him.
This, he noticed, Hannah did not like very much.
Then on the third morning, Matthew woke up next to Hannah in her bedroom back at the farm.
He just about remembered getting back from the last tavern on her grandfather's wagon.
Matthew had been very drunk.
It had been a crazy night, one which he knew he would never forget.
But for some reason he had a sinking feeling in his stomach, as he looked around him and could see the Spear on the floor with his two bags of magic tools.
Hannah then kissed him and got up.
He watched her while she got dressed - his first woman; it really was unbelievable.
He then got up himself and followed her down into the kitchen where Walter was making some food.
'Sit down, you two youngsters, and eat some lunch.
A soldier has been here today.
The Baroness wants to see you, Matthew,' said Walter looking a little sad.
'She says she wants to say goodbye.' 'Goodbye!' exclaimed Hannah as she looked at Matthew.
'He's only been here for a short time.'
Matthew looked at her, also confused.
Now he knew why he had felt down this morning; it wasn't just a hangover.
'I'll see her after lunch, I'm sure there's some misunderstanding' he said.
But Hannah would not stop.
'You cannot return,' she said.
'I feel something bad will happen to you if you do.
It doesn't matter about your world at the moment and you can return there anytime.'
Matthew tried to comfort her without success.
But she continued to plead with him to stay while they ate their food.
Then after having a wash, and getting ready, he left with Hannah to go to the Castle on the grandfather's wagon.
They did not speak much on the way there.
Hannah was in a sulk; Matthew was still suffering with his hangover and thinking of the reasons why he had to go home so suddenly, though he knew his parents would be missing him - as he was them.
Sometime later they went through the Castle gates with the soldiers more welcoming than before.
Hannah stayed with her grandfather in the courtyard while Matthew entered the Castle - she was too upset to join him.
A servant took him to the Baroness.
He attempted a bow but she said 'After what you've done, you of all people do not have to bow here, Matthew.'  'Come here,' she continued and hugged him.
'Thank you a hundred times for saving me and our Land.
You will always be remembered here.' 'What am I just a piece of history?'
Matthew asked.
'No, not just that, although that is no bad thing.
But you will have to return to your own world as soon as possible.
You cannot stay here forever.
For one thing you have a family in your world.
For another thing, you were brought here by magic, which means that you are not as we are.
If you stayed here you would quickly diminish until you died.
This is because the magic which keeps you here is losing its power all the time.
That necklace you wear with the leather bag has protected you from the worst of this, but it will not last forever,' she finished.
Matthew remembered Martha giving this to him on his second day in the Land.
But he was still uncertain about one thing.
'I don't understand.
Your family came here from my world and they obviously did not diminish.'  'It was only my ancestor, Baron Von Hugel, who was of your world, and he did not stay here, and merely visited from time to time, which cost him dearly in magic.
I'm sorry, Matthew, but you must return and the sooner the better for your health and Hannah.' 'Yes, we've become quite close.
I don't want to hurt her,' he said, though he was very hurt himself; it seemed that his life had not completely changed for the better.
'She'll get over it in time.
It isn't many girls who've had a hero as their boyfriend,' she said.
'Yes, I suppose you're right.
Anyway, I'm sorry about your father and I'm glad you are now in power.
In the short time I've known you I have realised that you are a very nice person and I know from my limited experience in my world that there are not many like that,' said Matthew 'But before I go I would like to say goodbye to Martha.
She helped me a lot and I think it's only right.' 'Yes, of course, I hope we will see more of her around the Castle now.
Please tell her that,' said the Baroness.
'Thank you, I will,' said Matthew.
'Goodbye, Baroness.
I've learnt a lot here.' 'Isn't there anything else?' asked the Baroness.
'Er, oh here's the Spear,' he said.
'No, no, no.
You must return that where you got it.
I was thinking more of the magic tools you were given.
They shouldn't really be used in your world, which long ago forgot about such things.' 'But how am I to return the Spear without them?' asked Matthew 'Oh, I'm sure you'll think of something,' the Baroness said as she took the magic items from him.
Matthew then rejoined Hannah and her grandfather and returned to the farm.
Curt and Tobias were waiting, both with hangovers as bad as him, thought Matthew.
'Sorry to see you go, lad,' said Curt.
'We could have used someone with your bravery and guile here.' 'Yes.
Sorry to have doubted you as well, Matthew,' said Tobias.
They and Johan then said they were proud to have known him and wished him well for the future.
Matthew shook their hands and that of Walter, who also gave him a surprising hug.
'Goodbye, young stranger, Matthew.
Please also forgive an old man for his doubts; it seems Martha is wise after all.'
Matthew and Hannah then left to see Martha.
They got there late afternoon.
Martha was in her usual place by the fire.
'I'm afraid, Hannah, that Matthew has to leave us, otherwise he will be dead within two weeks,' she said without any greeting.
Matthew then surprisingly felt a little better about going back, for he knew now he really did have no choice.
'Ok, I knew that,' said Hannah matter of factly.
It's just that I don't like it.' 'I just came to thank you and say goodbye,' said Matthew 'But I suppose you already knew that.' 'Nevertheless, the thought was a good one,' said Martha.
'But it is us who must thank you.
Without you, the Baron would still be oppressing us.
You have helped to give us our freedom.
But in doing this we have also given you something, I think.
You came here uncertain of who you are and of the world around you.
But now I think you understand these things better.' 'One thing I have learnt,' said Matthew 'is that it is difficult to say goodbye.'
He looked at Hannah.
'Well, there are some bad things we all have accept sometimes,' Martha said.
Martha then beckoned them over to the table, where she got them both a drink.
Hans the cat came over to Matthew and he stroked him.
They talked about how the Land would be better with the Baroness.
Martha then said, 'I don't want to seem unwelcoming but you had better leave soon.
You are both tired and it will be dark soon.'
Hannah and Matthew both got up.
Martha then hugged him.
She also looked him in the eye.
'Yes, you certainly have changed, Matthew.' 'Thanks for all your help.
I will always wear this in memory of you,' he said feeling the necklace she had given him for protection when he had first met her.
'It will provide some protection even in your world - another reason to keep it on,' said Martha.
'The final thing I will say to you is: beware of the red wagon.'
Matthew decided it was pointless trying to work out what she meant for now and decided he would think about it later.
