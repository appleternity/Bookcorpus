In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

She put her arms around me and whispered "I am so sorry.
When I heard what happened to you I cried.
But it's OK.
I have a plan."
I pulled back confused but Violet chimed in before I could get anything clarified.
"Don't I get a 'hello' anymore?"
she asked feigning hurt.
"Well you never visited me.
You've been back a nearly a year, and nothing!"
"It's amazing, how much you've grown."
Violet seemed in actual awe.
Myria moved towards her smiling.
"It has been a very long while.
I must have been like eight when I saw you last.
Aunt Violet."
Violet shuddered in mock horror from the reference.
"Seven actually little one."
Myria gave a fake death stare before they broke off the charade and embraced.
Myria placed her hands on the top of Violet's head.
"Whatever.
All I remember is how pretty you looked in red hair."
Myria's hands swept down Violet's hair and it changed to deep red.
Violet laughed and shook her head.
"Are you going to even pretend this is a serious situation?"
asked Cam.
As if on cue, Elias arrived.
He seemed breathless and had an aura around him of agitation.
"What's wrong?"
I asked.
"I hate the man.
He is one of the most irritating people I ever met!"
came the reply from Elias.
Elias spoke with utter menace in his voice.
I furrowed my brow but then Cassie arrived with Viktor in tow and it became clear what had happened.
Though I relaxed when seeing Viktor, Elias was far from calm about the situation.
With his skill at sensing peoples intentions and emotions I could only guess why.
Viktor dropped a medium chest at his feet.
"Hey!"
barked Myria at the treatment of her prized possession.
"What brings you here?"
Violet confronted Viktor moving to the forefront at meet him.
"I hear a man has to have a conscience."
he smirked back.
"You look great in red by the way."
Violet made a fake gag motion.
"He just turned up saying he wanted to help.
Saying Michael was looking for us."
Elias hissed.
He sounded less than convinced.
From over by the door, Cassie gave me a look I could recognise without a word and I made my way over to her, leaving the others to sort out what they needed to.
We exited in to what could have once been a well kept rose garden.
A few large stumps and stone edging were all that was left, shining in the moonlight, breaking the darkness.
I pulled her to me and kissed her, glad to feel her close.
She looked up at me with a delicious pout on her lips.
"What is it?"
I asked but Cassie was silent.
"My love!"
I urged.
"Cassandra!
What is it?."
She finally broke her silence.
"She had all this stuff on you Matt.
Something isn't right."
"What?"
I asked genuinely confused.
"We went to Myria's place to pick up the chest.
I opened the wrong one.
It has all these photos, a couple of your shirts.
Matt.
Something isn't right at all.
I can't trust her."
I was relieved.
I had thought something was actually wrong.
I took Cassie by the shoulders and tried to reassure her.
"She has a crush.
That's all...Relax."
"She may look like a child but she's powerful.
Don't underestimate her."
Cassie looked even more serious now.
"I won't."
I responded as Cassie clutched me.
"We should go back in." she ventured reluctantly.
"We should - before they start killing each other.
But things are getting cramped in there."
We walked towards the entrance in each other's arms.
"You don't seem surprised Viktor is here."
Cassie commented.
"I'm not really surprised at all.
He seems to like getting punished by Violet.
It's what Elias does next that's going to be really interesting."
When she smiled I felt like I eased her fears and already I was better grounded and more ready to see what came next.
Russell, Camille, Myria, Violet, Elias, Cassandra and myself.
What a clan we made I thought to myself when we ventured back inside and saw them all.
Violet and Cam had an arsenal of weaponry laid out on a lone stone makeshift bench made from fallen sandstone blocks.
Underneath a floor stone they had wrenched up, they had produced silver stakes, crossbows and three shotguns.
Violet was calibrating the crossbow, while Elias and Russell were prepping shotguns.
Cassie wandered over and took up a box with leather straps designed to hold a variety of weapons.
She secured a belt and a thigh strap and placed a couple of stakes and a long dagger in the holder.
I was in the thick of it immediately.
Cassie strapped me up, securing a blade to my calf under my jeans, and kitting me out with a belt that accommodated a gun, a hunting knife and room to spare.
From the retrieved box Myria proudly presented an array of tools, laying them out across the stone bench, while she ground several different herbs together with a pestle in her lap sitting cross-legged as usual on the floor.
I examined the items, among them being empty shotgun shells and glass orbs that looked just like Christmas tree baubles.
"Are those Christmas Tree baubles?"
I asked.
"Not anymore."
Myria smirked.
"No wonder Michael wanted you out of the way."
I observed at the adept way she had been arming herself against the Old Ones.
She gleamed back at me as though I had offered the highest praise.
Cassie purposefully came to stand close to me and Myria's glee faded.
"This will work?"
Cassie asked.
"Of course!"
Myria replied handing her mixture over to Russell who promptly shook the mix on to a sheet of paper and started filling shells with it.
She then took a separate bowl she had prepared and started pouring the contents through a funnel in to the top of the empty baubles.
She sealed them with candle wax, and held one out to me.
I took it cautiously and considered it carefully as Cam came to stand next to me, taking another orb like the one I held from Myria.
I shook the bauble to try and determine what the contents were.
"It's a mixture of ash, dragons blood (the herb of course), rock salt and silver shavings," Russell stated in answer to my silent question.
"Take it, throw it at them and as long as it is a direct hit, they will be out for a while."
"Then what?
What do we do with them once they are out?"
Cassie snapped.
This was a side of her I wasn't familiar with - jealous and irritable, staring Myria down.
In reaction, Myria gave a look that could vaporise you where you stood.
"We're all tense" Cam attempted to reason, "Why don't we just calm down."
As if in response to those very words, Elias' voice became raised and he and Viktor stood toe to toe in the spot they had been talking quietly in until then.
"Why don't you just go back and pay your respects to your boss.
That way I can take you out when we come for him.
Nice and clean."
Viktor overshadowed Elias who was yelling at him.
Violet went to Elias immediately, but he pushed her back, continuing to rant.
"And she's mine so keep your eyes off her."
Words he would shortly wish had never left his mouth.
Viktor smiled menacingly as though he knew what the response from Violet would be before she even opened her mouth.
Violet grabbed Elias by the collar.
"Am not yours, Elias.
I am not anyone's but my own.
Fool of a man."
She let him go and he dropped to the ground, stunned.
"I made you, I am your maker."
She crackled at him.
"I am not your property.
I have walked the earth over 800 years, and you are less than a year old.
Fear me, respect me.
Do not think you own me."
She stalked around him.
The rest of us watched in anticipation.
Clearly hurt and shaken Elias rose to his feet.
"Is that it then?"
