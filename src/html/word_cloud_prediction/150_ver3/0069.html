Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Stephen is quiet, there is a shyness about his silence this morning, his flickering eyes.
My eyes flicker away too, remembering the strange comfort of our bodies resting against each other last night while we danced, the music so startling after two weeks with little sound except the screech of sea birds and the high pitched, rhythmic beat of the halyards against the masts of the boats, wires singing against metal.
And then music and human voices singing sweet happy words taking over the night.
As we left, turning around and lifting our arms in greeting to the shadowed figures of our hosts under the dark apple trees, Stephen and I held hands, a couple, our feet crunching on the shale paths, our breathing audible and waving to that other couple, to Dominique and Jeremy who carried the small sleeping bundle of their child.
I'd never seen my parents dance, even as a child.
There had been one or two dinner parties when Helena and I were little and we'd crept out of bed, quiet as mice to spy on the grown ups.
Stifling giggles, pressed against the back of the sofa, we waited to hear or see something that would make us draw in our breath or widen our eyes at each other, but the excitement came from the secrecy of it all, the courage required to pinch a chocolate from a nearby bowl and make it back safely to our bedroom, rather than from the empty hum of adult voices.
Under our bedspreads we would force out giggles, muffle them with our hands although there was no one to hear, and share the chocolate, minty and disappointing as toothpaste.
There should have been music, there should have been dancing.
Maybe it had all been and passed and we'd missed it, back in the days of those old photographs when our mother had eyes like a cat's and an orange bikini.
"So, I'm presuming if there was music, that that old fool Ruby, really what sort of a name... didn't persist with the ludicrous idea of acting out that barbarian battle."
My mother helped herself carefully to the one spoon of sugar she had with her morning tea.
Delving precisely into the bowl and then giving the spoon a little shake so that the sugar lay level, another little shake, it must be exactly level, no curve of excess allowed and then into the tea, lightened with just a dribble of milk, a stir or two and the teaspoon placed with a little clink on the saucer.
The cups in the bungalow are an ugly beige, bought in cheap bulk load for all the cottages I suppose, but I'd seen my mother perform this same ritual with different cups over the distant stretch of my childhood and it wouldn't stop, she would do it every day for the rest of her life.
Delve, shake, shake, stir and clink.
That little clink, did my father hear it anymore, did it make him flinch, or had he shut his ears to the noise, drowning himself in a mass of newsprint.
I couldn't shut it out, it sounded now in my brain, a clink and a clink, punctuating my mother's voice.
And then a little sip of tea, the merest little slurp and the long swallow, the movement of her throat, swallowing her tea like medicine.
"Making a virtue of those barbarians, tenth century or not, slaughtering each other like animals.
Hacking each other's limbs off and what not.
Mind you he could easily have looked the part, that Ruby, did you see his manners, uncivilised.
I wouldn't have thought the Hubbards would have a guest like that, a friend of theirs, but you can never tell, so completely..."
"Uncivilised, "I finished for her, guessing at the word and she raised her eyes in surprise at my voice.
I held her look, examining her face.
The clinking sound in my brain had stopped, I was solid and focused.
"I would say it is uncivilised not to visit your daughter's flat, her first flat she chose and bought all on her own, not to visit it until she is dead and then to rummage through her things like a rat."
I think I can hear the sound of an intake of breath, a faint, "Lizzie!"
which would have come from Stephen, but I keep my eyes on my mother's pale face, pale even after two weeks of fresh air and so much sun, an unusual amount of sun.
"And did I ever tell you about Helena's driving, the way her foot hovered between brake and accelerator, twitching between the two, making up its mind and then suddenly laying itself flat down on the accelerator, taking a chance when it should have been the other, should have been the brake, to be safe."
"Lizzie, don't," Stephen's voice, stronger now, the scrape of a pushed back chair.
"Did you think, that that is what happened, that she laid her foot down flat, charging at death, just like those barbarians you despise, preferring that sudden thrill and oblivion to a life measured out like flattened teaspoons of sugar."
"How dare you."
My mother's voice shakes with anger, tight and cold, her head wobbles a little with controlled fury.
"She was my sister, and I was the one she called, not you.
She called me to talk and I am worse than you, worse, because I knew and I should have gone to see her..."
Last night, back late from a party with music and the comfort of close dancing bodies and hand holding, Stephen and I had tiptoed into the damp little bungalow, trying to be quiet, trying not to wake my parents as we felt our way through the dark, bumping against the ugly furniture and stifling giggles, feeling our way out of clothes and into bed, lying close.
And just before sleep, a real sleep, deep and dreamless, the kind I haven't had for so long, there was the scent and feel of skin and hair, and I remembered her, the beds we shared.
Remembered her now, my eyes locked to the outraged face of my mother who tells me, "You have no right..."
"You want to know what she spoke about, the last phone call?
She spoke about you, Dad, well rather she wanted me to tell her something, anything, about you.
You see she couldn't remember, couldn't remember anything about you except the newspapers and how you never looked at her.
I told her about the bike riding, you taught us to ride, up and down that road, I remember, but she didn't.
Up and down the road and I was frightened and she wasn't, do you remember, Dad?"
I'm still looking at my mother, her tight angry face, but I hear my father's voice, "Enough," he says, "enough," the dry croak of an underused voice, a squeaky wheel needing oil.
I turn my head slowly to look at him, newspaper allowed to fall to the table, collapsing a corner into his cup of tea, luke-warm now, he never does finish his cups, the dry paper sucking up the liquid, growing soggy.
My eyes travel up, up from the paper with its corner of damp and black print like marching ants, up to the direction of that strangled voice, his mouth open and dark as a hole and then his eyes.
They don't flicker and fall away, don't drop down to the paper, lying awkward and bent as a collapsed bird on the overly-bright oilcloth.
They look at me those eyes, straight at me, just like Helena wanted and they are old eyes, burnt out, hollowed out, painful eyes and I don't want to look at them.
"Enough, my girl."
My girl he calls me, my girl, and there is a horrible broken appeal in his voice, a crack of desperation.
He is claiming me for his own.
My father, the man with the dead end job, his train journeys and crosswords, and now not even that.
Retired, the years until he dies stretching out, to be spent with my mother and the memory of a dead daughter who he gave up on, who he couldn't even look in the eyes.
But he's staring at me, this empty bag of a man, the stuffing all trickled out and the horror that I feel in thinking that I could be like him, really his daughter, the kind who gives up, just lets it happen, no fight, turns to a bitter rage.
I want to spit things at him, say anything that would make me different from him, sever the connection.
Things I should have said long ago.
Then they might have made some difference.
If I had called him, rather than my mother, told him to visit Helena.
If I had called him after speaking to her and hearing that high girlish cry in her voice.
I could have said, "Helena has no memories of you, Dad.
You are just a blank to her."
There would have been a great deal of throat clearing I'm sure, but it would have given him a chance, a warning.
Too late now, things left unsaid for too long, and now it's too late.
The fabric of my father is so flimsy, it would be too easy to rip it to shreds with a few cruel words.
So I look at him and say nothing.
My eyes are the first to fall and flicker, back to my mother and her smouldering anger, so much easier to accept.
"Lizzie, this is monstrous," my mother's voice, its sharp edge a warning, to hold me off, keep me at bay.
"But I am monstrous, mother, worse than any of those barbarians.
They gave great roaring battle cries, well so I imagine, and wielded weapons to kill as many of the marauding enemy as they could.
And it seems to me there was a sudden spontaneous energy to it, bloody and murderous, a heated frenzy that burnt itself out in battle, whereas I, you know what I did, mother.
I lay on a table, a hospital table stretched out with my belly exposed..."
"Lizzie, stop," Stephen's voice, with an appeal I deafen myself to.
"My belly exposed while they prod with a needle, sense the right place and insert a needle while I lie there like some medieval witch, the fight all gone from her, having her devil's marks probed."
"Lizzie, it wasn't like that, it was all very precise, they used ultrasound so they could find the safest place, there was nothing medieval, the latest technology, they said..."
"Very clean, it was very clean and they smiled, they told me to relax, "Just relax, Mrs Wright," they kept repeating my name."
"Lizzie," "You know, those English, hacked down by Danes, at least they fought about it, killed a few enemies, added some blood to the gory mixture of dead and mud, but I just lay, just lay while they inserted the needle.
So macabre just to lie still and let them do that, and you watching Stephen, watching with your brow all wrinkled up like a spaniel's while that doctor aspirated the liquor, wasn't that what they called it, Stephen, weren't those the words they used for sucking up the liquid that kept our baby safe and floating."
"Just a little, Lizzie.
They just took a little to test."
"Yes, to test if our baby was a dud or not.
You see we couldn't be one hundred percent sure, there was doubt cast over her, and so we chose to take the risk."
"A small risk..."
"A risk, a one per cent risk."
And we're all quiet now, staring at the debris of breakfast, crusts of toast and cold cups of tea.
Over the remains, my mother speaks precisely.
"Well, I don't know what you think you're doing Lizzie, holding us all to ransom with your nasty words, your nasty thoughts.
Complaining about the choices you've made, were they right, were they wrong, well the thing is frankly, you're lucky to have them.
I didn't, women of my time didn't.
You got pregnant, and there you were, no choice in the matter, and there, Miss Lizzie, you were, and if it spoiled everything, there was nothing you could do about that.
Lumbered, you were lumbered."
So I turned then and left my lumbered mother, and my father with those sad old eyes that I didn't want to look at any more, and my husband, my husband, silent now, standing in the low-ceilinged room, with its cheap furniture and sweating walls.
Walked out of the front door, turning down one of those little shale paths running through the short yellow-green grass, burnt by sun and salt.
Walked away, quickly and evenly, feeling a breeze on my face, the still heat of yesterday gone now, great banks of cloud building with the bruised, heavy look of rain.
That day, the day I got home from the hospital, from my appointment with the youngish but best Dr Mason, handing over ten pounds to the taxi driver, fumbling with my purse and handing over the money, not wanting any change, not wanting to prolong the moment when yet another stranger could look at my exposed face, swollen and mottled with tears, could look and feel whatever they wished, pity, curiosity, or nothing much at all, my face laid open to them.
I retreated into my home, scurrying through the front door like a frightened rabbit into its burrow, down the narrow tunnel of my hallway, lightened by the yellow paint and the stripped and polished floorboards, but dark without electric light, even in the afternoon light, even now that spring was so nearly here.
Over the telephone my voice was small and pinched, nails into my palms, that old trick, to keep me steady, keep me distracted until I could speak to Stephen.
The secretary sounding formal, "He's in a meeting, is it urgent?"
"Yes, urgent," my voice rising, sounding not like my own.
"I'll connect you Mrs Wright."
And then Stephen, concerned, but a little formal, there must have been someone with him in his office, a client, an awkward situation.
But my voice shattered and rained down in little pieces and he said, "Lizzie, I'll be there as soon as I can."
And I curled up on our bed to wait.
Wouldn't be long now, five minutes for him to give some kind of explanation, then out to where he parks his car, a short walk along the pavement along that busy road with sandwich shops, a new bar, one we hadn't tried, so many new places in Cambridge now, spanking new and hopefully modern, but they don't last long, change hands and a new sign goes up or else they revert, revert to the comfortably shabby which bring in the crowds.
Stephen would press the button at the pedestrian crossing, wait impatiently for the lights, wanting to get to me, couldn't be more than fifteen minutes, maybe twenty, traffic, it was unpredictable and they were always working on the roads, tearing them up suddenly, laying pipes, widening pavements, causing disruption to the endless flow of slow-moving cars.
A half hour, maybe it would be a half hour before I heard the key in the door, and his footstep on those smooth boards, his highly polished black shoes walking firmly down the passage to find me.
Schoolboy shoes I call them, although no schoolboy ever kept his shoes so shiny, it's what clients expect Stephen says, but he does get a strange pleasure from polishing his shoes, his expression so intent, a faint pink glow of satisfaction.
So I wait, I wait, curled on my side on our bed with the Indian bedspread, my knees tucked up like a child, like a baby, foetal position they call it.
Inside me my baby kicks, not a baby yet, still a foetus, not yet viable.
I don't know what part of her knocks at the walls of my womb, does she use her hands or her feet?
I can feel hard bits, but don't know, don't know which limb, if it is blunted, unformed.
Rocker-like feet.
That was what one of the books said, rocker-like feet.
A half hour and he isn't here.
I stare down at the bedroom rug, an oriental rug we bought together just after we married, a converted barn shop hung all over with Persian rugs, the floors, the walls, draped over the rafters, a mass of jewel-like colours, changing that stark English barn into something exotic, almost decadent.
A quiet hush of knotted silk that made me want to take my shoes off and walk over them.
So hard to choose, to single out just one of them.
I think my mouth must have dropped open, because I remember Stephen's finger under my jaw, pushing it shut gently and smiling at me, so pleased.
And the patterns, some so detailed and intricate, little golden birds in a tree with some sort of fruit, glowing because of the light on the silk and others bold geometric colours, rougher in texture.
I couldn't choose, couldn't choose and we spent hours and were served tea, apple-scented in little glasses so we felt far away from England.
The one we took home at last, carefully rolled and gently placed in the car, was blue and red and green and gold with little shapes that looked like fantastical flowers, some exploding in little twisted tendrils reaching, but not quite touching the other shapes.
Still curled, I looked down at our rug that we had chosen so carefully and brought home as if it were something alive, a new pet.
Waiting for Stephen, not understanding how the time passed, how long it could take for his dark blue car to roll smoothly down the streets, I followed the patterns with my eyes, down all the little paths they took, losing myself and having to start again, in the centre of the flower and out again down all those little coloured twists and turns.
At last I heard him, the quick steps, hard and echoing on the wooden floor, we should get a rug, a rug for the hall, but it's so narrow and dark it would be a waste.
Footsteps and then he calls, "Lizzie, Lizzie..."
and comes to find me, walking silently now over our rug, carrying in his hand a bunch of daffodils, thick sap-filled stalks with long pale yellow blunted buds, only just beginning to open, jostling and bumping against each other as he moves towards me, his forehead rippled with concern.
Was it the flowers that made him take so long, was he pacing up that busy street looking for the kind of newsagent that kept a bucket of seasonal flowers outside along with the piles of newspapers?
Maybe a petrol station, maybe he was out of petrol.
I don't even like daffodils, not picked and in bunches.
They're for fields and gardens, clustering under trees, inside they open too quickly, shrivel round the edges and lose their freshness, and then their smell changes, something rank with a hint of cat urine.
While I had waited, curled on the bed, distracting myself with the patterns of a Persian rug, Stephen had searched for daffodils, buying flowers, buying some time perhaps to work out what to say to a wife with a blotchy face and swollen belly printed with a question mark.
What he said was "Lizzie, Lizzie," and bent over me, kneeling on our rug and curling over me so I could smell that particular smell of offices on his dark suit.
He put the daffodils in a glass of water on my bedside table where they leaned out at odd angles, their stems too long.
He plumped up my pillows and brought me hot chocolate in a mug and while I sipped it, perched himself awkwardly at the end of the bed, knees off to one side, body twisted round to me as he listened to me, the horrible wait, that doctor with his statistics and the nurses, calling me Liz, "what you going to do Liz?"
and then nowhere to go, "we need the room, Liz."
Stephen sighed and murmured, shook his head and rolled his forehead.
"Rest, he told me, you must rest.
It'll be alright."
And then he left me, "Sorry Lizzie, I have to go, difficult to put off, I'll be back early, soon as I can, you'll be alright, just rest and I'll be back soon, anything I can get you...?"
So I spent the rest of the afternoon there on the bed with the spring light coming through the window, but fading fast, so that the ivory walls of the room became grey.
I stared at the walls, at the rug, and the daffodils, awkwardly scattered in their glass.
It was only later that Stephen spoke about heads in the sand.
"We can't afford to hide our heads in the sand, Lizzie," his voice reasonable and sensible, but he was no longer looking me in the eye.
His gaze fell somewhere off to a corner of my face.
I imagined us, absurd as ostriches, our bodies curled as we buried our heads.
But I wasn't sure what we would be hiding from, all those statistics the doctor had given me, but he'd said the choice was mine and my choice was to do nothing, no more scans, no more checking.
My belly was large and round with my baby somersaulting and kicking, knocking to let me know she was there.
And her heart, fast as a galloping horse, how could it be, how could it, that she could be so twisted and malformed that she wouldn't have more than one or two months of life.
But, "Don't hide your head in the sand," Stephen tells me, "as Dr Mason said..."
"Dr Mason?
When did you speak to him?"
