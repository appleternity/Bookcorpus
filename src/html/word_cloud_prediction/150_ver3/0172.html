'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Disembarking', 'tfidf': 1.6664884090423584, 'lexical_unit': 'disembark.v / disembarkation.n / detrain.v', 'definition': "A Traveller leaves from or dismounts a Vehicle.

In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.

'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

"Well, no sense in worrying about it now.
Just play it by ear."
They finished up their shopping and were headed home in the car.
Valerie stopped talking about Alex, and Sarah didn't want to bring it up again.
She was flipping through a Cosmo when she got a text from Sofia that almost stopped her heart.
OMG, Romero walked in on me and Eric!
Can you talk?
Sarah bolted upright and hit the send button.
Sofia answered on the first ring.
"What happened?"
"I went over to pick up a DVD I wanted to borrow."
She giggled.
"Hold on."
Sarah waited, stunned.
For the life of her, she could not figure out how Sofia could find anything about this whole situation humorous.
From the first time Sofia had mentioned Eric kissing her, she could hardly contain herself.
Ever since, much to Sarah's horror, Sofia had filled her in on every stolen moment she and Eric had.
Each one got heavier than the last.
Sarah's heart was racing, and Sofia was giggling!
Sarah heard a door close then Sofia's voice again.
"Okay, I came outside.
Angel just got home.
Anyway, Eric was home alone but had just gotten out of the shower.
He only had a towel on, and we started making out."
She lowered her voice.
"Sarah, his towel came off, and I saw everything!"
Sarah was going to need smelling salts soon.
She fanned herself with the magazine.
Valerie glanced at her.
"You want the air on?"
Sarah shook her head.
"Then what?"
"I turned away.
He felt really bad, kept apologizing and asking if I was okay.
I was.
It just really took me by surprise.
But it was exciting."
She giggled again, unnerving Sarah to no end.
"Then we heard a knock on the door.
Romero didn't even wait.
He came right in.
I grabbed a DVD off the shelf and ran out of there."
Exciting?
Sarah fanned harder.
Valerie looked at her weird and turned the air on.
Sarah welcomed the cool air.
She was beginning to perspire.
"Did Romero say anything to you?"
"No, he just stood there speechless.
You think he'll say anything?"
"I don't know."
She honestly didn't.
This was out of control.
She wished she could tell Sofia to please not tell her anything more.
She didn't want to know.
It was bad enough she was already keeping something big from Angel.
She wasn't sure which was worse.
The thought made her shudder.
But she knew Sofia was all alone with this.
Sarah wasn't sure if she should feel sorry for her or admire her.
Sofia's world was full of overbearing cavemen.
But it didn't seem to slow her down.
"That's Eric on the other line!"
Sofia squealed.
"I'll call you back!"
There was a click, and the call ended.
Sarah put the phone down still completely stunned.
"What was that about?"
Valerie asked.
"Trust me.
You don't wanna know."
She was home by the time Sofia called her back.
Eric had been honest but told Romero as little as possible, and Romero promised he wouldn't say anything, but he thought Eric was incredibly stupid.
Sarah was relieved to hear it and glad she wasn't the only one now that knew.
But she still worried that Romero might get drunk and spill it somehow.
Tonight would be interesting.
Everyone would be there.
Chapter 18 As usual, Angel's heart raced at the sight of Sarah.
He kissed her as soon as she got in the car.
It was supposed to be a friendly hello kiss, but unable to restrain himself, he kissed her passionately until someone in the back seat cleared his throat.
Sarah pulled away immediately and turned around.
Romero, Eric, and Sofia were crammed in the backseat.
"I didn't see you guys."
Her scandalized expression when she saw them surprised him.
This wasn't the first time he was ravenous for her in front of them.
"My bad."
Angel smirked, pulling out of the driveway.
"I forgot anyone was back there."
"I was just talking to you before she got in the car, ass," Romero protested.
Angel chuckled, lacing his fingers into Sarah's and placing their hands together on his lap.
Sarah stared straight ahead, a bit too rigid.
He wasn't sure what to make of it.
He hoped she wasn't mad.
The ride to the bowling alley was a fairly quiet one, except for Romero protesting about the music.
Angel hit the off button to shut Romero up and glanced in the rearview mirror for his reaction.
What he saw was Sofia resting her head on Eric's shoulder.
"You tired, Sofie?"
She sat up immediately.
"No."
Angel glanced at the clock on the dash.
It was only eight.
"She falling asleep on you, Eric?"
Sarah shifted in her seat, brought his hand up to her lips, and kissed it.
He immediately forgot about Sofia and smiled instead.
He was glad she wasn't mad.
He had to remember even though he couldn't care less what anyone thought about the crazed way she made him feel, Sarah was a bit more modest.
When they got to the bowling alley, Angel took Sarah aside.
He put his arms around her waist and pulled her to him.
"You mad?"
Her confused expression relieved him.
"About what?"
"Nothing."
He kissed her, feeling kind of dumb.
"Never mind."
He should've known something like that wouldn't have made her mad.
Whatever it was, she was over it now.
She looked at him weird but didn't ask anything else.
There were a lot more people there than Angel had expected.
He knew Fridays were busy.
They turned the lights down and played music, but this crowd was huge.
Most of the guys from the team had showed up, and, apparently, Sarah and Sofia had invited the track team because there were a lot of them there as well.
Sarah and Sofia walked away to mingle with their friends from the track team.
Angel didn't mind.
He was still holding out hope her friends on the team would talk her into joining and she'd decide to stay.
There were only a few more weeks before she was leaving, and it killed him.
But he wouldn't dwell on that and ruin the night.
Romero handed him a soda and put his arm around his shoulder.
"Happy birthday, big guy."
Angel sipped through the straw cautiously.
He knew better.
Sure enough, it tasted like gasoline laced with some soda.
Angel coughed.
"What the fuck?"
Romero laughed and so did the other guys standing around him.
"It's your birthday, man.
Don't be a pussy!"
Someone always snuck in something to pour in the soda.
And he knew the guys were going to try to get him wasted because it was his birthday.
But he had other plans for later that night.
There was no way he was missing out on that.
These things were always the same.
Everyone was underage, so the only chance anyone had of getting a buzz was to sneak stuff in.
He was sure half the people there were packing.
Angel didn't even like hard liquor.
The only thing he'd ever go for was beer, and even then it was one or two at most.
But he didn't want to disappoint the guys, so he pretended to keep drinking.
He knew they were all drinking the same crap and, before long, no one would notice when he dumped it out.
They'd been there almost two hours, and Angel couldn't believe people were still arriving.
The place was almost too crowded.
Angel could tell Sarah was trying to give him his space with the guys.
