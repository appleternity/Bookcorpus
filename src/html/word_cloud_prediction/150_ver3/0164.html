This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically

She always said that they didn't argue.
They both had strong wills and just liked to have their point heard.
It was why she made such a great nurse; she could bend the will of the most difficult patients.
"I wasn't offering.
I'm taking her to school and that's final."
I could see the vacant look behind the charm.
Aiden knew damn well we had plenty of cars in the garage for me to choose from.
He was here to do damage control.
My birthday dinner was on a Friday, giving him the weekend to mull things over.
But since I had gotten sick and wasn't in school, we had no time to discuss our plan of attack.
As much as I hated it, it was a smart move...not that I'd ever tell him that.
"The McLaren only seats two people," I reminded him hoping to wipe the smirk of satisfaction from his perfect face.
"I'll be taking Summer to school today since you have early meetings this morning,"  Cadence happily chirped.
She just fed his satisfaction a full serving of Mega-Ego Boost Alpha 12.
I rolled my eyes as I shrugged on my blazer and walked past him and out the front door.
It would be pointless to argue with him any further.
My stepmother had been prepared to take his side no matter what.
Where was the sense of family loyalty?
I tried to maintain the dignity that I was brought up with.
I was a Moon--a descendent of African Queens and a member of one of the oldest wealthy black families in America.
I absolutely refused to act like a petulant child.
"You're pouting," Aiden pointed out with a laugh.
"So?"
He laughed again.
The steam built up in my head and threatened to leak from my ears.
You know that cartoon bull that's always pissed.
He started the car and sped off towards school.
"I did call you to try and give you a heads up this morning but your number's disconnected.
The news has already spread around school."
"Given all of the hate messages I got over the past few days that would be a severe understatement.
I had to change my number," I let him know, staring out the window.
I watched as we sped by all the sprawling properties and into town.
"Summer gave me your number before you came down."
He didn't attempt to apologize for the hate messages.
Why would he?
He would say that I deserved it for ruining his life.
"It's only going to get worse once we get to campus.
It was suggested by the higher ups that we go to school together; some archaic, fanciful notion of presenting a united front," he said bitterly--the sarcasm dripping from his lips.
"What an obedient boy," I mocked, but didn't chance staring at him.
I was a hypocrite and I refused to face his accusing stare.
Halfway through town, he cut up a side street that led out to the country roads.
"It's not like you have a choice in the matter either," he finally acknowledged.
"Just because you didn't arrange this doesn't mean your father isn't somehow responsible for this too."
And that was the sound of the other bitter stiletto dropping.
"Did you miss the part where this was supposed to be some plan cooked up by your grandmother?"
He swung onto the country road, surrounded by vast fields and picturesque mountains in the distance.
"Don't expect me to change just because we're engaged.
Taking you to the cotillion means nothing.
I am still the heir to the Wainwright fortune.
Socially, it makes sense to be your escort," he completely ignored my question, as usual.
I nodded, taking in the view.
The car was silent for a few moments before Aiden abruptly pulled over and parked the car.
I stared at him, wondering what he was thinking.
"You kicked me out of your room yesterday," he said evenly--clearly Aiden wasn't happy.
"As I recall, I told you both to take it outside, if you couldn't keep from pissing on my rug," I shrugged my shoulders, deciding to close my eyes and revel in the soft red leather.
"You called me an overrated gladiator."
"You were acting more like a pig."
"He didn't leave until late."
"That's called stalking.
Besides, Adric was there too."
"Summer volunteered that information."
"Talk about family loyalty."
"Now you know how I feel," he said quietly.
I opened an eye to stare at him again.
He sat back in his seat and dragged a hand through his inky curls.
He turned his heated gaze on me.
One hand trailed up my thigh and mini curls of pleasure shot up my leg and coiled in my center.
I closed my eyes and took in a deep breath.
"Things aren't going to change, just because we're getting married," his hand tightened beneath the hem of my skirt and my pulse jumped.
His words sunk in and I pushed his hand away tightening my grasp on reality.
"I didn't expect you to change at all," I said tightly.
Marriage wasn't taken lightly in our circles.
One would think that race would be an issue to.
But if you hadn't noticed yet, beyond breading, money is the one thing that transcends almost all of life's trivial obstacles.
Respect is earned in every direction as long as your paper trail is long enough.
However, the one thing money couldn't surpass were the sacred vows as old as time.
Of course, affairs came natural in a world with money as old as ours.
Keeping them a secret proved to be the hardest thing.
Aiden, I suspected, had no intention of keeping them secret--he didn't now, anyways.
We came to a quiet understanding and Aiden restarted the car and sped off towards school.
Every pair of early eyes at Abington turned on us as we pulled into the lot.
We made a quick stop at my locker then proceeded to our morning meetings, avoiding awkward stares and reciprocating even more awkward greetings.
I felt the sharp stares of every envious woman within a three mile radius pierce the skin in my back and twist slowly.
To his credit, Aiden hung closely, even occasionally participated in a few intimate touches, when the stares got too unbearable.
A few bold classmates stiffly congratulated us on our upcoming nuptials.
Following the meetings, he walked me to my locker before abandoning me for his friends and moving to their usual spot further down the hall.
It was still early, another half hour before the bell rang for opening period.
Remy strolled up with his easy gait and lazy grin.
"The new power couple stirring up trouble on the social scene, I see."
His grin spread wider across his lips.
"Sorry about the cotillion.
It appears it's out of my hands," I apologized lamely.
I pulled out a couple of folders and binders I would need for my classes.
I had qualified to opt out of my final exams and would be handing in my final projects today.
The work that Aiden brought me corrected the final corrections I had needed to make.
"Pas de quoi," he shrugged pushing off the lockers and winking at a couple of giggling girls that walked by.
He definitely wouldn't be hurting for my company that night.
"I'd had my eye on Clarette Douser for the past few days anyway."
"Just Clarette, or her twin brother as well?"
His grin grew wider.
Suddenly, my body propelled forward.
Remy's arms shot out to steady me.
I looked over my shoulder to find Lisa and her surgically enhanced groupies.
"I would apologize, but then that would be pointless," she laughed grating on my nerves and eardrums simultaneously.
I had to admit that she was the only person that could accomplish that feat.
I suppose that makes her rather talented.
"No need to be petty," Remy stepped in.
"Clearly, the better woman won."
She narrowed her eyes at Remy and her talons showed.
"Only because, apparently, he'd been tipping the cow," she cackled and her cronies joined in.
Such miserable birds deserved to be put out of their misery.....wait a minute, did that bitch just call me a cow?
"He didn't have to agree if he felt that strongly about it.
Besides, what does that say about the quality of your milk, dear?
Everyone knows he'd been sampling it for free for quite some time now.
Was there an offer on the table for more permanent delivery arrangements?"
Remy queried sarcastically.
GO REMY!!R-E-M-Y!!
GOOOOO REMY!
I cheered mentally.
Another reason I loved him so much is how great he was with words.
The way he waxed poetic was downright lyrical genius.
His sarcasm and flare for imagery were simply epic.
Lisa's mouth opened and closed in rapid succession like a fish on dry land gasping for air.
I didn't that tried hard to suppress the laughter bubbling in me.
"I'm sure he would have gotten around to it," insignificant groupie number one shot back, while insignificant groupie number two nodded dumbly.
"No, I wouldn't have," Aiden said as he walked by, slipping an arm around Lisa's tiny waist and dragging her way.
Her groupies struggled to catch up and blend in with his entourage.
He shot me a quick look that dared me to say anything to him.
We weren't married yet, so vows didn't apply.
We weren't even dating.
"I would commend him on his save, but I'm not quite sure who he was saving," Remy mused aloud as the hall buzzed with gossip and excitement over what just transpired.
"I already have a knight in shining armor," I smiled as I wrapped my arm around his.
He kissed the top of my head and we continued on to our first class.
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"Nothing in my shoe collection matches the uniforms of fast food fashion," I wrinkled my nose.
I got chills picturing my Jimmy Choo's stepping in fry cook's grease.
"Touche."
Chapter Eight May 31, 2003 Letta Leigh slipped the last pin in place securing the network of twists and braids at the back of my head.
Loose tendrils of hair framed my face.
Cadence finished the last application of lip gloss before stepping back and allowing me to see her work.
I smiled and thanked her and Letta Leigh.
Their eyes shone with fresh happy tears as they watched me in the mirror.
"I swear I'm blowing this joint if you two start crying," I warned them.
They laughed and wiped errant tears with their napkins.
"We had better get downstairs.
Your father and Andre are waiting for us."
Letta Leigh and Cadence hugged me quickly before exiting the room.
Layers of white lace, taffeta, and satin surrounded me as girls squealed and chatted animatedly while waiting for the signal to take the stairs.
Standing up, I pushed away from the vanity and straightened my white dress.
It was previously my mother's dress.
