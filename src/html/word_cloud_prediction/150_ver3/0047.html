There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.

In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'  'My life instantly changed from an empty life, to a life full of joy and purpose.'  'As you can see, the word WALK changed from red to green rather than have a separate lens for each colour.'  'My feet turned to stone.'  'The promise will turn to ashes if progress is not made.'  'The price  changed from $1.26 to $1.27 per pint. DNI'  'At least one relative instruction has changed in size from short to long.'  In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.  'The nation was crawling towards oblivion.' 'We were walking past almost reasonable and heading right for what-the-bleep.'

Most, but not all, LUs of this frame are usable in a context that implies a duty or responsibility, concepts related to the Being_obligated frame. However, our analysis is that such interpretations are due to contextual pragmatic strengthening--in other words, a duty is a frequently salient type of purpose that has negative consequences if not achieved."}, {'frame': 'Make_noise', 'tfidf': 0.5329996828899113, 'lexical_unit': 'screech.v / snicker.v / whinny.v', 'definition': "A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.  This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Measurable_attributes', 'tfidf': 0.532179369363643, 'lexical_unit': 'deep.a / light [weight].a / low.a', 'definition': "An Entity has a particular scalar Attribute with a value exceeding a contextually-specified or generally-understood standard.

The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically

With each minute that passed, he felt more and more relief.
"No, neither one of us dead.
What I meant was; I got hit with arrow."
"Where at?"
Thelton asked with concern.
The fire moved about their bodies in a rhythmic motion.
"In thigh."
Indy pointed at her thigh.
"Are you alright?"
"I am now."
"Good," he said.
There was silence for a moment.
More of his pain slipped away.
"I can't figure out where we are at or what is going on here."
Because he had lost so much blood, Thelton had lost sense with reality.
"We are at Firelake," Indy said.
"Firelake?
Firelake?"
He felt like he should know the word, but the idea of it still baffled him.
"You know what Firelake is?"
she said.
Thelton searched his brain until he found recollection.
Firelake!
Of course.
She had brought him here to save his life.
"Oh yeah!"
he said.
He remembered his mom.
Had she been real or had she been a dream.
He wondered if he was really at Firelake or if it was only a dream.
Indy closed her eyes and let the tranquility take her away.
"How did you know to rescue me?"
Thelton asked as he found more strength return.
"Your men called it destiny.
I don't know what means that.
I was with family and I missed you.
I wondered if you won war.
I decided to check.
I went to castle and found a battle going on.
There was killing everywhere.
I didn't like it and went to leave.
A man said he knew me.
He said he came over on the ship with us and saw you and I together.
He asked me if I wanted you.
I said yes.
Then we went looking for you.
He asked lots of men, until they finally helped me find you.
"When I reached you, you were on ground like you were dead.
I was scared.
I have seen dead before, and you looked it.
The men were wrapping material around your wounds.
Oh, they removed a few arrows too.
You screamed, and I knew you weren't dead.
They did lots of things to you.
Then someone asked me if I could fly.
I said yes.
They told me fly you to Firelake.
So I did, and here we are."
Thelton looked at Indy with much appreciation.
She had saved his life.
He smiled at the thought, then frowned "Did I want my life to be saved?"
he remembered how it felt to be with his mom.
"Indy should have let me die.
There is nothing in the lands compared to being with my mom.
Why hadn't Indy let me be?
If she hadn't interfered, I would be at peace, away from all the pain and hate."
At the moment, Thelton had conflicting feelings for Indy.
He was appreciative she saved his life, and he was angry she did.
He glared at her, but she didn't notice.
She had reclosed her eyes and had drifted into a better place.
Thelton hung to his anger as long as he could, but eventually the power of Firelake overcame his contention.
After several hours, the pain and anger was gone.
Thelton allowed himself to be completely consumed in peace and tranquility.
Chapter 26   Thelton and Indy spent three hours in the lake.
Their bodies had taken on rejuvenation and strength.
The only thing they had left to show for the war was the scars.
When they had finished healing, Indy flew them to the dragon camp.
It was strange for Thelton to return there.
He had been there two times before.
The first time he had entered the camp, he had come with the mission to kill Indy's mom, the queen dragon.
He would have too, if it hadn't been for Indy.
She had stopped him a split second before he had killed the queen.
The second time he had gone to the camp was to steal Indy away from Sterling.
He had felt so powerful at the time, sweeping in and taking her.
Now he was back at the camp.
As soon as Indy released Thelton from their flight, several of the male dragons came sniffing over to him.
She could see the hunger in their eyes.
Thelton could sense it as well.
Nervous, he quickly reached for his swords to attack, but they were gone.
"Imara, I don't think this is a good idea," he said using the name he had given Indy, swinging a stick in front of him.
He remembered how the dragons had chased after him.
Indy crouched down into fighting position between Thelton and the dragons while she spread her wings open to full span.
She growled and hissed as she paced back and forth in front of Thelton.
The dragons kept their distance, but they continued to circle around the two of them.
One of the dragons stepped too close, and Indy launched her long claws into his face.
She ripped away a flap of skin.
Although the dragon could have easily taken her, he stepped back, for she was family.
This display went on for a while, until slowly, each dragon walked away and went to another side of the camp.
Sweat poured down Indy's face and stung her eyes.
When all the dragons had retreated, she sat down, panting.
Thelton slid next to her, but he didn't let up his guard.
He held tightly to his stick.
Indy looked at Thelton and saw the color hadn't returned to his face.
"You were scared," she mocked.
She had rarely seen Thelton scared.
"No I wasn't, I could handle myself.
Don't forget, they call me the Dragon Slayer."
Indy's face turned sour.
"Don't you dare kill any of my family."
He remembered how sensitive she became when he had killed a dragon in front of her.
Thelton felt stupid for using his title in front of her.
Of course she wouldn't want to hear about all the dragons he had killed.
Having nothing else to say, they sat back to back, supporting each other in silence.
When night came, they went up into the tree house Sterling had built for Indy.
"Did you love him?"
Thelton asked as he examined the craftsmanship of the tree house.
He was very impressed by the quality of the work.
Sterling built it without any real tools.
He had done an impressive job.
"Did I love who?"
Indy asked.
"Did you love Sterling?"
Thelton asked as he spit out Sterling's name.
Thelton was playing games with her, and she didn't like it.
Of course she loved Sterling, just like she loved Thelton.
She decided to throw the game back at him.
"Did you love her?"
she asked, in reference to Princess Alashia.
Thelton got the hint, and let the subject go.
The two cuddled against each other for warmth and went to sleep.
Thelton slept all through the night and into the early morning.
It had been a long time since he had gotten such a good deep sleep.
When he woke up, he laid in the tree house, listening to the sounds of the Vegus Forest all around him.
Indy was gone.
Still tired, he drifted back to sleep.
When he awoke again, he could smell the savor of roasting meat.
It kind of smelt good, and horrifically stunk at the same time.
As he stretched, his joints creaked.
When he felt good and limber, he jumped out of the tree house and joined Indy by a fire she had built.
In the middle of the fire was a roasting troll.
Indy had learned from Thelton and Sterling how to roast an animal.
She could eat meat raw, and actually preferred it that way, but she had learned men liked to eat things cooked.
