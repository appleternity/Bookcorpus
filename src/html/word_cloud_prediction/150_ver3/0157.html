There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ?

'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.'

Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific.

About midday today, even though the tension between us was reduced greatly and there was a truce, it was still unofficial, we were not putting our trust in the Germans word completely.
So I was still given my turn of Sentry duty along with Rob.
Nothing was occurring, no bullets were being fired and no shells were launched.
No advancement was being made, until the turn of the morning.
Rob spotted them before me, well he does have eyes like an eagle so it didn't surprise me.
"Here they come" Rob said.
I responded to his acknowledgement by taking my binoculars and seeing for myself.
Rob was right and sure enough there may have been about twenty Germans advancing across no man's land.
This lack of enemy numbers already struck me as odd and every hunting instinct in my human body was telling me that this was not meant for attack.
I trusted my instincts and followed their message.
"Rob wait.
I don't think they're coming for a battle" I said.
"But they're Germans?"
Rob responded confused.
"Just wait" I said as I left my post.
"Thomas, where on earth are you going?
You're not meant to leave the post, under any circumstance remember!"
Rob shouted after me.
"I'm getting Sergeant P. Turner" I replied still walking forwards.
"Why?!"
Rob pressed.
I ignored him and quickly located Sergeant P. Turner who was having a cup of tea with Roger.
Needless to say as soon as they saw me a mixture of emotions flashed across their faces.
"Thomas?
What are you doing here?
Aren't you on sentry duty with Rob?"
Roger asked.
"I am but-" I said, as I was cut off by Sergeant P. Turner.
Sergeant P. Turner took the time to put his cup of tea on the table and then cleared his throat.
"Yes he is meant to be on sentry duty.
Private what the hell are you doing?"
Sergeant P. Turner pressed.
"Well I think you should.
Never mind, just come and you'll see for yourself" I replied.
I led the way to my post and they followed, Rob was still on duty but by the time we arrived back however he was not alone.
A group of men, including Paul, Timothy and Johnnie were surrounding the post and each were fighting over the binoculars to get a better look.
I knew what they had seen and why they were so curious.
"What the bloody hell is going on!
Is this war or a holiday resort?"
Sergeant P. Turner shouted.
The men turned when they heard his raised voice and slowly parted the way so Sergeant P. Turner, Roger and I could get back to the post.
As soon as we were there one of the men handed Sergeant P. Turner the binoculars.
I remembered what I had seen when I looked through the binoculars.
The Germans were not carrying guns but instead about three men were waving a white tissue as a sign of peace and the rest were strangely holding what appeared to be different items, almost like Christmas gifts.
The Germans were now no less than thirty feet from our trench and they stopped walking forwards.
Confirming my instincts Sergeant P. Turner ordered Rob, Paul, Roger, Timothy, Johnnie, myself and five other men who were standing nearby to come with him, but leave their guns behind.
Like the Germans, Rob gave Sergeant P. Turner his white handkerchief and the Sergeant waved it so they could see.
We stopped walking when we were about ten feet away and we could look the enemy straight in the eye.
The man in front of me was a short man, with light brown hair, olive skin and green eyes.
He was wounded and he had a bandage on his left elbow.
Sergeant P. Turner stepped forwards into the center and approached the tall man opposite him.
"What is this?"
Sergeant P. Turner said, ordering an explanation.
The tall man stepped forwards and responded to his question.
"Ein Geschenk" the German man responded nodding his head.
Confusion flowed across the men's face until I blurted out the translation.
"A present" I said out loud by mistake.
Without realising I had spoken the translation out loud, a line of heads turned their gaze in my direction.
"Since when do you speak German?"
Rob asked.
I had in fact learnt German when I was in prison for four years.
We had a cell mate who like us, had been caught for thievery.
His mother was German and over the years he taught me the language, I actually picked it up fairly quickly and I could now almost speak it fluently.
Not wanting to go into too much detail I simply replied "four years".
Which was of course my code for 'prison' and only Rob understood what I meant.
"Well I take it you can speak German then Thomas.
Please ask them what they are planning to do" Sergeant P. Turner ordered.
"Sergeant P. Turner hier, will wissen, was Sie woollen" I asked.
The British men were not the only ones taken slightly aback by the fact that a British man and a soldier at that, could speak the German language.
The tall man facing Sergeant P. Turner was the one to speak.
"Das sind Geschenke, dachten wir, Sie vielleicht einige Notwendigkeiten benotigen.
Wir uberrascht, dass du in Zahlen.
Tut mir leid dass" the man said.
After I had translated his words in my head I couldn't help but laugh.
It seemed the British are not the only people who possessed comical whit.
Sergeant P. Turner nudged my elbow and he wanted the translation.
"This man" I said cutting myself off, but before I asked my question the German man replied with his answer.
"Ich bin Friedrich" Friedrich said.
"Friedrich said these are gifts, we thought you might need some necessities.
We surprised you in numbers.
Sorry about that" I translated, which responded in a laugh from some of the men.
"Well um thank you?
But we don't have any gifts to give you.
Well unless you need a pair of wire cutters?"
Sergeant P. Turner replied.
Immediately I acted as the translator.
"Nun danke?
Aber wir haben noch keine Geschenke an dich uberraschen.
Nun, wenn Sie ein Paar Drahtschneider brauchen?"
I said.
The Germans laughed and Friedrich replied "egal, wie etwa ein Fussballspiel statt?
Wir hier Englisch sollen gut sein, dass?"
It was my turn to reply in a laugh then.
"Well what about a game of football then?
We hear you English are supposed to be good at that" I translated.
A few of the English mumbled in agreement.
"Well unless you're Thomas of course" Rob blurted out and I couldn't help but jokingly glare at him.
It is true, football or anything athletic to that extent is not my strong point, which is one of the reasons I'm so surprised I have lasted this long and been able to dodge so many near fatal bullets.
I guess my only athletic accolade is that I am a pretty decent swimmer and I can run fast, when I need to.
Still, miracles never cease to amaze me.
It seemed after some glances that everyone was willing to play a 'friendly' game of football.
Quite an unlikely situation and it was completely bizarre, but then again it was a way of showing the best qualities of humanity amongst the worst.
It was ironic.
Seeing as I was the only person who could speak both languages I became the referee, as well as the translator which is probably just as well.
The Germans handed us their gifts and we took them gratefully and put them to one side.
We used four of them to set out goal posts for both teams but one problem occurred to me.
Where were we going to find a football in no man's land?
I explained the situation to both teams.
"Just one problem.
Has anyone got a football?"
I asked.
When none of the English men answered I tried asking the Germans.
"Hat jemand einen Fussball?"
I said.
Again there was no immediate response from the Germans and the decision was eventually made for three soldiers on each side to wonder back to their trench, try to locate a football and then come back in ten minutes time.
However, Rob had a slightly less complicated idea and he turned towards the British trench where he met the eyes of a few hundred curious men.
"Does anyone have a football?!"
Rob shouted at the top of his lungs.
Sure enough his question was followed by the sound of shuffling feet and murmurs which was being carried through the air.
No more than two minutes had passed when a football that was almost falling apart, was thrown over the trenches and it rolled its way towards Rob.
He picked the football up and handed it to me.
"There you go Thomas.
Problem solved" Rob said.
I acknowledged to the Germans that we had found a football to use and seeing as the 'goal posts' had already been set up there had to be a disagreement about something.
The simple solution of course would be depending on what side of no man's land your trench was, that would be your goal, but the Germans were complaining that they would have the sun in their face.
After about five minutes of trying to communicate to both teams in both languages I was becoming restless.
"Come on now.
We don't want a war" Rob said which resulted in a laugh from our side.
The Germans wanted to know what had been said and one of them tapped me on my arm and so I translated it for them.
I pointed to Rob who smiled and waved when he heard his name.
"Mein Bruder, Rob sagte 'komm jetzt.
Wir wollen nicht einen Krieg'" I translated which made the Germans laugh too.
Both sides then listened to my instruction and the Germans accepted.
The next task was to flip a coin and decide who went first.
I did not have a coin on me but one of the German men did and he handed it to me.
"Danke" I said.
"Kopf oder Zahl?"
I asked the Germans.
"Kopf" they replied in unison.
They had chosen heads and I then asked the British team what they wanted.
"Heads" Sergeant P. Turner affirmed.
Typical absolutely typical.
Why could no one ever choose tails?
The funny thing about it was neither team, apart from myself had realised that they had both said the same thing.
"We could be here for a long time.
Too bad it's only one day of civilization" I mumbled quietly so no one else would hear.
Eventually I came to the decision that it was easier to lie to everyone, seeing as they would never know the difference anyway.
I let the Germans take the football first, simply because they did have a disadvantage with the sun, it was only fair.
Before the match, all of the men on both teams shook hands.
It was strange and in that very moment I felt as if I was watching one of the many football matches I saw in my childhood, played on the village green back in Little Hadford.
