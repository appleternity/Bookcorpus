The Source of the Electricity may also be expressed, or incorporated in the meaning of the LUs.  'A compound to generate wind electricity was built on the other side of those mountains.'  'China's hydroelectric dam is being built primarily for flood control and energy production.'"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 0.9340558883950605, 'lexical_unit': 'mighty.a / might.n / power.n', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

A Means  has been created or is used to allow the creator or a user to achieve a  Goal. The Goal is a state of the world that does not currently hold but which the Agent wants to realize and is planning and/or working towards. In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

His emotional control had vanished, and he was unable to prevent the stresses from bubbling over and destroying any chance of recovery.
Then he felt the negative emotions explode: Resentment, fury and with it, an overwhelming desire for retribution.
The power behind it overshadowed his weakness and appeared to be giving him an inner strength, much the same as it did during his fights with the Krelathans.
Only this time it was far more intense, more overpowering, and more energizing.
It felt as if the power within was waiting to burst out and consume whatever it contacted, but there was much more to it.
There was a sense of impenetrable darkness creeping up on him, a presence that was far stronger than the temptation induced by the dark realm.
It was a sinister and angry presence with hatred burning like fire.
There was nothing he could do to quench it.
Images of his father, his brother Ben and his close friend Hobbes appeared in his mind, making him realise just how much he missed them all.
Then he pictured Miranda standing by the lake holding her hand up to admire her ring.
As the memory filled his mind, he felt as if his spirit was being ripped asunder.
The pain was so intense he was barely able to stand.
Then the grief, pain, and anguish, transformed into an uncontrollable rage fuelled by the presence within.
The images of loved ones now dead faded away leaving a black hole of emptiness, a void in which he felt the fire of hatred and anger building stronger, expanding and fuelling the darkness and the presence.
It mattered not what he thought.
He was unable to prevent it.
A vacuum was beginning to form in his mind, one that was threatening to consume every ounce of his conscious thought.
'When will it all end?' he screamed in his mind.
He wanted to shout so loud, loud enough for the whole galaxy to hear of his pain, his anguish and his torment.
Inside his mind, he howled in grief for his loss.
It was a long and painful howl that threatened to tear his spirit apart, one that reverberated through the astral realm.
Inside the ruins of the building, Ellarna lay unconscious in the room on the basement level that contained the Qarakans, most of which were dead.
These animals used their power not only to hide from their intended prey, but also to hide themselves when injured or threatened, as they did now.
Ellarna, accompanied by Te'Endsa, was admiring some paintings in the gallery directly above the quarantine rooms when the explosion went off.
The floor collapsed and both women fell through, landing among rubble and the cages of the Qarakans.
Ellarna sustained the worst of the injuries and was fading quickly.
Unfortunately, they were lying within the animals' sphere of magical influence, and their presence was hidden from the sensory ability of any Guardian, including Grogaan.
The necklace Ellarna had been wearing was torn away as she fell through the floor.
The two green gems shattered as they hit the ground, and two flumes of smoke spiralled up from within the pieces.
They floated toward the ceiling and passed through the cracks between the chunks of rubble and out into the air.
Grogaan collapsed to his knees in front of what remained of the government building, which was nothing more than a large pile of rubble and twisted metal girders.
Tears ran down his dust covered cheeks and dripped onto his legs.
The intense rage that was continuing to grow within seemed to be consuming him, mind, body and soul.
He tried to control his emotions, to relax and let his magic flow through his aching body, but he failed miserably.
The sheer power and influence of the dark magic, coupled with the presence within, was too much for him to cope with.
He found he was unable to focus his thoughts on anything or anyone.
He wondered whether he could or would care about anything or anyone again, or even care about what happened to him.
Grogaan felt as he had done after Miranda's death: Broken, torn apart and alone.
Only this time it was more profound and debilitating.
Nobody noticed the two plumes of smoke rising from the rubble.
They travelled horizontally toward Grogaan and when they reached him, entered his body through his legs.
He was oblivious to the brief sharp pain caused as they pierced his skin.
Within a few moments, the four separated parts of the sorcerer's soul were reunited.
Temalleus Feringita was whole once more.
Immediately on unification, the sorcerer's spirit and conscience began to take control of Grogaan.
How this was possible was unknown even by those who discovered the process, and it was a mystery that would never be unravelled.
Grogaan jerked his head up feeling very strange and uncomfortable.
He felt as though something or someone was trying to gain control of his mind and his body.
His own conscience was being pushed farther back into the recesses of the mind.
He gradually began to lose all knowledge of who he was or what he was doing kneeling on the floor.
Everything became vague as if a thick impenetrable fog had descended into this mind.
As the spirit of the sorcerer gained more control over Grogaan, he felt the power and strength within grow to a level he had never experienced before.
It seemed as if his whole body was expanding to cater for the sheer intensity of that power, and he was unable to do anything to prevent it.
There was no resistance, no strength, and no will to fight off the invading presence.
His grief, anger, and the feeling of worthlessness had quashed his mental strength.
Although the grief and pain of his loss were still present, they were being pushed to the back of his mind by the ever-growing intensity of his anger, resentment and thirst for retribution.
The negative emotions continued building until it felt like a volcano waiting to erupt.
It was not long before any sense of peace and calm had vanished completely, replaced by rage and other extreme negative emotions.
Eventually, he was no longer able to feel the grief and pain that had once been so prevalent.
The sorcerer that now possessed him drew upon the power from the dark realm.
His renewed strength added to that of the Guardian's, made him stronger and more dangerous than any sorcerer in history.
Grogaan's own conscience and awareness was now simply a vague subconscious thought.
It had no effect on the actions or intentions of the possessing invader.
The possessor took hold of Grogaan's thirst for revenge upon the perpetrators of his fiancee's death, and would act to quench that thirst.
He knew this would intensify the emotional strength of the body he now possessed as well as his own ability to draw magical power.
With no more grief or sorrow evident in his mind, he stood purposefully and rested his clenched hands on his hips, rolled his head backward and laughed loudly and deeply.
It was a blood-curdling laugh empowered by magic that sent a shiver through all that heard it.
Women screamed in fright at the sound.
They ran from the area in panic, afraid of what he might do to those who crossed his path.
Governor La'Astor stared at Grogaan in utter shock and disbelief.
A Guardian had somehow transformed to one of the dark sorcerers in a matter of moments.
It was unbelievable.
Never had such a change happened so quickly.
He wondered whether this had something to do with those strange visitors from the Hebradon Empire, but then dismissed the notion as impossible.
The astonished Da'Aranban continued to watch the Guardian laugh.
His whole body was shaking from the power that was emanating from the man.
He backed off slowly, putting a greater distance between them.
He felt the hair on the nape of his neck begin to crawl sending more shivers through his body.
A sudden sense of fear swept through him as he saw the Guardian look in his direction.
Droplets of sweat trickled down his brow stinging his eyes, but he dared not wipe them away, dared not move a muscle just in case the sorcerer misinterpreted the movement and was provoked into doing something bad.
The Guardian ceased laughing, looked skyward and closed his eyes.
A light blue aura formed around him, and as he raised his arms blue lightning emanated from his fingertips, spreading outward in a wide arc.
The noise was deafening, and those that had strayed too close ran away covering their ears.
As he looked around, Grogaan noticed a small building to his left.
He felt a prompting telling him he should check it out.
He walked toward it and even though he sensed nobody inside, entered.
There was a small electronic device on the floor near the window.
Grogaan picked it up and looked at it carefully.
It was a remote-detonating device, which he believed had been used to trigger the explosion.
Grogaan closed his eyes and concentrated, allowing his magic to enhance his ability.
He sensed the presence of a man nearby, one who was worried because of his recent actions.
Keeping his mind focussed on the man, he walked toward the cantina wherein the man was hiding.
When he entered, an eerie and deathly silence fell over the gathered clientele.
The wave of fear he felt flowing across the room delighted him.
The man he sought was hiding in a small back room, fearing for his life.
Nobody attempted to question or stop Grogaan as he strode along the narrow corridor.
As he opened the door, he saw the man shaking with fear, and sensed the intensity of his anguish over what he had done.
Grogaan felt no sympathy for the one that cowered in fear before him.
Grabbing him by the collar, he lifted Hemstack off the ground and squeezed gently on his neck.
The man remained silent.
Grogaan drew more power from the dark realm and forced his quarry to reveal all that he needed to know through mental manipulation.
Satisfied with what he had learnt, the sorcerer released him, but then held him suspended in mid air with magic.
Terror was etched into the man's features, and droplets of perspiration streamed down his face.
Hemstack's body started quivering, his heart palpitated irregularly and he felt the pain sear his body as his heart strained under the pressure.
He wanted to cry out and explain that he had had no choice in doing what he had done, but his throat was being constricted to the point of suffocation.
As he headed for the door, the sorcerer propelled the man with great speed and force across the room.
There were loud cracking sounds as the man hit the wall.
The force of the impact was so great, bones shattered piercing flesh and vital organs.
The limp body of Hemstack fell to the ground in a crumpled heap.
With an evil laugh and a sinister smile, the Guardian become sorcerer left the cantina and went to locate his ship.
His first act of retribution was complete.
Chapter Twenty-One
Safkaari, Safkar System, Beraston Sector, Ladorran Quadrant
The reunification of the sorcerer's spirit was enough to cause a ripple in the fabric of the astral realm.
However, because Grogaan and the sorcerer were both formidable wizards, the sheer intensity of the power being united, turned that ripple into a powerful reverberation that was felt by other Guardians and wizards across the galaxy.
Sorann and Deanna were on Safkaari, the principle planet in the Safkar System, enjoying a few moments alone before being given a tour of the Imperial palace.
First, they heard the scream, an intense piercing scream that resounded in their subconscious.
Then a vision burst into their minds' eye, shocking them from their quiet contemplation.
Sorann knew instantly something terrible had occurred and that it involved Grogaan.
"What was that?"
asked Deanna, who was reeling from the shock.
Sorann looked at her, his face drawn in distress.
"What I feared most but hoped would never happen.
It was a vision of an event that has just transpired."
Deanna looked puzzled.
"I saw a man that looked very familiar."
Sorann sighed heavily.
"The one you saw was Grogaan.
It appears that he has been seduced by the power of the dark realm, but there is something about the intensity that doesn't make sense; it was too sudden, too violent."
"Remember how different he was after his return from Hiastora Two?
"I do, but surely that would not have caused such a rapid transformation in him?
There's more to it than that, something sinister.
I've a very bad feeling about it too."
Sorann's brow creased in thought.
"There was something else Grogaan had not told us about, something that posed a dilemma for him concerning his future.
The events are intricately linked somehow, but how and why?"
"And what was that scream?
I've never sensed anything like that before."
"I don't know.
I detected intense pain and grief in that scream, and no, I have never sensed anything like that either.
Something is definitely wrong."
Sorann took a deep breath, closed his eyes and tried to see into the future.
Nothing enlightening was revealed, but a vision that Sorann was not expecting did appear.
It was the same one that Grogaan himself had had so many times before, only it appeared very clear and revealed far more than Grogaan had told him.
It was of a man standing in the middle of a compound with his arms raised, and the blue lightning emanating from his fingertips flashed toward buildings and Imperial soldiers.
The vision sent a shiver through Sorann's body.
He had felt the power of magical lightning and never wanted to experience it again.
The pain was intense and indescribable.
"What have you seen?"
"A vision of the future I believe was the same Grogaan experienced.
