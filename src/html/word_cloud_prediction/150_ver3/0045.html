This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

The glow of torches zagged across their faces.
Ren'ai continued in measured breath preparing her mind for the day.
As she stood in the training room they called the arena, she looked up through the one place in the Jagged that she could at times see the sun.
The sky melted across wispy clouds cold and dark.
Not even a hint of Greater Sun peeked over the mountains.
Lieten brought her to attention with a hard slap on the back.
She fell a bit forward but stayed to her feet.
"Attack and Back."
Lieten spoke to her in a clear calm voice this lifted his voice.
"Defensive stance."
He pulled one hand up in front of his face and the other at his chest, fingers loosely curled.
Ren'ai followed.
"Ready?"
Ren'ai knew she could never be ready.
Never truly prepared to take the blows he had laid to her the day before.
She drew a slow measured breath and called to herself endurance.
"Ready."
She spoke through clinched teeth.
She wanted to close her eyes as her arms went hard.
If she did not see the hit coming maybe it would not hurt so badly.
But she could not; through watching his movement she would learn to take his strikes, eventually avoid them.
Afterall, he never hit her with joy filling loose cheeks, only with great duty thrust upon them.
She understood it.
She knew why she was here.
But Lieten did not strike her.
"Why do we fight?"
"To protect the Healer."
"Do you believe it, Nai?"
Lieten's glance showed uncertainty.
"I do."
"What does vengeance bring?"
"Destruction."
"To whom?"
Ren'ai fought to contain an escaping smile.
She reeled it in, but captured it too late as Lieten's staff came down upon her back.
She released a whimper.
"To whom?"
"To me.
To the avenger."
The girl cried out.
"To me."
He cast his staff aside.
Ren'ai sighed a relief before Lieten welcomed a metallic clang into the air.
Ren'ai stared for a moment at the new aggressor that had entered the room.
Not a staff but a sword rose before her.
"Do I get a weapon?"
Ren'ai thought it a good question to ask as he swung the weapon low as if preparing a strike.
"When you earn one."
"I can't fight against a sword with bare hands."
"A sword is only an extension of your hand, an extension of foot.
You must understand how to move your body, before you can make a weapon part of you.
Block it."
Lieten swung hard upon her.
She took a step back as the weapon shifted past her nose.
"Block."
The blade came up.
She hopped to the side, and curled around to the left of him.
He swung straight across and she ducked, the blade nipping at her already closely cut hair.
Snips drifted to the ground.
"Block."
He swooped around and came down on her as she took two steps back.
Had he gone mad?
What would she block with, her head?
She watched dark eyes, seeking answers.
Finding none.
"Block."
He brought the blade up between her legs.
She leapt before falling back on her behind as the blade continued in its path without slowing.
"What do you have against a sword?"
Lieten pulled the blade to his side.
"Nothing."
"Everything that is important."
He swung down on her as she stood to her feet.
"Except a sword or axe or something."
"Everything.
Speed.
Agility.
Timing.
Now block."
The blade moved past her face as she leaned back, then she leapt as he swiped hard past her legs.
A foot came down on the flat of the blade.
Lieten could not hold it.
It clanged to the ground.
Lieten bent, reaching for the hilt of his sword.
Ren'ai kicked him squarely in the chin.
His head swung back from the strength of it.
He stepped back, twisting his jaw between thumb and two fingers.
He smiled with blood racing down his chin.
Ren'ai pulled up the sword.
Now she had the weapon.
She swung at him.
He took a step back, and then his foot came up, kicking her hand behind the blade.
The metal banged across the rock, flipping and singing until it came to a stop.
They ran for it, with bare feet pounding against the rock.
He drew it up and again she found herself in a position to move and roll and dodge his strikes.
He thrust forward as the girl shifted to the side.
She curled her tummy in as the blade licked her skin, ripping through her shirt.
Again he thrust it out.
She hesitated as she anticipated the direction of his strike.
The blade sunk into her belly.
Ren'ai stood there a moment, watching dark eyes as they went from narrow to wide.
She wondered why he had stopped his advance.
In a swift jerk, he pulled the blade free.
She released a long gasp then bent forward as the pain deluged her being.
She looked up at him.
He called over his shoulder in a thunderous roar.
"Healer."
It echoed through the caverns.
It made her mind shake.
He turned to her.
Pulling his shirt up over his head, he reached his hands around her, urging her to sit as he tied it around her.
"Healer."
He called again, holding his hand to the wound, lending to it pressure.
Many faces rose around her, spinning and dancing as they were.
Some she knew, and some she did not.
At that moment they were all strangers.
"Out of my way."
She heard the Healer's voice.
The sea of onlookers parted as he came forward, ripping Lieten's well placed tourniquet from her, laying his hand to the wound.
She felt the warmth of his presence as the spinning room came to a halt around her.
Her insides felt as yarn upon a weaver's rack taking shape strand by strand.
Finally, she was whole.
Jabari pulled her to her feet.
She threw her arms around him and then released as he stood.
She peered through the tear in her garment at the scar left behind and she smiled before looking up to Lieten who met her questioning glare with the signal of a hand.
"You may go."
Ren'ai spared no time in making her way through the sea on onlookers.
She leapt past them as one with no blood lost though her garment told a different tale.
She left the training room, meeting the cold cavern hallway.
Her hand caressed cool rock and she ran, down the torch licked corridor, past the several sleeping quarters and waste chambers.
Finally, she stopped.
"I have my first scar, Niv."
Ren'ai bounded out of the dreary Jagged hallway and into Ren'iv's sleeping quarters bathed in cool light, draped in delicate pink tapestries.
A large bed lay against the wall, on the left a sturdy table, on the right a simple chair, upon it a strikingly content Ren'iv.
Only silence made her reply.
Ren'iv stared forward; not a glimmer of recognition pierced her eyes.
Ren'ai pulled up her shirt, calling Ren'iv to see that she spoke the truth.
Across her belly lay a beautifully straight line of raised flesh, all that remained to bear witness to having had Lieten's sword pierced through her.
She jerked her garment down again into place.
"Not very lady like, I know."
Ren'ai spoke the chastisement that she knew Big Sister could not.
Ren'ai took a hard seat upon the soft bed.
She sighed.
"It's only my first.
But will be many more.
Whatever it takes.
I'll do it.
Whatever it takes."
Ren'ai pulled a lifeless hand from Ren'iv's lap.
She moved as Little Sister moved her, no thought of her own.
