Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.'

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

I should have visited more.
I should have been around to help her when something as simple as dusting became too difficult.
"Mama, I'm so sorry.
You should have told me.
I would have come and helped you."
"Humph."
"I'm going to be here for a couple of days.
How about I help you clean this place up?"
"No, damn it.
I don't hear so much as one word from you all year and suddenly you show up at my door and tell me how to do things.
I'm the mother; I tell you how to run your life."
I rolled my eyes.
"Fine, Mama, how should I run my life?"
"You can start by getting rid of that loser boyfriend and marrying a doctor."
My fists clenched.
"For your information, Anthony and I are breaking up."
A tense moment of silence passed before my mother spoke.
"About time.
Now you can marry a good man."
"Anthony was a good man, Mom."
That was a lie, but I wouldn't give her the satisfaction.
"He could never take care of you, Ema.
He could hardly afford to help you pay the rent."
He didn't help pay the rent at all, but that was beside the point.
"I don't care about money, Mom.
I care about love."
"Yesterday, Laura told me her daughter got engaged to a bioengineer.
And Martha's daughter just had a baby.
Why can't you give me a grandchild?"
My jaw dropped.
"You want me to get pregnant so you can brag to your friends?"
"Yes."
I tossed my hands in the air.
"You're unbelievable."
"I'm old, Ema.
I want to see my grandchildren before I die."
"Stop being dramatic.
You're not that old, you're only forty-nine.
And I'm only twenty-three.
I'm not going out and having a baby for you."
"Can you at least find a nice doctor to take care of you after I'm gone?"
"Do you hear yourself?
You're not dying, Mama, you just need to get out of the house once in a while.
Get a hobby or something."
"I don't want a hobby.
I want a grandchild to spoil."
"Even if I had a baby, you'd be the last person allowed to see it."
I winced.
Mom gasped.
Whatever she said next would not be pretty.
"You ungrateful bitch.
After all I've done for you after your father left."
Great, here we go again.
I rolled my eyes while she went off on her usual rampage.
"You do this to me on purpose.
You still blame me for what your father did!"
A heavy sigh passed my lips.
"Mama, that was thirteen years ago.
You know I don't blame you for it, I never have."
"Yes you do.
You've been an ungrateful brat since the day he left."
"The only time I ever think of Dad is when you bring him up.
You're the one who needs to get over it, please."
At that, I turned on my heel and headed into my old room.
I made a mistake coming here.
I yanked on my coat and swung my backpack over my shoulder while heading to the front door.
"Where are you going?"
she called out.
"Away.
This is exactly why I don't visit you."
I jerked open the front door.
"Fine, leave me here to rot.
You are just like your father."
"At least I'm not like you!"
The door slammed shut.
Furious, I marched down the sidewalk, retracing steps I'd taken a hundred times in my youth, to the train station downtown.
* * * * 	The sun had set by the time I stepped off the train at the Union Station.
The few dollar bills in my pocket ruled out taking a taxi home.
I considered calling Anthony for a ride, but dismissed the idea.
I doubted seeing him right now would do any good.
My fingers gripped the straps of my backpack and hauled the load onto my stiff back.
A disappointed sigh passed through my lips as I exited the station and began my walk home.
Piercing wind roared through the streets, whipping my hair and clothes against my face.
Looming granite buildings cast deep rectangular shadows in a pattern across the sidewalks.
My stomach twisted in knots at all the alleys cloaked in pitch-black darkness.
Were there always so many?
A shiver rolled through my spine followed by goose bumps raising the hairs along my neck.
I swallowed my nerves and reminded myself the cops were looking for him.
They might have caught him already, but as I pressed on, my steps became shaky.
Something didn't feel right.
I paused under the dim glow of a street lamp and glanced around.
A tall, hourglass-figured woman materialized from the dark.
She took a long, calculated step to the side, positioning herself in front of me.
She cocked her chin and sneered.
I swallowed the lump thickening in my throat as my pulse sped.
Her pale skin and deep green eyes matched my attacker's.
Her lips curled, flashing a set of pointed teeth.
Beads of sweat dampened my brow.
Suddenly, I was running.
She laughed.
Her voice carried like a bell.
"You shall not escape this time."
I glanced over my shoulder.
She pointed a long fingernail at me, but she didn't follow.
If she hadn't looked so much like her male counterpart, I might have slowed.
Instead, I ran all the way home.
I paused in front of the main door and shifted my backpack forward so I could dig for the spare key.
Something solid smacked against my side.
I fell over, my head hit pavement.
The thing landed on my leg.
Muscle tore and bone snapped.
Agonizing pain shot through my leg.
A scream erupted from my lungs as I tried to push the thing off.
The black mass unfolded itself and then stood.
The woman shimmered into vision, grinning in triumph.
I couldn't believe it.
The speed and force it must have required to catch up didn't connect with her supermodel poise.
I tried to stand, but collapsed under the pain.
My lower leg lay at an odd angle.
Blood soaked through my jeans at a rate that sent bile rising to my throat.
The woman trembled.
She clenched her hands while gritting her fang-like teeth.
I followed the direction of her eyes; she stared at the small pool of bright red blood on the pavement.
She took half a step back, and then crouched, like a lioness ready to pounce.
I tried to crawl away, but could only pull myself a few inches before the pain became unbearable.
Tears dampened my cheeks while I tried to think of what to do.
A ferocious growl rolled passed her fanged teeth.
She lunged at me; her arms stretched forward, fingers arched like claws.
My mind froze.
Instinct wrapped my arms over my face for useless protection.
She landed on my stomach; her weight knocked the wind out of my lungs.
Another sub-human growl came from behind as a second shadow lurched forward.
It knocked the woman off me.
Growls and hisses filled the night.
I couldn't see any of it as I laid flat on my back in a daze.
My lungs worked desperately to suck in air.
After a few minutes, I managed to sit up.
Several feet in front of me, the woman sat hunched and licked at a wound on her arm.
The same man who attacked me last night stood next to her, panting.
He faced me, his eyes as bright as ever, and then closed the gap between us in three long strides.
My heart leaped into my throat.
"No, leave me alone!"
He grabbed my shoulders with both hands and dragged me across the parking lot.
I screamed as my back scraped against the frozen ground.
My right leg dragged like meat on a string.
The pain shot through my entire body, burning me from the inside out.
My attacker pulled me into an alley.
The woman followed, but kept her distance.
At the end of the passageway, he uttered something in a foreign language and nodded at the brick wall.
Glaring, the woman stepped around so that her back faced the wall.
