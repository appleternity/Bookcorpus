Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

Well, that wasn't true.
She wanted to do it again, but just not in the shower.
"So," Lucian hedged, sitting down across from her.
"Do you still think I am crazy?"
"I never said you were crazy."
"Yeah, I know.
But you thought it, didn't you?"
Yes!
She wanted to say, but didn't.
"No.
Not really."
He lifted his brow.
"Come on, you can tell me the truth."
"It does or did, sound crazy but what do I know.
If you asked me a month ago that I would have seen a ghost, a skeleton, or a bag of emeralds in a cave..."
or that I would have met you, she thought.
"I would have said you were crazy, but I did see them, so..."
"Hmm," he mused.
Setting his glass down on the table, he stared down at the carpet.
"Do you really think that was your father?
In the picture, I mean?"
"I don't have a clue.
But it is strange, the uncanny resemblance, right?"
"Well, yeah, it's strange.
And that ghost of Rebecca thinking you were someone else is pretty strange too."
"But do you believe me?
About my father, I mean?"
Molly chose her words carefully.
"I believe that you believe the man in the picture could be your long-lost father."
His brows creased.
Molly felt bad that her answer wasn't what he wanted to hear.
But what was she going to say to that?
That she really believed his father had traveled to the past?
She didn't, not really.
Even though, there was a small part of her that wondered...
He scrubbed his hands over his face and then dropped them back in his lap.
"I guess we won't ever know."
He looked sad.
"Who knows," she said, trying to cheer him up.
"Stranger things have happened."
His eyes lit up.
"Do you really think so?"
"Sure.
Why not."
Why not, indeed.
CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE
The Hotel, Little Switzerland
"Wait?"
Peggy said.
"You mean to tell me that cockamamie story we were told, was actually true?"
"Yes."
"I don't believe it."
"It's true.
I swear."
Peggy's voice was doubtful on the other end of the phone.
"How much did you drink?"
"A lot, but I swear it's true.
I even saw her ghost."
"Yeah, okay," Peggy sounded doubtful.
"But you don't have the emeralds?"
"Nope."
Molly smiled at Lucian across the room.
"Let me see if I got this straight.
You mean to tell me the supposed ghost took them back?"
"It would seem so but who knows, maybe they weren't even there to begin with.
Or maybe they are still buried.
I don't' know."
"What about the skeleton.
Are you going to tell your dad?"
"Of course.
But I can't right now."
"Why not?"
she asked and then added, "Oh, you don't want Lucian to know your dad owns the mine."
"Well, yeah."
"Molly," Peggy reprimanded.
"You are going to have to tell him at some point."
"I know that," Molly snapped at her friend not meaning to.
"Hey, I am just watching out for you."
Sighing, Molly cradled the phone closer to her ear.
"I know."
"You will tell him though, right?"
"Yes.
I promise."
"Well," Peggy exhaled.
"Since I can't see your face I will give you the benefit of the doubt, for now, but when I get back, I expect to hear you told him.
Got it?"
"Got it."
"I better go or Marshall is going to end passing out from heat exhaustion in the hot tub before I get in." Molly laughed.
"Wouldn't want that to happen."
"I know, right."
She laughed.
"When are you getting back?"
"I don't know.
We were going to come back tomorrow but Marshall wanted to wait until next week."
"Oh."
"Why?"
Peggy asked.
Molly didn't answer right away.
"Are you still there?"
"Yeah.
I just remembered something," Molly said.
"What?"
"Didn't Dan tell you Tracy left?"
"Yeah, that's what he said.
Why?"
"Not sure but I saw Dan this morning with Tracy."
"Did he see you?"
"God, no!
I hid behind a potted plant until he left."
Peggy didn't laugh like she thought she would.
"Don't you think it's weird they were together?"
"That is what's weird," Peggy said.
"When Marshall spoke to Dan he said she left.
So, if she left with Dan today, where was she all that time?"
"Got me."
"You don't think she was with Lucian, do you?"
Peggy voiced Molly's biggest fear.
"No.
No," she repeated louder this time.
"He was passed out."
"Yeah.
I guess," again, Peggy sounded doubtful.
"It doesn't matter.
They deserve each other," Molly said.
"Yeah, they do," Peggy agreed.
"Any way, got to run.
See you soon.
Tell Lucian I said hi.
Kisses."
"Yeah, I will.
Kisses."
Molly hung up her phone.
She set her phone on the table, walked to the bed.
"Peggy say's hi."
"Did you tell her I said hi?"
"Yep.
I sure did."
"Is she having fun?"
"Yes.
Very much."
Molly sat down on the edge of the bed and frowned.
"What's wrong?"
"I was just wondering about something."
"What might that be?"
His brow hitched up.
"I saw Dan and Tracy checking out this morning but Peggy said when Marshall talked to him the night of the wedding, he said she had already left."
Lucian visibly tensed.
"Yeah, so?"
"Well, I was wondering how she got in the room.
Dan was pretty wasted."
