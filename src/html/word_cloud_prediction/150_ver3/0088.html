This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Nikki could tell it was Chilly.
Nikki sprang up and ran to the door to open it.
When she pulled it open, there was no one there.
"Huh?"
she said.
Mike said, "They like to surprise us."
"Oh," Nikki said, shrugging.
This time, Mike led the group down a short tunnel lined with bees' nests.
The buzzing insects swirled around them, but didn't touch or sting them.
Samantha said it was called the honeycomb tunnel and that the bees were not dangerous.
Nikki was glad to hear it.
She had been stung twice and she hated the way her skin puffed up!
After the honeycomb tunnel was the diamond tunnel.
Brilliant diamonds of all shapes and sizes sparkled on the walls and ceiling.
Nikki didn't know much about diamonds, but knew that they had to be worth lots of money.
A lot more money than she had in her piggy bank, that's for sure.
They reached The Lab, and Mike turned around and said to Nikki, "Want to do the honors?"
Excitedly, Nikki reached for the door and pulled.
Nothing happened.
She pulled harder, straining against whatever force was holding the door closed.
Thinking the door must require a push rather than a pull, Nikki leaned on it with both hands.
Still no movement.
It wouldn't budge.
"I think it's locked," Nikki said.
Samantha smiled at her.
She looked at Mike--he was smiling too.
In her peripheral vision she could see Freddy's lip curled into a grin.
Then she heard familiar humming further down the hall.
Humming she had heard many times before.
Spencer!
Her friend came around the bend and into view.
He was humming to himself, the way he always did when he was thinking.
"Need some help?"
he asked Nikki.
Nikki shrugged.
"Door's locked, so unless you have the key ..."
Nikki said.
"It's not locked," Spencer said.
"Watch and learn, amigo."
Spencer raised his hand and Nikki noticed he was holding a canister of some sort.
It looked like air freshener or bug spray or something.
With a puff of awful-smelling fumes, he sprayed all around the doorframe, being careful to get into all of the cracks.
Finished, he motioned to Nikki to try the door again.
She sighed, not wanting to look stupid again when she couldn't open a simple door.
How could spraying the door with stinky gas help to open it?
Gripping the handle firmly, she pulled as hard as she could and was shocked when her arm shot back and the door flew open.
She almost fell over when the door collided with her hip, but Samantha was there to steady her.
"What the heck!"
she said.
"It was a trick, right?
Someone unlocked it right before I opened it, didn't they?"
"Guess again, Tickle-Me-Nikki," Spencer said.
"You have just witnessed the first thing I wanted to show you.
I call it Sticky Situation Glue.
I used it to seal the door.
That's why you couldn't open it.
The spray is the antidote, so to speak.
It reverses the stickiness."
Chilly and Dexter popped out from behind a giant silver pot that had steam coming from its lid.
"Surprise!"
they said to together.
Then Chilly said, "The glue is Spencer's first invention.
He came up with the idea on his own, and me and Dex helped him to create it and the spray."
Nikki turned to look at Spencer.
He was beaming proudly.
"What do you think?"
he said.
"It's amazing, Spence.
I wouldn't have any idea how to create anything, much less super-sticky glue!
It should come in handy against the villains."
"That's what sidekicks are for!
Cockadoodledoo!"
Spencer yelled.
"What's in the cauldron?"
Nikki asked, pointing to the steaming pot.
Chilly laughed.
"You make it sound like we are witches brewing up potions!"
Nikki giggled as she pictured Spencer wearing a pointy, black hat, chanting strange words as he stirred a boiling pot of bat wings, salamander tails, and hair from a unicorn's tail.
Spencer said, "The 'cauldron', as you put it, contains a big batch of Sticky Situation Glue.
We'll give you a bottle of it to put in your utility belt, along with the spray."
"Utility belt?"
Nikki said.
"Yeah," Spencer said.
"All the other power kids wear them, right guys?"
Samantha, Freddy and Mike all nodded.
"Strapped to your belt will be all the gadgets that I make for you to help you fight the bad guys."
"Cool!"
Nikki exclaimed.
Suddenly, she was anxious to see what else Spencer had cooked up for her.
"What else do you have so far?"
Spencer pumped his fist.
"I was hoping you would ask that!"
He reached in his pocket and extracted a smooth object.
It was about the size of an egg and shaped like one, too.
The only difference was that it was green and had a hoop sticking off of one of the ends.
Nikki's eyes widened as she realized what it looked like.
"Is that a....grenade?"
she asked.
Instead of answering, to Nikki's horror, he stuck a finger through the hoop and pulled the pin out and yelled, "Fire in the hole!"
and then dropped the grenade.
Nikki knew it was too late to run, so instead she just watched the grenade clank off the floor and bounce twice before settling at their feet.
While she waited to be blown to bits she wondered why Spencer had done it.
Then the grenade exploded.
It flared brightly for a moment and began spouting green and red and yellow mist from one end.
It swirled around her ankles, up her torso, and finally around her head.
Soon she couldn't see anything as the colorful gas covered the entire room.
Reaching her arms in front of her like a zombie, she tried to find the door.
"Ouch!"
she exclaimed when she bumped into someone.
She heard scuffling in at least four different directions as the power kids and their sidekicks tried to find the door.
She heard Chilly's exuberant voice say, "Got it!"
and then a felt a whoosh of fresh air across her face.
The mist was still heavy, but was not as thick as before.
Nikki thought she could make out the outline of the door.
She moved toward it and then broke through the fog, out of The Lab and into the tunnel.
She could see again.
Chilly was already out there, but Nikki was the second.
Behind her, Spencer galloped out, laughing hard.
The rest of the kids followed shortly after.
Soon they were all laughing.
Nikki said, "You scared me, Spence!
I thought you were going to blow us all up!"
Still grinning, Spencer said, "Now why would I do that, Cowgirl!
Don't you trust me?"
Nikki felt silly.
Of course she trusted him.
She had known him her whole life.
She said, "Of course I do, Spence, but after what happened with the Weebles last night..."
Spencer chuckled.
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that!"
They all laughed again.
They all had a case of the giggles.
"What was that stuff, laughing gas?"
Nikki asked.
"No," Spencer said.
"Just a colorful smokescreen.
I call it Rainbow Fog.
I don't know why we are all laughing."
"Cool, we can definitely use Rainbow Fog against Jimmy and his friends."
"I have one more gadget to show you," Spencer said, "but we will need to wait for the Rainbow Fog to go away before we can use The Lab." Dexter said, "No problem, watch this."
The short Asian boy reached up and pressed a button on the wall outside of the room.
Nikki hadn't noticed it before.
There was a loud whoosh! and the colorful mist in The Lab began to clear.
It was like a huge vacuum had sucked it all up.
"Great!"
Spencer exclaimed.
"Let's go!
Wakka wakka!"
He led them back into the room.
Once inside, he said, "I've saved the best for last, Nikki.
