This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

'' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Spelling_and_pronouncing', 'tfidf': 0.5290894524669181, 'lexical_unit': 'say.v / misspell.v / write.v', 'definition': 'A Speaker realizes a Sign, usually a linguistic one, in some Formal_realization.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

You might want to consider that before you throw away what he's offering."
Throw away what he's offering?
What was he offering?
Fallon was so taken aback, she was speechless.
"Just hear him out, Fallon.
Give him a chance."
"I have to go, Alexa."
Fallon said finding her voice.
"Okay, okay.
I'll call you later."
Fallon hung up the phone and decided her day was truly screwed.
Her head was starting to pound and she clearly wasn't going to get anything done.
Some days it didn't pay to get up in the morning.
She shut everything down, told Linda to call if she needed anything, and went home.
When she got home, she headed straight for the freezer and pulled out her animal cookie ice cream.
Too bad she didn't know how to mix drinks, she'd have made herself some sort of vodka drink.
Where was Shelton when she needed him?
On second thought, never mind.
After polishing off the rest of the ice cream, Fallon decided a cleaning frenzy was what she needed.
She hadn't been home to do the dusting, mopping, or other things she reserved for the weekends.
She'd just finished the vacuuming and was dusting the living room when there was a knock on her door.
She walked over and stuck her eye to the peephole only to see Reid standing there.
"What are you doing here?"
she asked after wrenching the door open in surprise.
"I called your office and Linda said you'd left for the day.
I came by to see if you were here, and if we could talk."
Fallon wasn't angry anymore, just tired.
And Reid was standing there looking like a lost puppy.
She stepped back to let him in.
He cautiously stepped across her threshold, and she quietly closed the door behind him.
"I'm sorry, Fallon."
The words tumbled out of him the moment she turned to face him.
"I'm really sorry.
I had no right to burst in here like that.
I just thought..."
He trailed off, looking at her with a hint of pleading in his eyes.
"I know what you thought," Fallon said without heat.
"And, I guess I could understand, considering how it seemed."
Some of the chagrin left his face, and hope lit his eyes.
"So, does this mean you aren't mad at me anymore?"
"No.
I'm not mad.
I'm not sure I was ever simply mad, exactly."
"Fallon, I know that you don't want to be part of my public life," he began and then paused to swallow.
"But, I want you in my life."
"You're right, Reid.
I don't really want to be part of your public life," Fallon stated.
His face fell.
"But, if we are going to make this work, I know I'll need to compromise."
A huge grin lit his face.
Then, Reid pulled her into his arms and crushed his mouth to hers.
Reid almost hadn't believed his ears.
He'd reacted before he knew what he was doing.
But, feeling her in his arms now, the way she was kissing him back, told him that he'd heard correctly.
The kiss had started out frenzied, but Reid slowed it down.
He wanted to savor her.
As the kiss deepened and Fallon softened against him, a tender peace began to spread through him.
He gently lifted her and she instinctively wrapped her legs around him.
Somehow, he found his way to her bedroom without breaking the kiss or running them into a wall.
After, laying her down on the bed and removing their clothing, he took his time making love to her.
He observed every sigh and moan before the sexual heat between them finally sent them both over the edge.
"What are you doing here?"
Fallon asked, pulling Reid out of his sensual fog as they lay there catching their breath.
They were lying on their backs and he turned his head towards her confused by her question.
"What do you mean, what am I doing here?"
he frowned.
"You weren't supposed to be back in town until Wednesday, Remember?"
Reid relaxed.
"Oh, well I finished up early.
My agent was negotiating my production schedule before I sign on for this movie.
They wanted an exclusive contract.
But, I have other engagements already contracted, and they need to work around those production schedules.
"Oh."
"So, you have me for the rest of the week," he said, turning to his side and grinning at her.
Shelton declined to come over once he called and found out Reid was there.
Reid suspected it was to give them time alone.
Reid did not leave at night either.
She'd gone to work on Tuesday and Reid was there with dinner waiting when she got home.
Chapter 37 Because she was not allowed to eat the day before her procedure, Fallon hadn't gone into work on Wednesday.
She also had to drink some stuff that made her go to the bathroom a lot.
She'd tried to kick him out and send him away, but he refused to go.
He was beginning to understand that she preferred going through things alone.
"All I'm going to be doing today is starve, drinking this nasty stuff, and going to the bathroom all day.
It's already disgusting, I don't need to be embarrassed too," she pushed.
Reid didn't budge.
"What is there to be embarrassed about?"
he asked amiably.
"So, we'll stay in and watch television and starve together."
She gave him a frustrated look, but appeared too tired and preoccupied to fight or argue.
So, they spent the day watching the DVR and pausing the television for her to either drink the clear stuff or run to the bathroom.
Reid made a point to only eat when Fallon was in the bathroom.
He felt guilty eating when she was starving and feeling awful from the stuff that she had to drink to clean her system out before the procedure.
But, he needed to eat.
The next morning, she was looking a little pale and tired when he hustled her out of bed to get ready for her appointment.
He made a point to pack a little snack bag for her so she could eat as soon as she woke up from the procedure.
He would take her to eat of course, but after not eating for over twenty-four hours, he assumed she'd be happy to eat just about anything when she woke up.
She was to arrive an hour before her appointment, but they took her in, in less than twenty minutes.
Reid was allowed to stay with her while they prepped her for the procedure though, of course, Fallon insisted it wasn't necessary.
He was getting pretty good at ignoring her protests.
He was surprised, however, to feel his palms sweating and his anxiety level rise when they put an I.V. in her arm and wheeled her away.
He sat there for twenty minutes are so forcing himself not to get up and pace.
Fallon awoke as they were completing the procedure.
She saw something on a monitor and asked what it was.
The tech or nurse, looked at her sharply and said they were all done.
They wheeled her back into the prepping area and told her the doctor would be there to talk to her in a few minutes.
Once they pulled the curtain around her little area, she got up and began dressing.
She was a little off balanced but otherwise fine.
"Are you okay?"
Reid asked, jumping to his feet to assist her.
"I'm fine," she said pulling on her shirt.
She was surprised that she was so comfortable dressing in front of Reid.
Then again, they'd been practically living together for the last week.
He'd had her naked plenty of times.
Still, this was the first time she'd dressed in front of him.
"Can you pass me my shoes?"
Reid looked so concerned and relieved.
Fallon didn't have time to ponder this as a nurse came in interrupting her train of thought.
"Oh, my.
You're awake?"
she said in surprise, and rushed to get a wheelchair for Fallon to sit in. "Sit, sit.
And, let me take the I.V. out of your arm."
She asked Fallon a few questions that she answered with no problem and removed the I.V.
"I'll go get the doctor.
I know you can walk, but we're required to wheel you out of here to your car," she said apologetically.
It seemed no sooner had the nurse left, then the doctor appeared with a paper in his hand.
He held it low so that Fallon could see it from her seat in the wheelchair, and then began talking with no preliminaries.
He seemed quite surprised and agitated.
"You had one polyp that we removed and one tumor that must be removed," he stated and Fallon heard Reid make a slight cry of surprise as the doctor continued and her heart began to race with fear.
"Do you know of a surgeon that you'd like to use?"
"I-I...no.
I don't know any surgeons," Fallon said dumbly feeling dumbstruck.
"Is it benign?"
The surgeon looked at her now with a doubtful expression and he seemed to calm the sense of urgency in his voice before he spoke again.
"We won't know that until after a biopsy of the samples has been done.
Either way, it's too big and needs to be removed.
I will have my office call you and give you the name of a very good surgeon I use.
She does laparoscopic surgery, and it's something that should be fairly easy."
"Thank you," Fallon said in a faraway sounding voice.
She felt numb and hot all at the same time.
Tears began to involuntarily prick her eyes.
Disbelief, shock, and fear were trying to break through her numbness.
Was she getting ready to re-experience the hell that she had just watched her father go through?
The doctor adopted an expression of outward detachment that doctors often do and nodded before walking away.
A nurse appeared and Reid pushed her wheelchair to the car as Fallon struggled to get her tears under control.
Her face was expressionless, but it was though her eyes were crying of their own accord.
She knew she would need to send Reid away so she could deal with whatever was coming, but at the moment she felt as though she were two beings completely detached.
