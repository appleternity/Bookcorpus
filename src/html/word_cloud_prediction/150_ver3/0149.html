This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Capability', 'tfidf': 0.556732708761934, 'lexical_unit': 'unable.a / able.a / capacity.n', 'definition': "An Entity meets the pre-conditions for participating in an Event.

"Yes."
"Hmmm...one million."
"OK."
Tim wrote it down, "Sayings.
Er...'burrr nothing'" "Yeah "shambapoo'".
"And he has a funny laugh."
"So over 20?"
"Four thousand.
He's doing very well so far isn't he?"
"What's next?"
"Job.
He is a mechanic in the RAF."
"Yes and he has a beard."
"Not really a job though is it?"
"No I suppose not."
"700 hundred million."
"Good score."
"Finally general discipleness.
Another 6 billion for that.
Giving him a grand total of..."
"Hold on what about another category.
Then we can work out a percentage more easily."
"OK what about friends?
The less friends the higher the score."
"Mungo's got us" "But we're more his carers.
So fifty?"" "I was thinking 67."
"Ok then 4867.
That gives him a grand total of...6 billion 701 million 8,867.
Percent."
"That will take some beating."
And of course it has never been beaten, except for one time in Portsmouth.
*** Time passes.
You head west.
You see Tim's house.
Alex is here, Tim is here.
Alex says "You going tonight?"
"Where?"
"It's Dave's party."
"Oh yeah I forgot."
Dave was having a house warming party.
He had left school a year earlier, and had bought a house on a new estate on the outskirts of Aylesbury with his friend, Welsh Bob.
Welsh Bob took a lot of pride in his appearance.
He wore expensive, but slightly out-of-date clothes, and he had highlighted hair.
It was very important for him to present an affluent image, and he once told Tim that he earnt "telephone numbers".
In actuality he was not paid particularly well, but felt the need to play one-upmanship with Tim and Dave, both of whom were very competitive.
Their salaries had become the main area of competition, and they told ever more elaborate lies regarding their earnings.
Tim claimed his part time wages at ADF were more than Dave earned at his full time job.
Dave claimed that he was on the fast track to management.
Both Tim and Dave knew the other was lying, but Welsh Bob believed every word out of their mouths.
Welsh Bob sold perfume for a large company, but told anyone who would listen that he was the chairman of the company, and was planning a management buyout 'imminently'.
*** Alex and Tim walked together from Tim's house to the Dave/Welsh Bob mansion.
They arrived early and Alex started helping Dave drink the beer and wine Welsh Bob had bought for the party, whilst Tim and Welsh Bob compared bank balances.
Alex was soon drunk (again).
Whilst the four drank the guests gradually arrived, and after a while the party became quite noisy.
There was a knock at the door only just audible above the noise.
Alex answered it.
It was a short man whose name was Rodney, "Who are you mate?"
"Rodney."
"You can't come in mate."
"Let me in."
"You can't come in." "C'mon.
Let me in."
"You can't come in!"
"Let me in!"
Dave had heard the commotion and drunkenly arrived at the door.
Alex reiterated: "Sorry mate you can't come in." Rodney became angry, "DON"T CALL ME MATE.
I DON'T KNOW YOUR FACE."
He pointed at Dave, "HE CAN CALL ME MATE COZ I KNOW HIS FACE.
BUT YOU CAN'T CALL ME MATE COZ I DON'T KNOW YOUR FACE."
The colour had drained out of Alex's face.
He realised immediately who Rodney was.
He was the Son of Roy, "OK come in then mate."
Rodney glided into the room.
Welsh Bob was sitting in the corner, "Hello.
My name is Welsh Bob.
And you are?"
"Rodney mate.
How's it going Welsh Bob?"
"Good!
I've just got a new job.
With a new car."
"Nice."
"Yes and a pay increase.
Not that I needed one!"
"What do you do Welsh Bob?"
"I am managing director of a large retail concern."
"He sells perfume."
Dave said helpfully.
"I am a managing director," said Welsh Bob angrily, "And what do you do Rodney?"
"I own Aylesbury.
I run Aylesbury."
"Ha ha.
No really."
"I OWN AYLESBURY!"
"Alright, calm down.
Well you don't own my house.
It's got an extension and a very large living room.
And it's a barn conversion."
"I AM THE SON OF ROY.
I HAVE COME TO HELP YOU DEFEAT RASTAS."
Alex could now see the likeness of Roy in Rodney's face.
Even though Rodney did not know Alex's face, Alex knew Rodney's face, because it was so similar to Roy's.12 He went to the kitchen to find Tim whowas standing talking to a man with a large scar on his forehead.
He looked like he might be a post man.
"Tim stop talking to that post man."
"Why?"
"Do you know who is in the lounge?"
"Welsh Bob?"
"No.
Well yes he is, but so is...Rodney."
"Who is he?"
"He says he is the son of Roy."
Tim stood dumb founded.
He was lost for words.
Eventually he said "How...how do you know?"
"He said so.
And he looks like Roy."
"You mean like an energy cloud?"
"Sort of, but more...his face looks like the vision of Roy in my heart."
"Then let's go see him."
They rushed back to the lounge.
Rodney had gone.
"Where is he?"
they asked Welsh Bob.
"Who?"
"Rodney."
"The chap who just arrived?"
"Yes."
"He said he had to leave."
"Did he say why?"
"He said he had to run Aylesbury."
"Did he say anything else?"
"Er...I don't think so."
"Are you sure?"
"Er..yes!
He said 'bye'" "It's a sign from Roy."
"Signifying what?"
"Hmmm...I don't know."
"You sure he didn't say anything else?"
"No. Oh hang on he said: 'Go see Colonel Tony on the moon13 on Thursday.'"
Suddenly the room began to shake, "TIMOTHY.
IT'S ROY."
"Hi Roy."
"HI.
IS RODNEY THERE?
TELL HIM HIS TEA IS READY."
"No he has gone."
"DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT COLONEL TONY?"
"He said to go on Thursday."
"AND TO BRING THE DISCIPLES?"
"No just to go on Thursday."
