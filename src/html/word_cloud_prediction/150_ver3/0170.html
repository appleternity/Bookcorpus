'If you ain't got nothin' better to do, I 'd like to shoot the breeze with you for a couple.' 'We used to chat about everything.'"}, {'frame': 'Calendric_unit', 'tfidf': 1.2078287601470947, 'lexical_unit': 'one day.n / second.n / fortnight.n', 'definition': "Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Residence', 'tfidf': 0.5587560051558438, 'lexical_unit': 'inhabit.v / dweller.n / stay.v', 'definition': "This frame has to do with people (the Residents) residing in Locations, sometimes with a Co-resident.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

Someone dies either by his own hand or in an accident and the victim's family and friends assume that a couple of forms are signed and the investigation ends there.
They don't realize that the police need to answer how said accident or suicide came about.
Travis's face turned red.
"Figures that cow would turn this place into a circus."
"I'm sure David and his crew will do everything they can to stay out of your way."
Mac drained the coffee mug.
The writer sucked in a deep breath.
"Want another cup?"
After Mac accepted his offer, he took the mug.
Mac followed him into the kitchen.
The pantry included a walk-in refrigerator.
The top-of-the-line appliances and utensils shone like they had never been used.
He assumed Sophia wouldn't lower herself to common household duties such as cooking.
Travis poured Mac's coffee into the mug from a technically intimidating coffee maker.
"I suggest you look at the police chief, Roy Phillips."
He handed the mug back to Mac.
"If that's his real name."
"What makes you think it isn't?"
Travis leaned against the kitchen counter.
He crossed his arms over his chest.
"Betsy was a frustrated writer.
Since we got here, she's been spending her free time working on her own book.
I offered to recommend it to my agent after she finished it.
She got this idea for a story about a small-town police chief who was really a murderer hiding from the law.
For the last year, she's been following Roy around.
Somehow she got under his skin.
I saw them at the Inn a few days ago and he told her in no uncertain terms to stay away from him.
He shook her up pretty bad.
By the time I got home, she was drunk and babbling that he was going to kill her."
He cocked his head at Mac.
"You don't think that maybe she found out something and he killed her, do you?"
"Hey, Mac?"
David called from the hallway before entering the kitchen.
"There you are.
The state police are here and the cottage is open.
Are you coming to check it out?"
Betsy Weaver's home had one bedroom, a bathroom the size of a walk-in closet, a kitchenette, and a great room with a dining area.
The great room served as her office.
She had a small patio area that, judging by the lack of furniture, she didn't take advantage of.
The smell of musty carpets, dirty laundry, and rotting garbage assaulted Mac's and David's nostrils when they stepped through the door to search for the cause of her death.
Notepads like the type Mac had seen her writing in filled every flat surface available: kitchen counter and table, end tables, coffee tables, crammed in among the books on her bookshelves, sofa, and floor.
Not a page was left unmarked.
"Steve realizes the sheriff killed his missing wife.
He tricks him into leading him to the body by making him think he had already found it," David read a paragraph from a notebook on top of the stack on the kitchen table.
Bills in unopened envelopes rested next to the notepads.
"Travis says Betsy was a frustrated writer."
Mac went to the sofa.
An empty prescription pill bottle rested on the floor under the coffee table.
Not wanting to touch it for fear of disturbing evidence, he pointed at it with his hand encased in evidence gloves that David had given him.
"Pill bottle, but it doesn't have a pharmacy label on it."
"Maybe she was self-medicating."
David snapped a picture of the bottle on the floor, as well as the empty wine bottle next to a water glass with residue of red wine crusted at the bottom.
He recognized the label on the bottle as being a cheap wine available at the local store.
"Pills and booze."
He shook his head.
"What a way to go."
"What was here?"
Mac had noticed rust-marked indentations in the carpet in the corner of the room.
The marks formed a rectangle next to a minute computer desk that held a laptop computer and printer.
"File cabinet."
The answer came from the open front door.
Travis leaned casually in the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest.
"Where is it now?"
Mac asked.
"Don't know," Travis answered.
"It was locked.
Betsy lost the key a long time ago and couldn't get into it.
When Sophia and I came back from California a few weeks ago, the cabinet was gone.
She must have gotten rid of it."
When David demanded to know what had been in it, Travis shrugged while replying, "Manuscripts.
Contracts.
Whatever it is people keep in locked file cabinets."
The author looked around the cluttered room.
"If you won't be needing me, Sophia and I have appointments with our hair stylists.
Can you be sure to get that body out of here before you leave?
We're hosting a party tomorrow."
Stunned by the order, Mac glanced at David, who paused long enough for Travis to read the glare in his eyes before responding.
"Betsy Weaver will be moved after, and only after, the medical examiner has completed her on-scene examination.
I'm sure if Betsy was aware of how inconvenient her dying next to your pool was going to be to you, she would have chosen someplace else to expire."
Travis uttered a noise that sounded like a "humph" before sauntering back to his house.
David muttered, "Did fame make him that self-centered or has he always been like that?"
"You tell me."
Mac went into the bedroom.
House cleaning-wise, he found it to be the same as the rest of the cottage.
The closet overflowed with two piles of laundry.
One pile smelled clean, the other didn't.
Water glasses with varying amounts of water littered the nightstand too small to hold everything on it.
It also contained an alarm clock, lamp, and cordless phone crammed to the side closest to the bed.
Why does she have everything crammed to one side?
Mac knelt to study the set up.
What was on the far side of the stand?
When he opened the door on the front of the nightstand, an avalanche of notebooks spilled out.
Like the others, notes filled the pages, front and back.
The nightstand also had a drawer that contained one notepad that appeared to have been started recently and a pill case, which Mac recognized to be birth control pills.
"Travis told me that Betsy didn't date," he called out into the living room.
"As long as I've known her, I've never seen Betsy with anyone."
David came into the bedroom where Mac held up the pill case.
"How long have you known her?"
"Since she moved back here with Travis after he hit the big time," David answered.
"She's been living here in the guest cottage for years."
He paused before adding, "Come to think of it, she probably spent more time here than Travis."
"Anyone stay here with her?"
David shrugged his shoulders.
"Someone could have.
I know she stayed here by herself that whole summer Travis and Sophia got married and honeymooned in Europe.
We should ask Archie.
Betsy was a big fan of Robin and used to visit her."
"Robin did mention her in her journal.
No boyfriend?
Are you sure?"
"None that I know of."
David suggested that some doctors would put women on oral contraceptives for medical reasons other than birth control.
For example, to control their menstrual cycle.
Mac was half-listening.
Something sharp had punctured his knee.
He rose up to find that he had put a hole in his pants.
Blood seeped from a small wound.
Imbedded in the carpet where he had been kneeling, he found the cause of his injury: a shard of glass.
"With all those glasses on the nightstand, she must have knocked one off," David suggested.
Mac studied the clear piece of glass.
The water glasses were thick and rounded.
This four-inch-long piece was thin, flat, and clear.
One edge was a clean and straight cut.
He held the broken glass up on the vacant portion of the nightstand.
"What do you think?"
he asked.
"Picture frame?"
David glanced around the room.
The trash contained no broken glass.
"Where's the picture now?"
"Maybe the boyfriend knows."
One of the town's police officers stuck his head in through the doorway.
"The ME is done.
Want to talk to her before they haul away the body?"
The body bag rested open on top of the gurney.
It took two troopers and two Spencer officers to lift Betsy's body to put on it.
Along with the medical examiner, David and Mac examined the body before they zipped the bag shut to take her to the morgue.
Betsy stared up at them with cloudy gray eyes.
"Any idea how long she's been dead?"
David asked the medical examiner, an attractive middle-aged woman with her long blond hair pulled up and clipped to the back of her head.
"The blood had settled in her back, but she was found face down.
The body has definitely been moved."
The medical examiner explained, "Plus, her body temperature doesn't jive with the outside temperature and the condition of her body.
In my opinion, she's been put on ice."
Chapter Sixteen "This is the smartest dog I've ever seen in my life--and I've seen a lot of dogs in my life."
A lot of dogs, Bernie O'Reilly had seen.
While Mac was at the Turner home getting the low-down on the body next to their pool, Archie found Priscilla Hardwick's sister, Bernie.
The dog trainer and breeder had sold Helga the poodle to the late couple.
After some negotiation with animal control, Archie got permission to turn Helga over to Bernie, who lost no time racing to the Spencer Manor to collect the dog.
Big-boned and taller than her sister, Bernie wore khaki shorts, work boots, and a dusty safari hat on her head.
