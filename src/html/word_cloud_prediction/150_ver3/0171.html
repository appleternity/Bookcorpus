That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

So when they received a new lead they headed off to View Valley High School immediately.
Detective Stevens and Khumalo were the head of the missing persons division.
Since Tanner's parents had gone to great lengths to put pressure on the police to solve this case they worked around the clock to find out what had happened to him.
So the detectives rushed off to the high school and made it in time for the start of the fifth period- just as soon as the children and teachers were returning to class from break time.
Detective Khumalo asked the teacher if he could speak to Hunter outside and was granted permission to do so.
Everybody wondered why the police wanted to speak to him.
Everybody knew that he never had any affiliation with Tanner.
Hunter hung around with the rich popular kids- the ones who bullied and terrorised other students and, sometimes, even teachers.
Tanner was the complete opposite.
"Do you know why we're here."
Detective Stevens asked.
"Detective," Hunter spat out the word as if it were an insult, "if you don't know why you're here then how should I?"
"You're a real smart ass, huh?"
"Better than being a dumb ass, right!?"
Hunter quickly replied with as much attitude that he could summon.
"Lalela-" Detective Khumalo said but Hunter cut him off.
"I don't speak Zulu or any other language.
My surname may be Mashaba but as you can see by my skin- I'm coloured."
"I'm tired of your shit!"
Detective Stevens barked out.
"We're here because we have a witness that claims they saw you with Tanner Du Toit on the day that he went missing."
"Fuck you!"
Hunter said before laughing.
"That's it, asshole, we're going down to the station."
"Lemme call my lawyer, first," Hunter said as he reached his hand into his pocket.
After punching in the numbers he handed the phone over to Detective Stevens whom was the older of the pair.
He was surprised by this action but when he heard the voice at the end of the line a chill ran through his spine.
Being in the SAPS for a long time he could recognise the voice of his commander within the room of several voices speaking over one another.
"Mr Mashaba, how can I help?"
"This is Detective Stevens, sir."
Out of shock and disbelief the detective didn't know what to say.
The hoarse, deep voice of his commander ran through him.
"Where's Hunter?"
"He's with us, sir.
We received information that he was involved in the Du Toit case."
He replied- convinced that his commander would be pleased since there was so much pressure and media coverage around this case.
He forgot that he hadn't been the one whom called his commander.
"Listen here- if you don't want to spend the rest of your days doing paperwork in Limpopo then I suggest you stop pursuing any leads about Hunter.
Do you understand?"
"Sir, but-" "Do. You. Understand?"
"Ja, sir!"
The commander had a naturally loud voice that demanded attention.
So Hunter and Detective Khumalo heard the whole conversation clearly.
Detective Stevens threw the phone towards Hunter and stomped off.
His anger made him overlook questions like: Why did this teenage boy have the commander's number?
Why was he on a first name basis with the commander?
As Hunter got into class all the students focused their gaze on him.
When he smiled they all knew that the run in with the police had been nothing serious.
Hunter took his seat.
The teacher was about to continue the lesson when a knock on the door had stopped her from doing so.
A boy with dreads and a scar underneath his eye walked into the classroom.
'It's him,' Hunter whispered under his breath.
Even though he tried not to stare he couldn't resist.
When the Sister's of the Sea had revealed him to Hunter he noticed a slight resemblance.
Now within a few feet away he could see that the resemblance was uncanny.
Could this be one of my father's kids, he thought.
It was no secret to him that his father had multiple affairs with women.
So it wasn't a large assumption.
It never bothered him in the past because to his knowledge he was the only one going to receive the inheritance.
However something was different this time around.
None of that mattered anymore as he looked at the new boy.
A part of him hoped that they were related.
Second break's arrival was highly anticipated by Hunter, Bear and Raven who had all been made aware of the new boy's arrival.
Each one of them were more impatient than ever.
With nothing but certainty they knew that all their dreams would come true once they had formed their circle.
All they had to do was make the new boy join their cause.
Which they knew wouldn't be so hard because fate had been predestined.
It was decided that Raven would be the one to speak to him.
There was a certain charm about her that she could use to manipulate people.
This same charm had been the reason why Tanner had turned a blind eye to all the red flags.
Hunter and Bear had been seen hanging around together for the first time.
Bear was a rugby player and associated himself with his team at all times.
They were the best team in the country for two consecutive years.
A large part of that was based on their strong bond.
That didn't matter to Bear anymore.
As he stood next to Hunter he ignored his friends' greetings.
He knew that all the sacrifices and spells that they made in the past were for this moment.
Back then, due to all the things they had done, their association with each other would be the cause of many questions.
Now they wouldn't have to worry about their town folk.
They were about to enter into a new league; a new league that was much more dangerous but offered many rewards.
After a few minutes of searching Raven had finally found him sitting outside on a bench.
In his hand he held a novel and in his other hand he held a chicken and mayonnaise sandwich.
She thought she was ready for this moment but as soon as she laid her eyes on him she realised that she was mistaken.
Within her belly she felt things that she had never felt before.
'This must be what people mean when they say they have butterflies in their tummy.'
She whispered to herself.
The new boy had been made aware of her presence.
He looked up towards her.
As their eyes locked all of her charm flew out of the window and she stood before him- shy.
As much as she tried to speak the words didn't come out of her mouth.
Luckily for her he took initiative.
"Hello," he said with a welcoming smile, "my name is Kenyan.
What's your name?"
Get a grip of yourself, the voice inside her head had commanded her.
"Duuude.
My name's Raven.
A couple of my buddies and I are going to a music show tonight.
We figured since you're new.
You'd like to come."
To her surprise the words flew out of her mouth faster than normal.
Even the tone of her voice sounded different to her ears.
"Yeah sure.
Are they going to be playing blues or pop music."
He asked - since these were the two biggest genres in the world he figured that it would be either one of these.
He couldn't stand the sound of pop music.
"It's like neither," was her reply.
"Duuude, I can bet my soul that it's a sound you haven't heard before."
With that being said the two exchanged numbers and bade each other farewell.
When she had returned to Hunter and Bear she couldn't bring herself to tell them how warm he had made her feel.
It was embarrassing because she was the one who usually made boys, and even some girls, feel that way.
Having a taste of her own medicine was something she hated.
To make matters worse she knew that they could never be together since they were about to be in the same band.
"So we're on."
Hunter said as he clapped his hands.
Chapter 3
So This Is What It's Called
My first day at school had been strangely uncomfortable but welcoming.
Although it was weird, I can honestly say that I know I'm going to enjoy my time here in View Valley.
Nobody knows me, who my father was or my story.
Nobody looks at me with those sympathetic eyes.
However there was one boy who looked at me as if he knew me.
I think his name is Hunter.
It was a bit strange but what was stranger was the fact that he kind of looks like me.
Well despite the fact that he's coloured and I'm black he looks exactly like me.
Doppelganger- I think that's what they call it.
Of all the students he was the only one that had tattoos.
They covered both of his arms.
'He's a rebel I can chill with.'
I thought out loud.
Then it hit me that mom would probably want me to avoid company like that.
Looking around at the loft and looking back to the week we just had I didn't want to mess up this job up for her.
Mom's new boss had allowed us to stay at a few of his hotels as we drove down from Jo'burg to Cape Town.
In all the 16 years of my life I had never experienced life like that.
We were treated like royalty.
This was all before mom even started the job so I imagined how things would be once she started earning a salary.
Mom didn't want to tell me but I assumed that she was going to receive a high income.
That's what she deserved.
I mean she didn't spend all those years in university to graduate and receive a degree in accounting for nothing.
Grabbing my phone off the table I decided that it would best if I gave her a call to let her know of my plans for tonight.
Had this been the past I would have just gone out but I promised myself that I would put in maximum effort to be on my best behaviour.
After a couple of rings mom answered the phone.
"Hello, mom, a couple of friends at school want me to hang out with them at a music show.
Is it cool if I go?
I might come home late."
"Where are you now, Kenya?"
"At home."
"Okay, kiddo, you can go but don't come back too late."
She took in a deep breath.
"Thank you for letting me know.
It's up to us to make things right this time, okay?"
