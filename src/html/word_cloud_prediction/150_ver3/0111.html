'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.

'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).

This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

she says, with a burning face.
"I have five pounds, seventeen and fourpence; and I do wish you would not call me 'Una,' but 'Miss Latreille.'"
"I will call you anything you like if you will become Mrs. Broughton before I go to Paris."
Paris!
How Una would like to re-visit the famous city and enjoy its attractions, no longer the withdrawn schoolgirl who knew it of yore.
Then she remembers her objection to honeymoons, and reflects it would not be pleasant escorted by one travelling on business, to run the risk of meeting any of her former associates, some of whom have married into the nobility.
"Will you think it over, Miss Latreille?"
asks Keith Broughton.
"You can send me a line at your convenience to tell me your decision.
I see you have not breakfasted yet, so I will not intrude: but I hope as soon as possible you will come back to St. Pensart's as your home."
"He is evidently afraid of losing me," thinks Una, with some self-complacence.
"He is determined to make an effort to rise socially, and he is sorely anxious to get a wife of good birth, poor fellow.
He pretends to be concerned as to my own comfort, but self is at the bottom of his anxiety.
He fears, perhaps, that during my visits I may meet somebody more eligible.
I certainly should have done so had I ever enjoyed a London season, like other girls.
Did not Ida Valecourt marry a prince?
And she had no beauty except her figure!
I wonder what I had better do.
As he is going abroad, I should not have to endure his company yet awhile, that is one consideration!"
"Must I unpack, then, madam?"
asks Valerie, her maid, on hearing the Brighton visit is abandoned.
"I have everything strapped and covered, but I can soon get out your dresses.
I had better hang them again if madam is remaining here longer."
"No," says Una, "I feel I must have a change of some sort.
I am getting restless.
It is so lonely in this great house without Uncle Hugh.
Valerie, I want someone to ride into Westborough with a note. Mrs. Perriss, of the Knoll, has invited me, and I shall visit her for a few days.
Be ready to accompany me this afternoon."
Una is not only feeling lonely, but disquieted and out of sorts.
She is beginning to long for company and for some relief from her own thoughts.
Although she has never yet been on intimate terms with the mistress of the Knoll, she feels the conversational widow will be an acceptable companion after her solitude since the loss of her uncle.
<><><><>
Mrs. Perriss has no intention of warning Una, as May Clevethorne did, not to marry without love.
Her own ideas of happiness are not very exalted, and comfortable means would be her first consideration in studying the pros and cons of matrimony on behalf of any young protegee.
She considers Una would be "flying in the face of Providence" not to secure St. Pensart's as quickly as possible, and in her heart she likes the little she has seen of Keith Broughton.
"Of course, my dear," she tells Una confidentially, "you cannot see much of his mother.
I believe she does lead a retired sort of life, and very sensible of her, considering what she was.
Nor can you know his cousins and his aunts, and so forth.
People like those must be taught their proper places.
They need a great deal of repressing, as a rule, but I can see that with you they would not take liberties twice."
The end of Una's deliberations is that she sends Keith Broughton a brief note.
"It can be while I am here;" and that same evening he calls to see her, having been unable to leave the claims of business at the mill earlier.
Mrs.
Perriss is nodding in an easy chair, and her companion is out of the room, so the two have every opportunity for a lover-like talk, but such a notion seems to occur to neither.
"Shall we say Friday week, Miss Latreille?"
he asks, taking out a business-like notebook.
"I am afraid that is the latest date available."
"When do you cross?"
asks Una, turning over a series of Venetian views with interest.
"I must leave London Friday afternoon.
I find the workmen at St. Pensart's need not interfere at all with your comfort, so you could return there when convenient.
I thought if we could be married quite early on Friday morning...."
"Oh, my dear, never be married on a Friday!"
says Mrs. Perriss, rousing slightly and opening her eyes.
"Did I hear you say Friday, Mr. Broughton?
I must really advise Una not to tempt Providence by choosing a day well known to be unfortunate."
"Oh, that day will do as well as any other," says Una indifferently, "and the earlier the better.
I do not want anybody I know in the church.
Friday week, then, Mr. Broughton."
And her tone is cold and careless, as though leaving an order at a costumier's.
Mrs. Perriss looks shocked to think of a wedding on Friday, but closes her eyes resignedly, and Broughton rises to go.
"Miss Latreille," he says hesitatingly, "before I leave England I should like, if convenient to you, to take you to see my mother.
She cannot get out much this cold weather, but----"
"Mr. Broughton," says Una coldly, "it is a delicate subject to touch upon, but I prefer that my acquaintance with your family shall not extend beyond yourself.
I have consented to marry you, but please understand from the beginning, I decline to know your family."
He makes no answer, but looks at her for a moment as if he could say a great deal.
She congratulates herself that never again will he propose a Latreille should visit his common, assuming mother.
"Friday week at nine o'clock," he tells her quietly, and the words seem to toll in her ears like funeral notes through every day that lies between.
Chapter 3
"For Better, For Worse"
U na has more than one interview with Mr. Craig, Keith Broughton's solicitor, but she does not expect to see any more of her future husband till they stand at the altar of St. Luke's Church, Westborough, on the approaching marriage morning.
She is, therefore, somewhat astonished when on returning from a drive with Mrs. Perriss on the Thursday afternoon she hears he is waiting to see her.
"No doubt he has brought the wedding ring," says her hostess, in a low voice.
"Mind you offer him some tea, my dear.
I shall join you after I have changed my things."
Una walks, proud and erect, into the drawing room, retaining her out-of-door things as a hint that she has no leisure to spare for callers.
He is looking rather nervous, and a sudden fear comes to Una that he has lost his money.
Some bank may have failed, or some great financial calamity have occurred.
Of course, if such be the case, he would not think of holding her to her promise.
"Is anything the matter, Mr. Broughton?"
she inquires.
"I did not expect to see you till tomorrow."
"The fact is," he answers abruptly, "I have been a good deal disturbed in mind, Una, and I have had a serious talk this week with my mother, too.
She has been too poorly to discuss matters with me before, but she is anxious concerning both of us.
So before you put it out of your power to arrange your destiny more brightly, I want you to think the question over -- are you not procuring unhappiness for yourself by our marriage?"
"I can quite understand," says Una haughtily.
"Your mother resents your marrying one who cannot know her, but her interference comes too late.
The curate has postponed a journey to perform the ceremony tomorrow, and I have acquainted the servants at home that they may expect me back in the afternoon.
Mrs.
Perriss and her companion are coming, too, for a few days, and so I shall not be left to mope.
I dislike being alone."
"As to that," he answers gently, "you will be mistress, and you will invite whom you please.
But pray do not misunderstand my meaning.
My mother reasons probably in her own mind, though she has never done so in words, that if you cared for your future husband you would wish to know his mother.
And if you do not care for him, will not the day come when you will wish yourself unfettered?
Ask your heart this question, dear, before it is too late."
"I am not going to be made a public laughingstock to gratify your mother," says Una with dignity.
"The servants here have told all the neighbourhood that tomorrow I shall be married.
And besides, Mrs. Perriss has bought a large cake, though I tried to persuade her nobody expects cake at such a quiet affair as ours."
"The cake can soon be settled for," he replies.
"Do not spoil your life because a cake has been purchased."
"What do you want?"
she asks, after a pause.
"Is all this preamble an effort to free yourself?"
"You know what I want," he answers quietly.
"I cared for you when a train of flatterers hung round you wherever you went, and the dearest wish of my heart is to call you my wife."
"Of course, and then you will be second cousin to the Earl of Glenrhaer," says Una scornfully.
"That is not a trifling lift in the social scale for----"
"I hope you are very well, Mr. Broughton," says Mrs. Perriss graciously, as she comes upon the scene in a grey and black tea gown, a charming half-mourning confection.
"He looks out of temper," she thinks.
"Surely that foolish girl need not irritate him before she is mistress of the situation.
St.
Pensart's is too good to be lost, but girls are so sure of their power that they make sad mistakes sometimes.
Suppose he is not at the church tomorrow?"
"Everything is so nicely settled," she tells him.
"The bells are to strike up directly you are pronounced man and wife together.
I admire the custom, so I took it on myself to arrange that matter.
And you will come here afterwards and get something to eat.
How very unfortunate, though, that business calls you to Paris."
"Oh, it does not matter," says Broughton absently.
"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Perriss, I was thinking of something else."
"We must all think about a cup of tea at present," the lady answers amiably.
"We have been to see the Whitmores at Vale Abbey.
It was a long, cold drive, so Una and I are quite ready for some refreshment."
"I must ask you to excuse me," says Keith Broughton.
"As I leave tomorrow, this is a very busy day with me.
Then, Miss Latreille, is it all settled for tomorrow?
There is to be no change in the arrangements?"
He has turned to Una, and he catches an indistinct murmur about "Uncle Hugh's last wishes," then his fiancee says, with more composure, "Certainly, everything is settled.
Even the cake has come home, and Mrs. Perriss is going to stay with me for a time at St. Pensart's."
"Mrs. Perriss will be very welcome," he says gallantly.
"Goodbye then, ladies, till tomorrow: I am sorry such an early hour was necessary, but there is only one train that will catch the Dover express from town."
"He is a very undemonstrative fiance, my dear," says the widow, as the two sit over their tea.
"What an unromantic leave-taking!
But perhaps my presence restrained sentimentality."
"Oh dear, no.
Neither Mr. Broughton nor myself intend to go in for sentiment," says Una.
"One hears enough of that kind of thing in connection with breach-of-promise cases.
How ridiculous all the love-making seems a few years later!
I have always been a practical sort of person, and I leave romance to the novelists."
"Well," says Mrs. Perriss, "I hope you will be as happy as I was.
Arthur was only a struggling barrister when we married.
Success came after many years, but those days were very bright ones."
And she sighs, looking into the flickering fire.

Friday, despite its reputation for ill luck, dawns bright and beaming.
"An ideal wedding morning," Mrs. Perriss tells her guest.
Una is almost disinclined to turn out so early, the weather being keen and cold.
As it is, she is late at the church, and the curate, having a bad cold, is rather put out at having to wait unduly in the chill, unwarmed atmosphere of the building.
Una is attended only by her hostess, but many of the servants from St. Pensart's are present, as well as some in the employ of Mrs. Perriss.
