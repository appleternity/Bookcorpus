The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Moving_in_place', 'tfidf': 1.203490138053894, 'lexical_unit': 'shake.v / rock.v / wave.v', 'definition': "A Theme moves with respect to a Fixed_location, generally with a certain Periodicity, without undergoing unbounded translational motion or significant alteration of configuration/shape.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

He was a child floating down the river on an inner tube, the cold water numbing his legs and the hot sun warming his shoulders.
Peaceful, he drifted.
After long moments the air became cooler.
With a shiver he opened his eyes.
The last rays of the once searing sun cast a lingering light into his alcove.
He struggled to his feet and steadied himself against the cliff wall.
His fingers brushed over faint indentations.
Curious, he studied the pattern of engravings carved in the cliff wall.
Though badly weathered, he could still make out the ancient script.
Loosely translated it read, The last of the springs of youth that make fertile the plains below.
Jacques shivered and ran his hand through the hollow where the pool had been.
Not a drop of water.
Just dry dust.
He began the descent to the plain.
I took my last bite of Cheerios waiting to hear the rest of the story, knowing I would need to comment on the important discovery.
The room was silent.
I looked up.
Dad stared at me, waiting for my reaction.
I swallowed hard.
Somehow I had missed it.
"Uh, nice poetry on the wall.
Sort of cryptic."
Dad looked surprised.
"Guess you're going to explain it later?"
I headed for the door.
Dad frowned and looked down at his laptop screen.
"I thought the fountain of youth was obvious."
Great.
Dad was on his youth kick again and it had slipped by me.
There was no time to cover my mistake now, but I gave it a quick try.
"I like it," I offered.
"Can't wait for the next chapter."
That was a stupid comment, I thought.
I escaped to the basement.
The dryer cycle was not finished, but the jacket felt hot.
I hurried out into the crisp morning.
The jacket's heat faded quickly.
Patches had not thoroughly dried, and they rapidly turned cold in a nasty damp sort of way.
It was a relief to get it off when I got to school.
I dropped my backpack to the floor, opened the locker, and stuffed the jacket inside.
The torn sleeve faced me.
Washing had widened the rip, and stuffing now poked through the frayed edges of the gash.
My backpack slumped against my leg.
Looking down I saw a designer shoe just inches away.
I raised my eyes in resignation.
As I expected, the shoe belonged to Doug.
"Wow, Josh, check out this jacket."
He fingered the material and poked at the stuffing.
"You were right to be concerned about Cody getting lost in the woods.
Looks like he had a run in with something."
"Must have been something with big claws to leave a rip like that," Josh said.
"How do you suppose he managed to escape?"
I slammed the locker.
To my amusement, Doug jumped and jerked his fingers out of the way.
He flushed with anger.
"Did something get out of the burial ground?"
Josh taunted.
"Guess you'll have to find out for yourself," I said.
"If you have the nerve."
Doug leaned toward me, his eyes dark with contempt.
In his best mocking voice he said, "Aren't we a little old for tales of a haunted forest?
It doesn't take much nerve for a stroll through the woods."
"Is that so?"
A girl with long red hair and a fearless look appeared by my side.
Doug smiled as he honed in on a new victim.
"Well, well.
If it isn't the Gen, Gen the elven queen," he said.
I started to smile, remembering when we were all five and Gen had worn fairy wings all summer.
One glance at her scowling face and the charming memory faded.
I ducked my head and made sure there was no trace of a smile when I looked up again.
With a smirk, Josh bowed to Gen and said, "Never fear, Lady Guenivere.
We cut through those woods all the time.
Neither fairies, nor trolls, nor even ghosts are a terror for us."
Disgust filled me leaving a nasty taste in my mouth.
"Well why would two squirrels be..."
I began when another voice broke in.
"You're not brave.
You're just sneaks."
Gen looked up at a tall skinny kid with a weathered cap.
His straight black hair poked out around the strap in the back.
"Elroy," Gen said with a sigh, "let it go."
His voice took on a grating whine.
"They don't go through the woods.
I know..."
"You don't know anything," Josh said narrowing his eyes.
His eyebrows almost met over his nose.
It was a sinister look he had been trying to perfect ever since we were in kindergarten.
"Stay out of this, Elroy, or you'll find yourself in the woods...alone."
Elroy pushed up his glasses.
The lens magnified his eyes making him look startled.
"Ha!
I'm not afraid of the woods."
He jabbed his finger at Josh.
"You just pretend to go in.
I know where you really go."
Josh's eyebrows moved from antagonistic to anxious and I wondered if Elroy was on to something.
A hand fell on my shoulder.
Too late, I realized it wasn't Elroy that had changed Josh's expression.
"It isn't like you to be late for class, Cody," Mr. Bertram said.
My heart sank.
Not the science teacher.
Why did it have to be Bertram?
I had worked too hard to make an impression with him.
Now these Neanderthals were wrecking any hope of a scientific career.
Gen turned on her heel and marched into literature class.
Josh and Doug skirted around Bertram like puppies scampering past a Great Dane.
"It's just lit class," I mumbled.
Mr.
Bertram looked down over his large mustache.
His voice was quiet.
"A necessary discipline even for research professionals.
A scientist needs to be educated in myth in order to be able to distinguish between fact and fiction."
He handed me my backpack and walked away. Ms. Kendrick waited in the doorway.
Compared to Bertram she was tiny, like a bird next to a rhinoceros.
I hurried past her and slipped into my seat.
"Psst."
Gen leaned across the aisle.
Her hair slid over her shoulder and brushed the desktop.
"Did you really see something in the woods?"
Her green eyes sparkled.
Before I could answer, the bell rang.
A smile trembled on her lips and she said, "We'll talk after school."
Ms. Kendrick started class the same way she always did.
She perched on the edge of her desk, smiled sweetly at the class, and recited her opening line.
Several of the kids mouthed the words with her.
"Let's consider the possibilities."
From there she began her lecture on the ancient tale of Beowulf and his battle with the monster.
Then she posed the question.
"How much of the mythical might have been real?"
Unfortunately that was our cue to join the discussion.
I hadn't even seen the movie.
The only good thing was that Josh and Doug knew less about Beowulf than I did.
The day dragged by, but finally the last bell rang.
I took my time at the locker.
No sense in rushing.
Gen was always late for everything.
When I finally strolled outside, the buses were already pulling away.
At least I lived close enough to the school that I didn't have to ride the bus.
Leaning on the bleachers in what I hoped was a cool stance, I waited for Gen.
It wasn't long before several girls bounced down the steps all giggling and talking at once.
It was one mass of incomprehensible girl noise.
Gen separated from the group.
Walking backwards toward the bleachers she waved and called to the other girls until she was right in front of me.
Then she spun around and almost fell into my arms.
"Whoa!"
She teetered and caught her balance.
Another opportunity lost.
"Ready?"
I asked.
"Ready to hear about your adventure in the woods."
