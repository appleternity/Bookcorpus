Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

"Do you know what I like most about you, Miss Chase?"
he asked as he beckoned her to the bed and handed her a fork.
She took it and smiled at him in thanks as she climbed onto the bed with him.
"You can call me Victoria," she said smoothly, "and I'll call you Malcolm instead of your majesty.
So what do you like most about me?"
His hand reached out to touch her thigh gently.
"What you just did right there.
That you face me head on," he said as he slid his hand up her leg, massaging her gently.
She couldn't help but quiver slightly at his touch.
There was just something about this man that she couldn't wrap her head around.
These games, his strength, his mind; they all set her body burning with passion.
She hated it.
She couldn't stand it.
Yet, the longer the two of them interacted, the more she craved him.
"Save your pretty flattery for another woman, Malcolm," she responded hotly.
"I'm not going to be one of your loyal followers.
I came here to do a job."
He nodded as he continued to caress her thigh, letting his fingers glide down over her mound.
"Of course you did.
You should eat first, and I will be sure to give you the complete tour for your story," he said with a twinkle in his eye.
"I'll show you every sort of depraved act that happens in my underground kingdom."
Once again, his words caused her body to tremble.
Stop it! she demanded mentally.
"I'm sure you will," she said as she shoved her fork into the lobster viciously.
"Just not in my ass."
"Victoria, I told you this already.
Once I put my hands on a woman, no one else can touch her.
She is mine," he said strongly.
He placed a bit of caviar on his tongue, but kept his gaze on her the entire time.
She could feel her ass tighten in excitement, but she was far too scared of being hurt.
It was painful to admit that while she was willing to do almost anything for a story, she could not do this.
She took a seat down on the bed and lifted a bit of caviar into her mouth.
The delicate flavor caressed her taste buds enchantingly, and she moaned with pleasure.
She immediately took another spoonful before looking up at him suspiciously.
"If you think this meal is going to weaken my defenses, you're wrong."
He looked stunned for a moment as he put down his fork.
"Victoria," he said softly.
"You're going to let me have you in the way I choose."
"No. Malcolm," she said sharply, cutting him off and pointing accusingly between his legs.
"Look at that fucking thing!
It's huge, and you were so rough with me outside in the hallway.
You managed to make me come so hard that I passed out.
Who does that?
My breasts still ache and I feel like my insides are on fire!"
She huffed and glared at him.
She had been swept away in the thrill of those acts in the moment, but there was no way she could trust him with something as delicate as fucking her asshole.
"You loved it," he commented.
"I could see it in your eyes."
She let out an exasperated sigh.
"Yes, of course I did.
What girl doesn't love it when a strong man pushes her around a little?"
she asked with a slight blush.
"It's nice to feel like a woman.
It's just that..."
She paused as she gathered her thoughts.
"This isn't my life.
I'm here for a job, and I'm not going to let some whack-job billionaire with an ass fetish fuck me with his monster cock, rip me apart, and keep me from living my actual life."
He seemed to consider her words for a moment.
He then began sliding his hand down her thigh, gently touching her clit.
Malcolm's eyes held a look she couldn't quite identify.
"I'm not like other men," he said slowly; "you need to trust me."
She furrowed her brows at his words and became confused.
He didn't give her much time to think about it before he pulled her across the bed effortlessly.
The cacophonous sound of shattering porcelain filled the air as the plate she was using crashed onto the floor.
She yelped at the sudden feeling of his lips pressing against hers.
Instinctively, she found herself kissing back with equal passion.
Malcolm shoved the food tray onto the ground.
A moment ago, she had been afraid, but now she couldn't help but get caught up in the whirlwind of lust.
What is he doing to me? she mentally asked.
He planted eager kisses along her nude body and only paused to take a breast into his mouth.
She arched her back into his touch and felt her pussy dampen with need.
She was glad she had been naked this entire time, otherwise she'd have ruined the pair of panties she walked into the club with.
"It feels like you're devouring me, Malcolm," she said breathlessly.
He pulled away from her nipple, giving it a quick flick with his tongue as he looked up into her eyes.
His lips pulled into an impish grin.
"Of course I am--you taste much better than the lobster.
I'm going to eat you alive."
She tilted her head back and lifted her hands to run her fingers through his hair.
She could feel him kiss down her stomach and it made the muscles quiver slightly.
His lips traveled past her navel and she could feel the cool wetness of his lips brush against the top of her mound.
"Will you kiss me?"
she asked hesitantly.
"Down there?
I've been waiting for this all night."
He laughed as his tongue brushed up against her clit.
"Then a few moments longer isn't going to kill you."
She gasped as she felt his warm mouth enclose around her clit.
Tingles flooded through her entire abdomen when he began suckling at her nub, and her pussy quivered with insatiable need.
She wanted him more than she had wanted any man before.
It thrilled her and terrified her all at the same time.
She worked for so hard and so long that she never had time for anyone besides Chloe in her life.
Although she would never admit it to herself, Victoria was starved for a bit of human touch and affection.
Malcolm's intensity swept her away and made her forget all about her job.
Now, she just wanted to be submerged in the ocean of pleasure he was giving her.
"More," she pleaded as she bucked her hips.
"Consume me."
She could feel her orgasm building in the small of her back and it threatened to explode like a nuclear blast.
"I'm so close."
He began to attack her clit more fervently, massaging his tongue across her flesh.
She couldn't control her hips anymore.
They writhed on their own accord, driving her body deeper against his face and increasing her pleasure tenfold.
Her legs trembled and her chest heaved with each breath.
His hands slid down to either side of her labia and spread her lips open wide.
He continued to suckle on her clit as he dipped a finger into her swollen pussy, liberally coating it with her wetness.
She cried out and bucked her hips against her hands as she felt a second finger penetrate her pussy.
"That feels amazing," she moaned.
He smiled softly as he pulled away and guided her over onto her stomach.
Deftly, he lifted her to slide a pillow under her hips, causing her ass to be thrust upward into the air.
It made her feel deliciously exposed, and she glanced over her shoulder to see that he was carefully observing her displayed rear.
"Enjoying the view?"
she asked coyly.
"Very much so," he said as he lowered his chin to bury his face between her thighs.
She could feel his nose penetrate her folds as his tongue ravished her clit.
Being in this position made every sensation feel more intense, and even his breathing sent shockwaves of pleasure coursing through her body.
She rocked her hips across his tongue, begging him for more attention.
"God this feels amazing," she moaned.
"You taste so fucking good," he said as he eagerly lapped up her juices.
Victoria sighed softly at the sensation.
"What do I taste like?"
"Ambrosia," he said without hesitation.
She was too mesmerized by his choice of words to respond, but she didn't have a chance to think of a witty comeback before he was sucking on her clit again and robbing her of all logic.
His fingers grasped her ass and massaged her flesh, spreading the cheeks apart.
Blood was rushing to the area, bringing it all to life.
When his fingers probed and easily slid into her puckered asshole she lifted her head and cried out loudly.
"Malcolm!"
she shouted in protest, but she found herself pushing her hips back against his hand curiously.
"Be careful," she whispered with a gasp.
As if to respond to her, he continued to tease her clit with his tongue.
He slowly rotated his finger in her ass until she could feel the burning in the tightness of her hole.
The mild pain mixed with the pleasure his tongue gave her, creating a delicious combination.
Her body began to buck without her consent, and it was more than she could take.
The dual stimulation caused her orgasm to erupt through her body like a tidal wave.
Her toes curled and she unleashed a scream so high-pitched that she couldn't believe it was coming from her own throat.
As her pleasured ebbed, she felt her ass clench around his finger.
He continued to slide his finger in deeply, and she could feel a second massaging more of her moisture into the area before also prodding her for entry.
She wanted to protest but she found that she was unable.
She didn't want him to stop.
The pleasure overwhelmed her senses, and she began to press her hips back against his hand.
"That feels amazing, Malcolm," she admitted breathlessly.
"I'm going to fill this pretty little asshole with my cock," he said with hunger in his voice.
Her ass tightened around his fingers, aching to be filled even more.
"No," she said weakly.
"Then you won't be getting any cock tonight, Victoria," he said smoothly.
She looked over her shoulder with narrowed eyes.
"Don't tease me, Malcolm," she said with flames in her voice.
"It's obvious that you want me just as much as I want you."
She was getting sick of his games.
"I do," he said darkly, "but on my terms."
He continued to slowly drive his finger into her ass.
Her body shuddered in pleasure; as much as she wanted to deny that this felt good, she couldn't.
