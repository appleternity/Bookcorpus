The properties of the items that are included in the collection may be specified by the Item_Property.  Sometimes the Subtypes themselves are described by some Type_Property.

The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'  'Endill heard the noise of glass smashing, plaster crumbling and furniture being broken.'

'Lee breathed the hot desert air.'"}, {'frame': 'Level_of_force_exertion', 'tfidf': 1.3997020721435547, 'lexical_unit': 'power.n / weak.a / weakness.n', 'definition': 'An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

There are still some Fae that wish harm upon the human realm, but that is a different story."
He took a breath.
"Once you re-enter the Fae realm, the portals take off your glamour and you are your true form, your true self in the realm.
Very strong Fae can manipulate the glamour once inside the human realm to change only certain aspects of their looks, but for the most part the blanket stays in place."
"So, you look different in the Fae realm?"
"Not a lot different, no.
I am able to manipulate so I don't look too different."
"So wait, will I look different when I go to the Fae realm?"
"Yes, you will.
The change will probably seem very dramatic to you because it's your first time, but also because not only did the portal of the Fae realm coat you with glamour, I am quite sure your parents have a protection glamour set about you as well, so you are harder to detect to other Fae within the human realm."
She could only nod as she digested all of this information.
What would she look like?
Not that she was overly beautiful now or anything, but to look different, would just be... well... different, and unnerving, and just plain weird.
To get used to a face in the mirror for almost eighteen years for it to then change.
It would just be wrong.
As if sensing her distress Loki chuckled.
"No need to worry, it will be nothing dramatic.
You won't gain hideous warts or sixteen toes or anything like that."
She grumbled, but was secretly happy about that tiny speck of reassurance.
There were still so many questions that she had, and she still wasn't even sure if she believed all of this or not, but a small part of her wanted to believe it.
She wanted to believe that there was something more for her out there.
A reason why she was gifted with this so called "magic".
To be part of something bigger, something that wouldn't consider her a freak.
Something that would welcome her "gifts" or "powers" or "magic" and she would no longer need to panic and stress about saying the wrong things all the time.
But right now the biggest thing gnawing at her was the fact that her parents may not be her parents at all.
Her real parents may be out there in another realm somewhere.
And why did they give her up?
Did her "adopted" parents even know that she wasn't theirs?
Was she some changeling child or something?
She'd heard about that in Fairy tales before.
Was there a human child in the Fae realm that she was supposed to be?
If so, did they have the same questions as her?
She decided instead of letting it gnaw at her insides, she'd ask Loki this simple question.
Be damned if it was not his place to tell her the whole tale.
He owed her this much.
"I'm not some changeling child or something?
There's no human child on the other realm that I took the place of, right?"
His laugh was deep, rich and came from deep within his gut.
It was so unexpected.
She liked the sound.
Damn him!
"What a silly human story that is!
The Fae are much too proud of their bloodlines for such things as that."
Well, that was something at least, but it raised a bigger question.
If that were the case then why had her, supposed Fae ruler parents, given her up?
They reached her SUV far too soon.
She kicked at some pebbles in the parking lot.
She was so confused.
Her whole life had been thrown for a loop.
"So, we'll discuss a strategy for your entry into the Fae realm later this week.
Get some rest, digest all of this.
I'm sure you'll have more questions for me."
"Hey, do you have like a cell number or something?"
She'd never ever asked a guy for his number, and it seemed so awkward but heck how else could she communicate with him?
He shook his head.
"Typically the Fae do not use cell phones.
We have other modes of communication.
Don't worry about getting a hold of me right now; I won't be far away if you really need me.
I will see you in school tomorrow."
With that he turned on his heel and disappeared back into the forest.
She looked around, but didn't see his pickup.
He must have parked it elsewhere.
She thought that odd, but her mind was so cluttered with everything else that had been said today that the thought slipped her mind almost instantaneously.
Chapter Eleven  ....
Loki ....
He really hoped the King was prepared for his daughter.
She was blunt, stubborn, and willful.
She was also beautiful, smart and witty.
He'd seen bits of her humor and wit when he'd given her a ride home, she was quite the spitfire.
Something he wasn't entirely pleased about.
She flustered him.
She threw him off track.
He'd wanted to ask her about her powers in a much more easy and subtle way, but with her firing odd questions at him; it had him losing all of his focus.
All he knew was that he needed to get her up to speed, and to the Fae realm as quickly as possible, before he screwed something else up.
He didn't always do things flawlessly, but he'd never felt any kind of connection to any of the other retrievals he'd ever dealt with.
She was the daughter of his King.
He personally had been trusted with her safety and her speedy arrival to Faerie.
He tried to tell himself that was the strange connection he felt towards her.
Perhaps he was taking this mission too much to heart.
It was no use continuing to think about how he could have handled things better, he needed to do this at her pace.
He'd get nowhere forcing anything on her.
She was far too stubborn for that.
He'd done the first step; given her all the basic information he could.
Now he needed to wait for her to process it all, and then be ready to take the plunge and go with him to Faerie.
Sighing, he swung his sword and cut it down and across in a sweeping arch.
Keeping in form was important to him, so he continued to practice solo or with one of his agents every day after the human school was out, leaving Sorryn to watch over the Princess.
At school and at night she was his responsibility, for the few hours after school was his time to unwind.
His time to take a breath from the agonizing plight of dealing with human school, hormonal and selfish teenagers, and the growing connection he was feeling for this girl that was his mission, his King's daughter, his Princess and the promised of his brother.

....
Adeila ....
When she returned home, her mother was making some kind of skillet dinner from a frozen package.
Adeila studied her mother for several moments.
The woman was short, slightly plump in the middle and backside, with vibrant dark red hair and lovely deep brown eyes.
Her skin was pale as porcelain and she had tiny plump fingers.
Adeila looked nothing like her parents, at least not in the recognizable way her siblings did.
She had very light brown hair bordering on dark blonde with natural lighter tones, ice blue eyes, naturally olive tanned skin and a tall, willowy frame.
Even her face was different, she had high cheekbones and a kind of heart shaped face set off by the dark lashes surrounding her eyes and slightly overly full lips.
Now that she knew the possibility that they weren't her parents she was determined to find some kind of resemblance, but that was an epic fail.
Not a single thing about herself could be traced to her parents.
Nothing.
Maybe she'd try a new tactic.
"Hey, Mom."
Adeila's mother, Kathryn Burton jumped and looked back at her, one white ear piece in her ear, the other dangling down her chest, attached to a tiny music player inside a band on her arm.
"Sheesh, Adeila.
Way to scare ten years off my life."
"Sorry, thought you knew I was here.
I've been sitting here for like ten minutes."
Kathryn just went back to her stirring.
Adeila almost left right then and there, because clearly her mother didn't give a crap, but she was determined to get something out of the woman.
She let out a small sigh and steeled herself.
"Can I ask you something?"
Her mother barely turned her head, so that Adeila could easily see the look that clearly said not really, but if you must.
Fine, Adeila thought, you can just suffer through this.
Her mother took a sip of red wine but didn't even turn around to face her.
"How was my childbirth?"
Kathryn sputtered and nearly choked on the wine.
"What?
Why would you ask that?"
"Just curious, is all.
Some class thing."
"Well, you were my first born.
So it was long and painful."
And that was it, all she'd get, she knew it.
"How many hours?"
Her mother seemed to think and said, "Fifteen."
What else could see ask?
"Which hospital again?"
"Sacramento General, just like your brother and sister.
Why don't you let me finish the dinner you likely won't eat, please?"
And there, that was it.
All she'd get.
Most mothers would have loved embarrassing their child with details of their birth.
Nope, not her mother.
Adeila made her way upstairs to her room.
She had pages to read and a paper to write.
She took off her coat, then her sweater.
When her sweater came off something white came floating off of it.
A feather.
It was white with silver and speckled a dark brown.
The Gyrfalcon.
That was odd; she hadn't seen a feather land on her.
She picked it up and twirled it around her fingers.
She looked around, ran a hand through her hair, then put her sweater and jacket back on and grabbed her school books.
She just couldn't handle the confides of her room right now.
She felt stifled; smothered by the four walls.
Strangely she felt the need to take the feather with her.
She found a barrette and clipped it into her hair, not caring how unsanitary it was.
After two hours of reading and homework, she sat Indian style in a chair looking out into the back yard.
The sunset had already painted the sky in pinks and yellows and now darkness crept in all around her.
