Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

You believed in me then..."
"It was easy."
"You were the only one..."
"Their loss..."
"Well...
I never forgot... when things would be bad...
Your faith in me kept me going."
"Wow, Peg...
I never knew..."
"And...
I believe in you now..."
He pulled her close.
Their lips met with an ever increasing heat.
It grew from a sweet smolder in a roaring volcano.
He moved his mouth to run them down the side of her neck.
She called his name and pulled his mouth back to hers.
Their tongues tickled each other and danced a wild tango in and out of each other's mouths.
He broke free from her kiss and dropped his mouth to her breast.
Her back arched as he licked and then drew the hardening stub of flesh into his hungry mouth.
"Oh, my God...
Oh, Freddy..."
He smiled as he moved farther down.
His mouth followed the trails blazed by his hands.
The silk turned to fire.
The fire turned to thunder.
The thunder roared in both of their ears until years of sadness was burned from them both.
They slept the sleep of new lovers.
Only the warmth of a well banked fire remained as they lay exhausted under the stars.
The moon paid them no attention as it passed across the midnight sky taking its silver light.
It set beyond the bobbing ship unnoticed by the sleeping lovers.
They awoke once more before the sunrise.
This love was slow and gentle.
This meal of love was savored.
They knew when they slept that, this time, they had loved each other well.
They had spent the coins of love, spending them in shared passion in the darkness.
The last thing they both thought before they slept was that they were each happier than they had been in years.
Chapter 31; Sunday
In the gray light of pre-dawn, they woke in each other's arms.
After laying there enjoying the gentle rocking of the boat, Peg noticed something that made her very glad.
She pulled Fred close, "Is your friend back?"
"Yes..."
"Shame to waste it..."
So, they didn't.
When they had recovered their breath, she padded around the bed into the water closet.
After she was done, she looked out the tiny porthole.
She shrieked and ran back and jumped under the covers, "Holy crap!"
"What?"
"We're surrounded by senior citizens...
Heathen ones...
Don't they know it's Sunday!
They should be in church..."
"They worship at Our Lady of the Blue Shy..."
Fred laughed.
She had drawn the covers up over her head.
"Not funny..."
Fred went into the head to do his business.
He pulled on his cargo shorts.
Barefoot and shirtless, he went up the gangway.
He looked back at her looking like a small child with only her wild, blond hair and giant blue eyes outside of the covers, "You just let me handle this, Little Woman..."
"Oh, you!"
She threw an empty pop can.
It bounced off the door as he shut it behind himself.
He laughed all the way to the steering bridge.
He started the boat, got himself a soda while he was letting it warm up.
After a while, he guided the square vessel through the pack of fishing boat s that packed the little cove.
Once they were outside the cove and around a bend, he said, "You can come out now, Princess...
The mobs of your admirers have been left far behind in our wake."
He directed the boat out into deep water to avoid any other fishermen.
She came out dressed and looking around.
It crossed his mind to ask her what was underneath the dress, but, he thought that if he asked her, then, she might show him.
Then, they would definetly be late for church.
Instead he leaned down as she kissed him.
"Mmmmm..."
she said as she leaned her head on his shoulder.
He held her hand and the comfort that streamed between them was both a surprise to and healing for them both.
They stood like that as he brought the boat softly against the dock.
Peg jumped off and tied the back end as he went through the shutdown procedures.
Together, they tied the front and kissed again.
They went inside and took quick showers.
They dressed casually and headed for Teeny's.
Peg called ahead and ordered omelets and pancakes.
It was already on the table when they arrived.
Peg called, Hey, Papa..."
He waved to them through the kitchen window as Big Teeny brought two steaming mugs of coffee.
"Delilah okay?"
"That brand new grandbaby of mine be giving her the morning pukes...
She's layin' down out back..."
"Your magic juju tea didn't work, huh?"
"Oh, I made that whole magic juju story up for Miss Jeannie...
It's really just a powder of ground sasparilly root...
Sasparilly's good for settlin' the tummy on some people...
Believing is healing...
Now, that's from my granny!"
She walked away laughing a deep rumbling laugh.
"And the Jamaican juju thing?"
"More meddlin'...
My Jamaican granny been dead a long time...
Papa showed our Sheriff a good back rub for his wife... makes him feel not so helpless...
Gives him somethin' ta do..."
Fred laughed, "Whatever works, Mama..."
"This morning, I gave Little Teeny some boiled peppermint leaves and chinese black tea with dry toast...
It settled her to sleep...
It's been slow out here this morning, so, me and Papa, we got dis...
We'll try that sasparilly after her nap.
Fred called Greg, "All quiet?"
"Well...
Jeremy failed to do his duty again."
"Didn't hang himself, huh?"
"Nope... coward..."
"See ya in church?"
"Back row..."
"Roger that."
They headed for Eddyville.
In the gathering, Peg got busy showing off the ring to every female above the age of ten .
Fred shook hands with everyone as they congratulated him.
As the music started inside the chapel, people filed in and took their places.
Fred sat by Greg and Peg sat by Fred.
She leaned across him to show Jeannie her ring.
Greg looked down at it as her hand was mooned over by his wife.
"It's all downhill from here, Sergeant."
Fred laughed, "Roger that, boss...
I see how horrible things are for you...
Just couldn't let you go through it alone..."
They laughed and shook hands warmly.
"Roll call at 7..."
"Roger that!
Jimmy will be back, so, I'll catch Peg up..."
"Nah... bring him...
I been missing that munchkin..."
As they were leaving church, there was an equally long gauntlet of women and girls to show the ring to.
It seemed to take forever to make their way out of the old church.
The older women knew Gramma Eudora well.
Before she had passed, she had been one of the great ladies of the Mission's Guild.
Finally making her escape, Peg whispered to Fred, "Big City, I declare that I have never been so relaxed for Sunday service..."
"Go straight to hell...
Do not collect 200 bucks..."
"Oh, Freddy...
You are worth waaaay more than 200 bucks..."
he kissed her as he helped her into her side of the car.
The whole crowd outside of the church watched them kiss and broke into spontaneous applause.
Fred and Peg waved and drove out as quickly as they dared.
Chapter 32; Sunday PM; The Prodigal Baby Returns
When they pulled up to Peg's, there was a shiny pickup in the drive.
"He's home!"
Peg called as she ran into her house.
Fred hurried after her.
In the living room was a tall, dark man quickly going to fat around his middle.
He was reading Peg's paper and drinking a beer.
Peg was standing by the door looking stiff.
Fred couldn't tell if she was feeling angry or just uncomfortable.
