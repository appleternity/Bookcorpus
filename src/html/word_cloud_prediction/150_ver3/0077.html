This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

He stared down at her hands, which were wrapped around the small book and the wallet, which she held against her chest, hidden in the folds of her sleeves.
Finally she turned to him, asking his name and reaching into the wallet, and holding out to him coins in her left hand.
He grasped her hand.
Her breath caught.
He pushed back her sleeve.
An intricate ring shown on her third finger.
The hand that pushed back the sleeve bore the same ring.
The wallet and the book and the coins dropped to the ground.
Now the traveler pulled his hood back and she cried out as she met the blue eyes.
Eyes that held no threat.
"Margaret," he said, and it sounded like a song, with the lilt only he had to his voice.
Margaret was unable to believe her eyes or to speak or do anything.
Tamlyn knelt before her, wrapping her hand in his.
"Margaret, can you still be mine?"
Her eyes were blurring with tears.
She raised her crimped right hand and placed it over his, and nodded yes.
"Yours, Tamlyn," she squeaked, and the tears flowed, and he stood and his arms were around her, holding, as he whispered her name again and again.
She felt his body shake with silent sobs against hers, and she held him, digging her knuckles into his tunic, then relaxing.
Thus they stood for a length of time neither one could have said, for in each heart reeled shock, joy, bitterness, gratitude, and grief in a poignant overwelling.
When finally they leaned apart, neither knew where to begin speaking.
Margaret made the sign of the cross over him in blessing.
A throat cleared nearby.
She turned toward the almoner and the handmaid, who waited, the almoner patiently and the woman staring hard at Tamlyn.
"My lord my husband, Tamlyn Braewode, has returned."
She fought a moment to control her voice, the handmaid's hands flew to her mouth.
"Please go now and prepare his house for him.
Prepare him a feast, for he that was lost to us, is found!"
In a few moments they stood alone under the linden trees.
Margaret stared at him and softly touched his downy beard.
"You have not changed since we said goodbye, while I have grown older."
"Because I have been in the Faerie Realm.
But my heart has grown old mourning each day for you."
"I have grown in willfulness, and not in wifeliness."
"You have grown very much in God, while I have forgotten how to live amongst the sons of Adam.
I know not how to be a husband to you, either.
But, I am willing to learn."
"And I also..."
She warbled, dashing tears from her reddening eyes.
"I did not think you would ever return.
I was sure you must have died, but I couldn't believe it.
I would not let myself think of it...How long has it been, now?"
"Seven years.
Seven years I have served the Queen Galorian for that I killed her only son."
"Moruan?"
"Aye."
"Her son...How...Will you stay, now?
Can you stay here with me, please?"
He saw the misery in her eyes, and she in his.
"I am free to stay, and that is my one desire, if you will have me.
I pray that we may never part.
But, Margaret, I have not taken the sword for seven years, but have been a servant.
You married a knight, but I don't know if I can be that any longer.
What think you of that?"
She looked at him in the same tunic in which he had ridden off, much faded and frayed at the sleeve edges.
His beautiful hair had been shorn; his beard was still downy.
Only the eyes looked older, sorrowful.
"I have no heart to watch you ride away to war, not knowing whether you may return to me.
You married a noble lady who was very fond of finery and dreamed of going to court.
I don't think I can be that any longer.
What think you of that, Tamlyn?"
He regarded her unruffled linen dress, without adornment or jewels, only the gold chain she had always worn, the betrothal ring on her left hand, and the spare, transparent married woman's headdress.
"That you are more lovely without finery," he said, "With the ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God's sight, and mine."
They stood, their eyes searching, under the lindens with the wind rustling in their leaves, and a linnet chatting in the branches overhead, and the shadows of clouds sweeping the meadows and green hills beyond.
"Sievan, you came back to me," Margaret murmured; he reached for her and she came.
Fires long closely banked burned with unexpected brightness.
That afternoon and evening and night were not long enough.
Margaret hardly slept, for she watched him laying beside her within the embroidered curtains, the lamp flickering behind the fabric.
He slept as if too tired to live, yet woke with eyes bright, turning to her and reaching for her, long before the dawn came.
Realization dawned slowly upon them that at long last they were together as God intended, and they spoke little of the thousands of days apart, for a horror of them lay bound in the pit of each heart, until morning when Margaret found courage to ask him of his time in the Faerie court.
He spoke of things which seemed so wondrous to Margaret.
"But so many times the Queen would rather sit and listen to me tell of what she called, things which angels desire to look into.
For they are forever servants of the King, never sons, as we are..."
Tamlyn's voice trailed off.
When he again spoke, his voice was very low.
"Oh, Margaret--" he took her hand, buried his face in it.
"It was wrong...to bind myself again to them, when I belonged to you...to live as a bondman, when free...and I knew it, not long after I had sworn myself...to serve her, and leave you alone and undefended.
Oh, God, forgive me, Margaret..."
She wrapped her arms bruising-tight around him.
A tumult of questions Margaret had not allowed herself to ask answered each other in a seethe of accusations, wonders and sorrows.
He was asking her forgiveness.
All that stood between them now was within her.
Could she?
"How could I not forgive you, love, after all this?"
said she, but as if persuading herself.
"Shall I resent you for your faithfulness, after it is mine at last?
If you had remained with me and been my knight, God only knows whether I would have you alive now.
Come, love, let us forget what lies behind.
We have each other now, and I am thankful.
I am too tired of being lonely, of being sad and angry-- yes, angry, love-- I want to forget it all, and be your wife.
I have loved you too long in a void to stop loving you now that I have you here with me.
Kiss me, Sievan, and know that I promise to forgive you."
Margaret told Tamlyn that his father and mother both had passed away, and of the judgment of King Fearnon concerning his title.
"I have done nothing towards applying for widowhood, but I expect your brother will be here soon to expedite matters."
Tamlyn made no reply to this.
His head hung down.
"I have dealt with him, with his prodding and manipulations and demands and petitions, for years.
Where he finds the time to bother with me, I know not.
He has fulfilled every ambition your father held for him, and more--" "Then let him have what he wants.
I will let him have it all, if he will leave us alone.
God knows he deserves every bit of it, title and all.
I have been no kind of son to my father and mother, and now they are gone."
Margaret hung her head, shocked at her own thoughtlessness.
"I am so sorry."
After a time he looked up.
"I had known, somehow.
Two winters ago."
Margaret and Tamlyn regarded one another, the losses and shadows of the past drifting like smoke between their gazes.
"Are you bitter toward Coltram?"
The question found Margaret unprepared.
She turned her head away.
"I would have to confess that my heart struggles toward him."
The sun was fully up now, and a knock on the door of the bower was heard.
Willa opened the door and called in, "My lady, unless you need me, I shall go our rounds with the houseman..."
"Good, Willa, go with God.
I don't need you now."
The door shut quickly.
In the silence, Margaret leaned back against the carven headboard and wrapped her arms around her knees.
She gazed far away beyond the embroidered bedcurtains.
When she spoke, her voice was low and quavering.
"I had a foundling, a little girl.
We called her Sunniva.
She lived to three years old.
It was almost two years ago she died."
Tears fell freely, but Margaret dabbed at them indifferently.
"My little darling, she helped me to live without you, and..."
She took a deep breath.
"After the Lord took her to Himself, I couldn't-- I had nothing-- Coltram came then, for once he was very sweet.
He asked me if I would come nurse Jehanna, for she had had a fit after one of her headaches and fallen unconscious.
I went, just to get away from the silence and idleness here.
"I nursed her, but she never awoke and passed away.
Then I tried to arrange it with Coltram to care for their children.
At first he seemed to like the idea, but then he changed his mind and sent the bairns instead to your sister, Tamarlanne.
"When I came home here, I knew I had to take care of someone.
I cried out to God, wondering why He was taking everyone away from me.
On the way to Church I passed the house of old Darcy, an elder woman who lives alone.
I looked in on her and she was ill, so I stayed and nursed her.
She begged me to see to another woman down the lane.
Darcy put out the word and soon I went nowhere without people begging me for remedies.
Many I could help, many I could not.
I hadn't realized how I missed having many people around me, for at Caer Aldene one was rarely alone.
"So I buried myself in that for a while, but I found myself more and more seeing the needs of their souls, for which my salves and poultices and potions could do nothing.
I found myself reading Gospel to them, asking them about their lives.
I saw their anguish and longed to see them born anew of God, with the hope and peace He gives.
Soon a crowd was gathering at sickbeds, for the spectacle of a Lady preaching and nursing, I suppose.
People espying at windows and doors, children hiding under beds to hear.
"Last year was a bad year for crops, and those who rented my fields near the River had their wheat and oats washed away, it was so wet, and all the crops were poor, even the fruits.
I bought grain from the west, and began to dole it out.
One morning as I prayed I remembered that Jesu is the Bread of Life, and I could feed their souls with that.
So I began...Well, some have called me Lady Preacher, though I like it little...The Word says women ought not to teach, but I must speak that which He gives me to say."
She looked at Tamlyn, who had risen to sitting on the bed.
