The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

"I told you, before we access the docking ring, we need to create a distraction."
"So what's two levels down?"
"The shielded central server room."
"How the hell are we going to get into there?
This may be a crappy backwater world, but I'm assuming that server room is going to be protected."
"You forget who I am."
"No, I haven't, and that's the point.
We've already done far too much.
People will be questioning exactly what I am."
This time there was no pause.
"Crown Prince Andalusia, I am programmed to keep you safe.
This is the only way."
"But if you hack into that server room, people will wonder--" "Andalusia," he said, his tone direct and comforting, "this is the only way.
Let me guide you, Your Highness."
Just as she made it down the side of the ramp, and the massive central tower opened out above and below her, she squeezed her eyes closed, a few tears trickling down her cheeks.
It didn't take her long to open them.
This was hard, granted, but with Veri, she would get through it.
For the alternative was unacceptable.
Chapter 12 Saz Sommers Saz didn't have to fall the several-kilometer distance to the ground level of the city below.
He made it through three lanes of traffic until his back slammed hard against the hull of a passing ship.
It was such a hard impact, he immediately felt the hull dent with the perfect shape of his body.
Immediately, he heard an alarm vibrating through the ship, warning its occupants of the impact.
Despite the fact most of the sophisticated skills of his armor had been switched off, at least it had protected him from the fall.
His head wasn't spinning.
Instead, it was as sharp as a knife.
He knew exactly what he had to do.
Back when he'd first seen that footage of that woman - her deadly elegance, her swift efficiency - his gut had told him she would be key.
And his gut had been right.
She possessed the kind of technology that could hack through a Xantos Guard's armor.
The stuff Saz was wearing wasn't the stuff they gave to the ordinary guards, either.
His was top-of-the-line.
And yet, somehow she had hacked through his security protocols.
She was an assassin.
She had to be.
But he doubted she was going after Dalia.
She'd be here for Veta.
Saz could not access his communication unit.
He could barely move his body as he pushed himself up, grinding his hands into the hull of the transport as it came to a security stop.
There were lighting strips along the roof, and they started to blink a specific red that would tell other passing ships the transport was in trouble.
Saz didn't let out a groan as he finally made it to his feet.
Despite the fact it was taxing and he had to fight against the weight of the armor, he tilted his head up, immediately turning it in the direction of the central tower to his left.
He could no longer see that hoverbike.
It would be out there, though, and his instincts told him it would be heading to the central tower.
Andalusia was in danger.
It took his addled brain a moment to correct himself.
Wrong Princess.
Veta was in danger.
He had time to shake his head before a hatch a few meters behind him opened.
He twisted on his foot as he watched two surprised maintenance staff clamber out.
They were in basic magnetic armor.
Enough that they could lock onto the metal hull, but not the kind of stuff you could take into space.
They took one look at his Xantos armor, and he watched their eyes boggle.
"I need to use your communications system, now.
I also need you to take me to the central tower, now," he growled even louder.
They stared at him, and it took him a moment to realize that his voice hadn't been relayed.
"Dammit," he snarled as he laboriously brought up a hand, jamming his thumb and pinky finger into two specific spots underneath his helmet.
It was the manual release, and it was only a position known to those who'd ever worn this stuff.
Usually, if the armor was in operational order, an enemy could accidentally slide their fingers along those two points, and it would do nothing.
It would take the wearer's permission for the helmet to open.
Now it was the last system that worked.
His helmet receded, a small cloud of atmosphere quickly shifting out before it was taken by the wind and dispersed in a split second.
His short blond hair was flattened over his face as he tilted his head to the side and out of the direction of the wind.
"Are you okay?"
one of the maintenance staff stuttered.
"I'm fine," he lied.
"But I need immediate access to your communication systems.
I also need you to take this ship to the central tower, now."
"We're not licensed to dock at the central tower--" "This is a critical incident.
You will deliver me there.
And you will give me access to your communications."
Saz didn't modulate his voice, and he certainly didn't say please.
It was one thing giving orders to the security staff of this planet when he only had his gut instinct to go on.
Now he had all the evidence he required that that pirate runner was an immediate threat to the Xantos Royal family.
He could take his kid gloves off now.
Which would be great, if only he could take his real gloves off, too.
It would be too dangerous to start disassembling his armor until he was out of this wind.
He took a laborious step forward, his weight denting the hull more.
One of the maintenance staff winced but didn't tell him to stop.
Both men held the hatch open until Saz finally made it over.
He didn't climb down the small ladder to the corridor below, and rather jumped, again denting the metal.
The Xantos Empire could pay for repairs once this incident was resolved.
"Patch me into the comms," he barked.
Thankfully neither of the men questioned, and a few seconds later, one of them handed him a small communication device.
It didn't take Saz long to figure out how to use it.
Unlike most of the other soldiers under his command, he always kept an eye on modern technology, even if it was more basic than the stuff the Xantos Empire had.
You had to know what was out there in case - just as had happened now - you were separated from your own technology.
So it didn't take Saz long to program in the communication frequency of one man.
Vandel.
All thoughts of having a fight with Vandel had fled Saz's mind, and as soon as he heard the comms stream open, Saz's shoulders deflated.
"There's an ongoing incident.
There's an assassin headed your way."
Saz didn't even take a breath as he pushed out his words.
Vandel could always play things one of two ways.
He was hardly a relaxed man.
He was too efficient for that.
But he had two distinct states.
Things were either a threat, or they weren't.
When they weren't, he would shut down.
When they were?
He'd turn into a soldier more fearsome than Saz.
There was a pause.
"We've got our own incident going on here.
Something crashed into the tower 100 floors down.
We're--" "What?
What crashed into the tower?
Was it a hoverbike?
A woman riding a hoverbike?"
Saz snapped.
"Yes.
Is that the assassin?"
"Yes."
Saz's voice was shaking with emotion now.
"I'm onto it."
Saz picked up the sound of Vandel's breath changing as the man no doubt pushed into a run.
"Where's the Princess?"
Saz demanded.
"Lady Veta is currently in the function room with Senator Dalia going over the details of the deal.
Five contingents of guards are with her."
Saz didn't even pick up the fact he'd accidentally called Veta a Princess when she was technically still just a Lady.
She would only become a Princess when Andalusia died and her powers as the head of the Xantos Empire transferred to Veta.
On any other day it would be a massive faux pas to confuse the names.
Today, Saz ignored it as he brought up a gauntleted hand and thumbed the sweat off his brow.
"Get to her now."
"Which her?
The Princess or the assassin?"
Vandel clarified.
Vandel would know the answer.
He knew perfectly well how Saz thought.
Even if most of the other soldiers on Veta's protection detail didn't understand Saz's reasoning, Vandel always had, and that was likely the only reason the two unmatched men had become friends.
"The assassin - any news on where she's headed?"
Saz demanded.
"Current security footage suggests she's going down, but the footage seems to be unreliable."
"I don't know what she's got on board, but she can hack through anything."
"What?
Where are you, anyway?"
"I'm currently in locked-down armor on a transport vessel.
She hacked into my armor," Saz said as he took a steadying breath, pushing that statement out with a slight waver to his voice.
It brought him back to the fact that this woman was unlike anything he'd ever seen.
Technically it was possible to hack through Xantos armor, but you would either have to have inside knowledge of the security codes, or prototype technology and some insane skills.
There was a long pause.
"What are we dealing with?"
"I've got no idea.
But if she's got that kind of technology, you're going to have to upgrade your armor set."
"Got it.
Are you en route?"
"I'll get there in five minutes.
Stop her."
There was no hesitation as Vandel spat out, "Yes, sir."
The feed cut out, and Saz stood there, staring at the wall in front of him.
He flicked his gaze toward the two maintenance staff who were still standing close by.
