In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

I yell.
"Leave him alone!
Don't you hurt him!"
I shout as blue Ult L-E intensifies and flares from my eyes like angry electrical waves.
I grow desperate as I lean against the couch, waiting for a chance to react.
No matter what, I have to save the boy even if it cost me my life.
I think of Preacher and my heart calls for my beloved as determination growls within me like a hungry tigress stalking a herd of antelope.
I'll soon sink my teeth into the Un-Men and annihilate them all!
They won't hurt anybody here.
I swear it!
Chapter Twenty-five In A Bad Spot 9:32 A.M...
Melissa Odin's safehouse...
Katharine's view...
Don't hurt Chad!
Don't hurt him!
He's all I have left.
I cover my head, lying face down on the floor as the other Un-men fire at me.
God, don't let him get hurt!
I can't lose him, not after Preacher.
I manage to peer around the couch again and see the two Pretty Boys marching towards Chad as they lift their guns and state, "Wound the boy so we may capture him."
"No!"
I yell again.
"Run, Chad!"
"The monsters!"
he mumbles unable to move for fear.
"They're the orange-eyed monsters!"
This isn't the first time he has met these nightmares.
I had hoped when I left him and Preacher, he would never have to see them again.
I should have never come here.
I should have listened to Kimberly and never gone to the funeral.
The three T-2s move on my position and speak with a South African accent, "There is no place for you to go, Pandora.
Surrender and we will take you alive."
I see a metal bat by the TV, so I crawl to it, grab the bat, and jerk the two game controllers from their connection to the game console.
I won't let anyone else die.
I'll save Chad.
I feel the Ultra-Epi surge through my body as I stand, and I see the glow of the blue Ult L-E as it flashes off the floor and reflects my determination.
I quickly throw the first controller at the T-2s and the second controller at the T-1s, and then I duck behind the couch, peer over it, and watch as they both strike their mark.
The first controller hits a T-2 in the brow, and the second controller strikes a Pretty Boy in the back of the head.
I stand again and take a few steps back from the couch as the two Pretty Boys turn from Chad, glance at the controller, and move towards me.
"No," one orders the other.
"Complete our other task first.
We must take the boy."
On the other side of the room, the three T-2s look at the controller at their feet and ask me, "What do you plan on gaining by attacking us with such a weapon?
You can not damage us with-" I run, step to the cushions, and leap over the couch as a tigress would leap over a fallen log once the chase for dinner began.
I rush the T-2s with the bat held high as if it's my claws, and then I swing.
They look up just as I swing, and I hit two of them.
The one closest to the front door takes the brunt of my attack, and I dent its metal skull near its left temple, impacting part of its automaton brain.
Black liquid trickles down its face, it drops a 9 mm magazine it held while reloading, and collapses to its knees.
Its body flails as power surges through its systems.
My attack also damages the second T-2's left robotic eye, and sparks shoot from the marred area as the mechanical sphere hangs out of its socket and dangles by a few wires.
The eyeball continues to move and look at me.
I glance at Chad as the two Pretty Boys turn toward him, and I yell, "Run!"
I helplessly watch as his lips quiver in terror and he remains petrified in place.
My heart sinks, fearing for the boy.
No matter what, I'll protect him as if he's my own cub.
One Pretty Boy states to the other, "Shoot him in the leg."
The two functioning T-2s insert a new magazine in their guns and say, "If you will not surrender, Pandora, then we must destroy you!"
"Chad!"
I shriek as I start for him, but then I hear the T-2s reload their guns and turn, swinging backward with my bat at the third T-2's head as if I'll claw off its face.
It catches the bat with its hand and states, "Your tactic will not work a second time."
The first T-2 with the damaged automaton brain powers down and reboots, and I sense that it has by-passed the impaired areas of its processor and then it powers back up.
It stands but has lost use of its left side.
The T-2 holsters its gun, unable to reload the weapon with only one arm as the third T-2 snatches the bat away from me and swings it.
I duck, grab the magazine the first T-2 dropped, and roll away from the T-2s.
The third and second T-2 open fire on me as I duck around the end of the couch.
They cease fire, and white particles from the couch's padding float in the air around me.
Stephanie's view...
I stand in front of the kitchen door and watch Pandora while the gun battle takes place.
As the carnage goes on around me, I realize another like myself exists.
Pandora's amazing!
I have to fight her.
She'll give me the challenge I've been waiting for, but the Council still has to give the order.
I almost can't wait.
She's like me, but only one of us can be the best.
I fist my hands, resisting the urge to attack her.
They have to give me the go ahead so that I can prove that I'm superior.
I've annihilated many opponents over the years and very few have given me any challenge.
Pandora, I believe, will be different; she is different.
She's like me.
I watch as the two T-1s lift their guns, taking aim not at Pandora but another.
The boy covers his face with his arms and cries out, and I snap out of my thoughts when I hear the boy scream.
For the first time since this battle started, I turn my attention away from Pandora and I look at the boy as the two T-1s aim for him.
A feeling comes over me, one I haven't felt in a long time.
It's panic.
They're about to hurt the boy and maybe even kill him, and...
"Chuck!"
I yell as I run and tackle him before the T-1s fire.
Katharine's view...
Before I can try and rescue Chad, the Pretty Boys fire and their bullets riddle the staircase.
I nearly die inside as I'm too late to save him, but then I see that Chad's fine.
He's more than fine.
He's safe.
The Pretty Boys cease their attack till they can identify the unknown woman who has run out in front of them.
Their programming, thanks to Kimberly, now prevents them from hurting civilians unless the Factory deems the individual expendable.
Stephanie shields the boy with her body as she turns and glares at the Pretty Boys.
The T-1s use their facial recognition software, and an alarm goes off inside their programming, identifying the woman as...
I lose my connection with the Pretty Boys.
They can't harm her because she's...
She's important somehow and...
I don't know why they can't destroy her.
The Pretty Boys turn to one another and search their programming for their next move as their current tactic has been barred.
I have to think fast.
I still have no gun, and they're too many people here for the Un-Men to use against me.
I really wish Kimberly was here.
I could use someone in a fight like this.
I look again to Stephanie as she protects Chad.
He's safe along with everyone else, and that's the most important thing at the moment, so I raise my hands and shout, "I surrender.
Don't shoot."
I stand from my position, unsure if they'll take me prisoner.
Stephanie's view...
I lift from the boy, kneel beside him, and quickly check to see if he's hit as I ask, "Chuck, are you fine?"
"Yeah, I think," he answers as he holds his bloody elbow where he scraped it on the floor.
"And my name's Chad."
He turns to me and asks, "What about you?"
"I'm fine," I reply when I'm satisfied he's not injured.
Katharine's view...
Andrews and Daniels stir and rise to their feet as the three T-2s focus on me, deciding my fate, and the T-2s state, "Take Pandora.
We will return to the Factory."
My heart slows, and my eyes lose their glow with the immediate danger gone, and the genetically altered adrenal gland ceases production of my Ultra-Epi.
The first T-2 limps to me, dragging its impaired left leg, then stops, and waves for me as it commands, "Come with me."
I walk toward it, trip on a cushion on the floor, fall forward, and catch myself on the injured T-2.
It helps me up with its good arm as it states, "Do not resist us."
I nod and put a hand behind my back.
The Pretty Boys join the other T-2s as the injured one escorts me to the couch.
The third T-2, the Team Leader of the five, turns to the Pretty Boys and informs them, "I cannot raise the Factory.
Try your I-Link."
The Pretty Boys' blazing orange dot-light blinks three times as they connect and after a few seconds, they reply in one accord, "We are also unable to raise the Factory.
What does protocol dictate?"
Stephanie's view...
I observe Pandora as the Pretty Boys move away from me and Chuck to join the others who have captured her.
I have a feeling the battle is way far from over and as much as I'd like to watch it play out, I better get the kid out of here.
"Come on," I tell him as I grab him by his uninjured arm and drag him towards the kitchen.
"Let's get out of here."
"What about Kat?"
Chuck questions me as he pulls in the opposite direction, stopping our escape.
"We have to help her!"
"Pandora can take care of herself," I tell him.
I notice Pandora tucks a gun into the back waistband of her pants.
She had grabbed the Un-Man's gun from its holster when she accidentally tripped and if I remember correctly, the gun's empty, so I have no idea what she's going to do with it.
I force the boy through the kitchen door.
Whatever she's going to do, I would like to see it.
I just have to get him to safety and then I can come back.
Katharine's view...
"There is no protocol set up for loss of communications with the Factory," the Team Leader states to the other four Un-Men around me.
"We must process this problem further."
It turns to the Pretty Boys and the second T-2 with the dangling eye, and then they connect through their I-Link and work the problem out together.
The injured T-2 orders me as it remains unlinked with its brethren, "Sit."
I sit on the couch and while its brethren work on the problem, the injured T-2 notices Andrews and Daniels are on their feet and going for their weapons.
"Leave the guns holstered," it commands.
"Do it, and it'll ignore you," I tell them.
