The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

"Is something wrong?"
Shelley asked.
"I could have sworn you were wearing a pink shirt not red," She shook her head,"gotta lay off the booze."
"I would like the biggest greasiest burger you have, and a large order of French fries," I said.
"Ya me too, and two glasses of wine," said Shelley.
Maggie poured two large glasses of wine for us after ordering our food, I took a sip and felt an immense sense of relief.
I no longer had to worry about the plague or barbarians attacking us.
"We now have simple problems, like how to find stuff in our library," Shelley said.
Maggie was wiping down the bar near us, "can't find anything huh?"
"Oh ya... we got so many books."
"Don't know if it'll help but I know a little bit about searching for things."
"Really?"
I said.
"You know that search site STRUDEL?"
"Of course everybody uses it now," Shelley said.
"Well last year one of the company's founders was in here, it was the day of the company IPO, I think he had just become a billionaire."
"So did he tell you the secret of his program," Shelley said jokingly.
"Funny you should ask, it's a long story if you want to hear it?"
We were both instantly curious, "yes," we said in chorus.
"Well for starters I don't think he drinks normally, you can always tell because when teetotalers do drink they get super bombed, and he could barely walk.
Anyway he staggers up to the bar and slams down a hundred dollar bill."
"Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey," he said.
"I think you've had enough," I said.
He slammed down another hundred, "do I look thirsty enough now?"
"Sadly my rent was due so I couldn't afford the scrupulous morals I usually have, so I gave him his booze."
He drank his shot then said, "I'm a goddam billionaire...
Jesus...
I really am..."
he had a strange look of disbelief on his face.
"I have heard everything being a bartender and I normally don't pay much attention to drunks, but it was slow and he obviously had money, how'd you make it?
I asked him."
"You know... they're always talking about supercomputers... supercomputer this... petaflop that... you know they've been trying for thirty years to get a computer to tell the difference between a cat and a dog."
"That's an important problem?"
"Um... no... but a two year old kid can do it."
"So what does that mean?"
"It means the real supercomputers are sitting between peoples ears."
"So how did that make you rich?"
"He started giggling uncontrollably."
"All this internet shit... all of it... it's just a big network hooking all the real supercomputers together... once you realize that..."
"Ya but how did that make your money?"
"My search site... it's the people using it doing the searches... there ain't no goddam algorithm... everybody thinks there is but there ain't."
"Huh?"
"The old search sites they just ranked pages by how many times the keyword showed up and how many hits the page had... useless... you'd always get a page about crap you didn't want.
What you do is watch the searchers."
"How can you watch the searchers?"
"Think of a library... you're a librarian... somebody finds a book he wants... so you ask him, where he found it, why he wants it... where he's from, whatever.
Then you write the info down.
Then someone else comes in... and he's asking about a book with the same name... well you check you're database and voila now you know where it is... or if the same guy comes back and wants the book again."
"So your search page just keeps a database of people's searches?"
"That's the big secret... you let the suckers find everything... then you keep track of it and cross reference it with location and user addresses... so if someone is looking for the flaming donuts... in Seattle it might be a band... in New York a restaurant... and guess what else, all the shit nobody is looking for doesn't clutter up your database.
And you know the greatest thing...  once everybody uses my page no other page can ever be as good... cause my page will have the biggest database of searches, so it will work the best... so everybody will use it... so the database will get bigger... so everybody will use it..."
"He started laughing manically then and yelled...
Absinthe!
I need Absinthe...
I want the visions..."
"So you gave it to him?"
Shelley asked.
"God no...
I have some green food coloring for St Paddy's day so I gave him a shot of green water.
Anyway he downs the shot and his eyes went all crazy like," Maggie put her fingers next to her eye's and wiggled them," and then he says... there are powerful being's walking among us...
I've seen their searches... and then he passed out.
His entourage showed up five minutes later and took him away."
"Powerful beings, now that's crazy talk," Shelley said with a nervous laugh.
Maggie looked at her suspiciously.
"Hmm... so we need a librarian, a computer, and then we let the general public search our library," I said changing the subject.
"I could put an ad on the internet... meticulous nosy busybody needed, must have good computer skills and a degree in library sciences," Shelley replied.
"It might actually work... we could hire a security guard to make sure no one takes anything," I said.
"Geez... how many books you got?"
Maggie said.
Our food arrived then, I grabbed the large greasy burger and downed it like a jackal feeding on carrion.
It was the first meal I had had in a month that I didn't worry about getting a disease.
We spent the rest of the night at the pub drinking wine and keeping our eyes peeled for Clyver, we wanted to make sure he was not waiting outside.
A small band showed up and played folk songs with acoustic instruments, it attracted a small crowd of bohemians dressed in what looked like drab hand me downs.
They all smoked cigarettes furiously and drank large glasses of expensive imported beer.
One of them came over to talk to us, he was tall, skinny and his hair was jelled into a random series of spikes.
"So what brings you two fair maidens here tonight?"
He asked.
Shelley looked at me and rolled her eyes.
"We're hiding from a powerful enemy," I replied.
"Really?"
he said.
"Yes we have avoided battle this time... but we shall have to face him eventually," I took a dramatic gulp of wine.
"And why would he want to do battle with you?"
I could see a slight smirk in his expression.
"Because we have the orb of power..."
Maggie had gone on a break and the bar was empty except for us.
I touched the magic bracelet on my wrist and a glowing multicolored orb manifested itself about three inches above my upturned palm.
He stared at the orb his eyes wide in amazement, the orb then transformed into a tiny black dragon complete with flapping wings and fiery breath and then it disappeared in a flash of light.
"How'd you do that?"
he asked breathless.
"You must not talk about what you saw here tonight, or the dark riders will be after your soul too," I said menacingly.
He looked at us with a stunned expression then turned and walked away without uttering a word.
Shelley looked at me like I was crazy, "What the hell..."
I smiled at her, "like I said magic and wine are a bad combination."
Chapter ten
I woke up the next morning in my own bed with a hangover, I had a moment of panic, then relief when I saw the magic bracelet I had made at Hattu's complex sitting on my night stand.
I had another moment of panic when I remembered what I had done last night.
I sat up on my bed and looked at the sun coming through my window, it was already approaching its zenith.
I showered and dressed and then walked to the kitchen to get the largest cup of tea I could possibly make.
I saw Shelley sitting on the couch in our living room watching TV.
"Nothing bad happened last night... right?"
I asked.
"Well... other than scaring the crap out of some random stranger no." "Oh God, that was stupid... that's why I never bring my bracelet with me.
I have a mischievous spirit living in me that is freed by alcohol."
I poured boiling water into a large cup with a tea bag in it, I walked over to the couch and sat down beside Shelley.
"Well... don't feel too bad, I've woken up in bed a guy I didn't know before," Shelley said.
"Yes... it's not like I destroyed a city with a pillar of flame... now that would be bad."
I saw Shelley's eyes narrow as she turned her head and stared at me, I smiled back innocently.
"What was up with that spell?
It was pretty cool," Shelley said.
"I found it in one of Hattu's spell books, he also wrote a bunch of similar spells, they are all basically sophisticated automatons , they don't really have any use."
"Other than terrifying some geeky beatnik."
"I stored all his spell books in my bracelet, I'll dump them in my workshop so you can look at them."
"It's ironic that such a powerful sorcerer died of old age," Shelley said.
"I can think of few ways around death... but it would not be good for my Ka, besides as you now know things of infinite abundance have little worth."
"What about Maggie's idea for finding stuff in our library?"
"I think that would be a great project for you... you would have to write some pretty sophisticated spells."
"God...
I didn't realize project management was part of sorcery."
"If you really want to create great spells, you have to organize teams, delegate the writing and constantly fix problems.
I had lots of great idea's I just gave up on because they would have taken too long."
"Like what?"
"I was going to make a sort of collective intelligence using a matrix of people in time and space, but it got to confusing and the math was way beyond my capabilities, it didn't help that the zero hadn't been invented either."
"You could farm that stuff out to some grad student now... and use a computer to organize it," Shelley said.
"I try to stay away from clever people, they have a tendency to figure out stuff you don't want them too."
I sipped my tea as Shelley and I watched the TV in silence.
After my cup of tea and a long nap I felt much better, I told Shelley that I had an errand to do in the Magic City and that I would be gone for a few hours.
I had put on my magic bracelet and now used it to summon up a large bronze sword in a sheath.
I slung its strap over my shoulder.
"Expecting something?"
Shelley asked.
"Just being cautious."
"In all the adventure novels I've read the hero's swords have name's, does yours?"
Shelley asked.
I thought for a moment, "It's called my little friend," I said with a smile.
I said goodbye to Shelley and was on the wide flagstone paved streets of the ruined city in a few minutes.
I had walked around the city many times since Shelley and I had taken up residence here, but I had never gone more than a few blocks.
This time I started walking past the familiar area's and into the unfamiliar.
I noticed as I walked that there were subtle changes in the style of architecture, the further I walked the greater the change.
I stopped in front of a particularly impressive building and used my bracelet to conjure up a very high quality digital camera, I then conjured up a small metal platform as well and inserted the camera into it.
I stretched out my arm and then let go of the platform, it hung motionless hovering about three feet above the ground.
I stepped back and then used my bracelet to maneuver the platform remotely, I increased its altitude until it was a small black dot high in the sky I then caused the camera to take a series of pictures.
I lowered the camera and recovered it after a few minutes, I looked at the photographs it had taken on its large LCD display.
The city appeared to be much larger then when I had first lived in it, the photographs could not encompass all of it, the cities roads and pathways continued right up to the edge of the picture frame.
I used the cameras digital zoom to search the streets of the city and soon found what I was looking for, I used the building I was standing in front of as a reference and then plotted a route to my new destination.
I wrote down the route with a pen and pad of paper and then caused the camera to disappear.
I started walking towards my goal.
It was a small building compared to the edifices surrounding it, but it was still quite impressive.
It was constructed of limestone, with large columns lining the front.
There were shallow steps leading to the buildings entrance.
