The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

He's washing down some new corn pickers that were delivered yesterday.
Have a seat and I'll get him for you."
Kevin put his hand under my elbow and escorted me to a row of seats upholstered in fake leather just outside the row of offices.
I didn't really like being touched by the man, even in this polite, rather formal way, but I didn't see any way to get around it.
I took a seat and crossed my legs at the ankles, attempting to look as if I was willing to stay parked indefinitely.
"Be right back," he added and headed for a steel door that was labeled "Service Area."
As soon as I heard the door click, I jumped up and weaseled my way around the corner of the glass wall.
It only took a second to carefully extract the brown paper from its location at the bottom of a pile.
However, I was swiftly disappointed to find that it was only a wide torn edge from the top of a page.
I could see that it contained a date, May something, and without wasting any more time, I slipped it into the tote bag and raced for my seat in the showroom.
I made it just in time.
The metal door clicked open and Kevin and Tom appeared.
"Hello, Ms. Raven," Tom bellowed.
The man had one volume; I decided he must be partially deaf.
"Mr.
Teeter said I can take my break now, so I have a few minutes.
What can I do for you?"
"Hi, Tom.
Who knew that I'd see you so soon again?"
I chuckled.
"Why don't we go outside and talk."
I headed for the big automatic doors and Tom followed along.
I had already decided that I didn't want Kevin Teeter to hear anything at all about what I was really interested in.
When we reached my Jeep I turned to Tom and leaned against the hood.
I began, "I hear your mother is interested in local history."
"Who told you that?"
Tom shouted.
I quickly realized that any efforts to keep this conversation quiet were probably futile.
"Adele Volger," I admitted.
Given Adele's tone of voice, I didn't know if this would be a good or bad thing to confess to, but I really had no other options, since I didn't know enough people yet to make up a believable lie.
"That Volger woman!"
Tom did lower his voice to something more like a normal conversational level.
He probably thought he was whispering.
"Ma and her have had a feud goin' for years.
It's been hot fer so long I don't think either one of 'em knows how it began.
But that don't make no never mind to you."
"No, it doesn't.
Does your mother study local events?
Maybe old news, years that things took place?"
"She does for a fact.
Don't make no sense to me.
She's got a house full of books, and ol' newspapers, and pictures and enough stuff t' start a museum.
Maybe she will do jist that, someday."
"That's great, Tom.
Sounds like just the person I'd like to talk to.
Do you think she'd see me?"
"Hell, yes, ma'am... er heck, yes.
Don't mean to show you no disrespect."
"That's OK.
How can I reach her?
She doesn't seem to be in the phone book."
"Oh, she's there, the listin's still in my step-daddy's name.
She don't go by that no more, but never bothered to get the billing changed.
I'll give you th' number, and I'll draw you a map.
It's a hard place t' find, and she don't explain it any too well to strangers.
Don't know's a stranger ever visited her!"
"That would be great."
I started to dig around in the tote bag for a pen and paper, but of course, just because that's what I needed, there wasn't any.
And, I had to be careful not to damage that fragile strip of newsprint.
I sighed, "I don't seem to have anything to write with."
"Come intuh th' service center.
I've got plenty of pens and paper."
Not wanting to re-enter the building with my guilty booty, I opened the car door, tossed the tote bag on the floor, and then followed Tom back to the building.
Tom was right; the directions to Mrs. Baker's place, or whatever her name really was, were complicated.
Getting there would involve a lot of back roads I hadn't heard of yet, let alone seen, and they weren't all laid out in nice squares like the ones downstate.
Listening to Tom's tortured speech was difficult and the bursts at high volume were beginning to feel like a jackhammer against my brain.
The service office wasn't anything like the front offices with shiny glass and faux leather.
This space was dark, grimy and smelled of grease and sour grain.
If Tom's voice wasn't giving me a headache, the odor certainly was.
When I finally had a map with many scribbled notes, and enough branched or crossing lines on it to entertain a cryptographer, I escaped to the Jeep, hopped in and headed for home.
Now, I really was tired.
This day had gone on long enough, but I had a good outlook for a visit with Mrs. Baker.
Tom didn't want to call her just then.
He said she'd be taking an afternoon nap.
But he had promised to call her this evening, and suggested that I follow up with a call in the morning.
I was planning on a nice long overnight nap myself.
I hoped Tom's mother wasn't deaf too.
The shadows were lengthening as I pulled into my driveway and turned off the key.
I reached for the map and my tote bag, but the bag wasn't there.
Chapter 12
The tote wasn't on the floor or under the seat.
Just to be thorough, I looked in the back and under the seats again, knowing as I did so how silly that was, since I knew right where I had put it.
With a deep sigh, I headed for the house, fatigue settling heavy into my bones.
The loss had to be reported; my wallet containing my driver's license and credit cards was in the bag.
I tried to remember what else had been in there, other than junk, as I dialed the police station for the second time that day.
Again, Tracy answered the phone, but she didn't sound as crisp as she had in the morning hours.
The day had taken a toll on her as well.
"This is Ana Raven," I began.
"Ana, I've been thinking you might call, but I'm sorry to have to inform you that there's nothing I can tell you about the Sorenson case.
It's a county case anyway, but the body has been sent to the city.
We won't know much for a couple of days, even officially, and I can't discuss the case with you despite the facts of your involvement."
"Actually, I'm very interested in knowing more about Cliff's... um... demise.
But I'm calling to report a stolen purse."
"Yours?"
"Yes, a canvas tote bag with blue stripes and hard plastic handles."
"How odd.
You've had quite a day, Ana.
Where were you when it was taken?"
"Teeter's Farm Implements.
I foolishly left it in my car, and when I got home..."
Tracy cut me off.
"You need to call the Sheriff's Department.
Teeter's is outside of Cherry Hill village limits, and there's no possible link to allow me to handle this one.
They'll do everything they can, and they have lots more deputies than we do."
"Oh, OK."
I was disappointed, or tired.
Or disappointed and tired.
I had felt so connected with Tracy just a few hours ago, and now she seemed to be pushing me away.
"Let me know how it turns out.
I have to go.
Someone's just coming in the door."
"Sure, bye."
I had to look up the number for the Sheriff's Department, and I added it to my list beside the phone.
I hadn't really understood that my ties to the village were not official when it came to needing police.
My call was shuttled to a Detective Paul Peters, and I struggled for the next few minutes to recall what was in the bag in addition to my wallet.
None of the rest of it made a bit of difference, but the man wanted a complete list.
My patience was thinning, but I remembered fighting with an old copy of Women's Day, a bottle of vitamins (surely outdated), a cheap manicure kit, a bottle of glue, and a mini tissue pack.
My fingers had touched loose paper clips, some coins and rubber bands when I had tried to find my wallet at the diner.
Who could make sense of that mess?
Of course there was the newspaper strip.
I didn't mention that, it would have been too difficult to explain, and I was already feeling foolish enough.
Frazzling my last nerve, Detective Peters closed with a lecture about leaving valuables in an unlocked vehicle, and an admonition to call the credit card companies immediately.
As if I didn't know that.
Following that less-than-encouraging conversation, I realized it had gotten dark outside, and I was hungry again.
The kitchen in this old farmhouse is nothing more than adequate.
The house had been lived in up until the mid 90s, so the countertops are decent Formica, and the cabinets are modern, but no appliances were built in.
I'd bought a basic white stove, refrigerator and microwave, but nothing expensive.
I didn't plan on doing any entertaining for a long time, maybe never, and a fancy kitchen was lower on my list of priorities than a comfortable bedroom and living space.
I checked the fridge, and pulled out a beer and a tub of leftover spaghetti.
The spaghetti was spinning in the microwave and I was on my second long pull of the beer when the phone rang.
I reached for it with a sigh.
"Ana Raven here."
There was a pause, then a long raspy breath.
I snapped, "Who's there, please?"
I thought I was simply annoyed, but I heard a ragged edge to my voice.
"Old news... should be left... in the swamp, or you may find yourself... in too deep;" the voice was a genderless, harsh whisper.
"Who is this?
What old news?
Do you have my newspaper?"
I demanded.
After two more slow raspy breaths the caller hung up quietly--the effect was more eerie than an angry click would have been.
The microwave dinged and I jerked so hard that beer slopped all down the front of my jumper.
I checked the caller ID.
There was the number, with the local exchange.
How could anyone in this day and age think they could make an anonymous call?
An involuntary shiver ran up my spine.
Perhaps he or she thought it wouldn't matter if I could find out who they were later on.
Was it someone on a cell phone, someone standing on my porch, or parked out on the road?
I leapt to the light switch by the kitchen door and turned the overhead light off and the porch light on with almost one motion.
Keeping to one side of the door I surveyed the porch and then looked out beyond my Jeep.
