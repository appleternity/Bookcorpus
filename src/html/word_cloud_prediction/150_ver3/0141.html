Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year).

In both frames, such sentences should be tagged with the metaphor tag to differentiate them from literal sentences like "His eyes glistened with tears."  \'Her eyes glinted with hatred.\' \'I saw a light in her eyes at the mention of cookies.\' '}, {'frame': 'Weapon', 'tfidf': 1.3717498779296875, 'lexical_unit': 'handgun.n / strategic.a / pistol.n', 'definition': "A Weapon is an artifact created specifically to cause harm or damage.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

A sudden hammering on the bathroom door stops the creature in its tracks.
"Casey!"
"Caleb, help me!
There's something in here!"
The door flies open and ricochets off the tiled wall with a crack.
The creature is blasted back into the wall opposite as if by an invisible force, and it slumps to the floor unmoving.
Caleb takes my face in his hands and I grit my teeth as his panic sears through my skull.
"The door was locked.
Are you hurt?"
I stare at him blankly, unable to comprehend what just happened.
I try to look over my shoulder at the creature on the floor behind me, but Caleb's grip on my face is firm.
"Casey, can you move?"
How does he know?
Does Caleb know what this creature is?
I try to lift my arms but they are like stone, frozen in place.
I lift first one heavy foot and then the other, stamping a little until I can move them freely.
"Yes.
Yes, I can move."
"Good, come on.
It won't stay down for long."
The creature looks a lot less sinister now, it's enlarged head lolling against its chest, it's long, skeletal legs splayed out.
I can smell its rotten skin, the putrid smell of decay.
"You know what that thing is, don't you?"
Caleb ignores my question, as he leads me back into the corridor.
I hear a scream from somewhere inside the building and I think of Bria.
She went upstairs with Nick, what if she didn't get out?
I try to take off in the direction of the staircase, but Caleb grabs me around the waist.
"Casey, we have to go."
He starts to drag me in the opposite direction.
"What are you doing?"
I struggle in his arms as he half-carries me into one the of the science labs.
"We have to help them.
There could be more of those creatures."
"There's nothing we can do; I have to get you out."
He pulls me urgently across the room and pushes the fire exit open, setting off a shrill alarm that pierces the silence outside.
I take deep breaths, gulping in the cold, damp air.
"This way."
Caleb takes off across the lawn in the direction of the driveway and I have to jog to keep up.
I see the fountain, illuminated by tiny spotlights, and beyond that, the main gates that lead out onto the dark country lane.
The wind picks up suddenly and I hear a distant rumble of thunder.
"Where are we going?"
With a sudden surge of panic, I try to plant my feet into the wet grass, but I stub my toe, and I try not to cry out as Caleb continues to tug on my hand, seemingly oblivious.
I look back and see the rest of the school converged on the patio, huddled together under the ember glow of the heaters, but they are too far away for me to see if my friends are amongst them.
"I need to find my friends."
I try to peel Caleb's fingers away from my hand.
"We haven't got time for this, Casey."
He says, tightening his grip.
"Where are you taking me?"
Caleb turns and fixes me with an irritated stare.
Before I can stop him, he lifts me off my feet and hauls me over his shoulder like a ragdoll.
"I didn't want it to be like this," he says.
"But you're making it difficult."
"What are you talking about?"
I hammer my fists against his back, but he continues across the grounds, unflinching.
I peer around his waist, as shadows streak across the lawn towards us.
They come to a halt in front of us, stopping Caleb in his tracks.
"There's one in girls' bathroom, in the east wing," Caleb says.
"They're using the air vents to infiltrate the school."
"We rounded up a couple more," says an unfamiliar voice.
"Don't think they've hurt anyone."
"They only want her," Caleb says.
"Make sure they're all dealt with."
There are hurried footsteps as whoever Caleb was talking to takes off again.
"Caleb, what's going on?
Put me down now or I swear I'll scream."
I start to squirm in his arms.
"I would rather you didn't," he says quietly, locking his arm securely around me.
"I've had a very bad day."
He sets me down on some kind of ledge, and I turn around to find myself standing on the wide, stone rim of the fountain.
No water flows from the jug in the arms of the statuette standing in the centre of the basin, and yet the fountain is filled with dark water that appears to be churning slightly, rippling under a beam of light cast by the tiny spotlights that decorate the edge.
It's starting to rain and tiny droplets pelt the surface.
Caleb kicks off his shoes and climbs up on to the ledge beside me; he shrugs out of the metal casing of his knight's costume and whips the grey tunic off over his head, before throwing both to the ground.
"Can you swim?"
He places a hand at the base of my back and ushers me towards the water.
"Yes, of course, but-"  He grabs my hand and takes another step towards the water.
This doesn't make any sense.
The fountain is shallow; it would barely reach our knees.
At least that's what I thought, but the sky is suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning and I see that the fountain is deep, dark, bottomless.
"No," I jump down from the ledge.
"What is happening?"
Caleb's expression darkens.
"Casey, I need you to get up on this ledge.
Now."
Panic tears through me as I look at the sinister dark water.
"No."
Before he can stop me, I turn and set off at a run, thunder sounding overhead.
I run as fast as I can, my heart thumping in my chest, my dress scooped up around my thighs as I race across the lawn.
But Caleb catches me easily.
I hear his footsteps behind me, his rapid breath, and then he tackles me to the ground.
He turns me over roughly.
"There isn't time for this."
The rain is heavier now and beads of water drip from his hair.
I draw in a huge breath to scream, but Caleb clamps a hand over my mouth.
"Casey, please be quiet."
I try to squirm out of his grip.
"Casey, look at me."
I reluctantly look into Caleb's eyes, still a vivid green despite the darkness, both earnest and dangerous at the same time.
I grab his wrist, but he's feeling too much, there is too much adrenaline coursing through his veins for me to get a clear reading on whether or not I can trust him.
His eyes flicker to my hand.
"I know what you're doing.
I know that you're trying to feel my emotions, I know that it's a power you've had since the night Lana fell from the cliffs and right now, it's shutting down because you're afraid."
He gently lifts his hand from my mouth as I stare at him resolutely.
"I'm not afraid of you."
"Good, you have no need to fear me," he puts his lips to my ear and whispers two words, two words that stop me from struggling, that keep me from screaming.
"It's time."
"What did you say?"
"I said it's time, Casey."
"Time for what?"
He pulls me into a sitting position and takes my face in his hands.
"Time for you to learn the truth."
"The truth about what?
Caleb, what is this all about?"
He shakes his head.
"Not here, I need you to come with me."
"Where?
Into the fountain?"
I say, pulling a face.
"Yes."
"That doesn't make any sense."
Caleb says nothing as he starts back in the direction of the drive.
"Tell me what's going on," I say.
"What you just said, 'it's time', I read those words in a message today.
Did you know about that?"
He nods.
"Ivy left a note for you."
I narrow my eyes at him.
"Did Bria tell you?"
"No."
"Then how-" Lightning flashes overhead again, followed by a rumble of thunder.
"Casey, we're wasting time.
If you want answers, you have to come with me and you have to do what I say, regardless of whether or not it makes sense to you."
I look back at the patio.
I am closer now, I could scream and I'm certain that someone would hear me, but then I look into those green eyes, wide with sincerity, and I find myself nodding.
"OK."
Caleb helps me to my feet and guides me back to the fountain.
The rain is heavier now and my hair is stuck to my neck, my dress weighed down.
As I climb up on to the ledge, the water starts to thrash violently, pitching and turning like a rough sea.
"I don't understand what the fountain has to do with all of this."
He links his fingers with mine.
"It's a portal."
"What?"
He smirks a little, but it doesn't reach his eyes.
"A portal, it'll take us where we need to go."
I want to laugh, because as terrifying and confusing as this night has become, this is the most ludicrous thing I've heard so far.
"OK, let's say I believe you," my hand is clammy wrapped in his long fingers.
"Where will it take us?"
Caleb tightens his grip.
"Remember what I said, if you want answers, you have to do what I say."
I look at the chasm before us, utterly bewildered.
"OK."
