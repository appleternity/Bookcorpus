With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively.

This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Building_subparts', 'tfidf': 0.5949220873648109, 'lexical_unit': 'cellar.n / checkroom.n / altar.n', 'definition': "This frame includes words that name subparts of buildings that can be occupied by people.

Medical interactions normally take place at a Medical_center (a hospital or doctor's office), but in cases where the Patient suffers a sudden catastrophic Affliction, the Patient may be taken into the care of EMTs, who act as their Medic until reaching a medical center. '' In some cases, the Body_system that has a problem is mentioned in place of the Affliction.  'Her three cardiac patients take up all her time.' 'Our doctors provide the best healthcare on the planet.'"}, {'frame': 'Contacting', 'tfidf': 1.48191499710083, 'lexical_unit': 'page.v / call in.v / telephone.v', 'definition': "A Communicator (whose Location may be indicated) directs a Communication to an Addressee at a particular Address.  Note that no actual successful communicative act is implied, only the successful completion of acts which would establish the communication.  (In other words, Mari can e-mail Jon without Jon ever reading it.) NB:  The Address or Location_of_communicator may be a virtual address, such as an e-mail or telephone number.'Disgruntled voters phoned Congressman Neil at his Washington residence with complaints about the recent increases in corporate welfare.''She tried to call from the payphone down the street.'

Though it need not, in many cases, the created Artifact is intended to represent an actual or imagined entity or event, the Represented. The Represented may be specifically shown in a particular state (State_of_represented).    'Sir Denis Mahon is the owner of the most important private collection of Italian Baroque paintings.'

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability. (MET)' 'It says a lot that he did n't come back.

Some words normally allow the Vehicle to be expressed as a separate constituent. 'Tim drove his car all the way across North America.' 'Tom paddled my canoe across the Canadian border.'  Other words in this domain are based on the names of vehicles, and do not normally allow the Vehicle to be expressed as a separate constituent. 'The group biked all the way across the country.'

A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement.

This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Isabelle scrunches up her nose.
"What's that?"
"Shepherd's pie sounds like a dessert, but it's not.
Ground beef is slopped together with peas, corn, and gravy, buried under a mashed potato blanket.
Nothing like a pie."
Isabelle's house is squeaky clean and a bit haunted house-ish.
The chandeliers glow dim.
The gold brocade draperies are closed.
Soft velvet cushions cover her couch and ornate statues guard the corners.
Perfect for a ghost story.
Her tidy home with deep cherry wood furniture smells of lemon.
Usually her mom stays home and cooks or rests on the couch watching soap operas unless she's out shopping.
Her dad works late, and Joey is at football practice.
Isabelle and I rattle her house when we walk through the doors.
We head straight to the TV in the den.
Isabelle introduced me to Asteroids, now my favorite video game, and I'm hooked.
I love sending my mind into outer space to destroy incoming meteors as if I could save the world.
Sometimes, like today, Isabelle tries to bribe me to stop playing.
"I'll make you a vanilla milkshake if you shut off the game."
I give in for ice cream.
While slurping the last of the shake, Isabelle surprises me with a question.
"What will you do when Randi gets out of the hospital?
Will you hang out with her or me?"
The truth pops out of my mouth before I can stop it.
"I'll have to see her sometimes."
Isabelle frowns, so I back pedal.
"Maybe I can see her every other day--go back and forth playing with both of you.
Unless you want to come with me to her house."
"I don't like Randi.
I mean, not that I don't like her.
It's just she's strange, and I wouldn't want to hang out with her.
You have to make a choice between us."
Isabelle turns her back to me.
Is she crying?
What I want to say is: You don't even know her.
She's not weird.
She's nicer than you!
But the words stay locked in my mind.
I still have a couple of weeks before I have to deal with the problem of choosing friends.
How will I tell Isabelle that I want to see Randi because she is still my best friend?
I don't want Isabelle to hate me either.
Being in the middle is the worst.
On Mondays, Isabelle stays after school for band practice, so I choose a bus seat in the first row, next to Kimmy, a girl in Randi's class.
Before the bus even starts to move, Kimmy starts talking, barely takes a breath, and I regret my seat choice.
Kimmy is like a fly buzzing in my ear.
I have a strong urge to swat her.
"Have you seen Randi in the hospital yet?
Our class decorated a giant card for her.
Do you know how she's doing?"
"I went to visit her a month ago."
For the first time, Kimmy is quiet.
"She looked terrible.
She had no hair and looked so skinny since she's been losing weight.
And can you believe she only weighs forty pounds now?"
I add, hoping to shock her with my news.
"That's not so skinny," Kimmy retorts.
"I weigh forty pounds too."
Her comment irritates me, and I'm glad she gets off at the next stop.
Why did I answer Kimmy and gossip about Randi like I was handing out the latest newspaper for anyone to read?
What if Michael had heard us?
I would've felt horrible.
Good thing his mom picked him up today.
I kick the door open and drop my backpack on the floor.
"You okay?
Come help me bake a cake," Mom calls from the kitchen.
"And you can lick the beaters."
"What's the cake for?"
"Oh, I just felt like cooking something sweet for my sweetie."
I try not to cringe.
"How was school today?"
"Okay, I guess.
I got a 93 on my math test."
That's all I tell her.
"That's wonderful, honey.
I'm so proud of you."
She wouldn't be so proud if she knew how I gossiped about Randi today.
I wonder if Randi has a hidden side.
The only flaw I can see in Randi is the one she can't help.
As we sit down for dinner, Mom can't contain her secret any longer.
"Guess what I heard this afternoon?"
She doesn't wait for us to guess.
"Randi's coming home tomorrow, just in time for her birthday.
You girls are invited to her party on Saturday.
Mrs.
Picconi said it will be a casual party, just family and her closest friends over for deli sandwiches and cake.
That gives us two days to find a special gift."
"Wow, that's great!"
I should be excited.
And I am...I think.
But now I have to decide: But now I have to decide: how can I be loyal to my old friend and keep my new friend?
Someone's going to be mad at me--I'm sure.
Randi has been in the hospital for almost two months, and I'm used to life without her.
That sounds cruel, but it happened.
Tomorrow, she comes home.
How do I rewind my life and go back to the way it was?
Chapter 9
I don't like April weather.
It's too confusing.
Cloudy, sunny, breezy, rainy, warm in the sunshine, cool in the shade, hot wearing long sleeves, cold wearing short sleeves.
The breeze gives me goose bumps when I take off my sweater.
When I put it back on, I sweat.
Just as the weather can't seem to make up its mind, I'm having trouble deciding what to wear today.
If I wear a dress to Randi's party, I might be chilly or overdressed.
But my pants are all ugly, old, or ripped.
What about color and comfort?
White might get stained.
Some shirts have scratchy tags.
Whatever I choose--I'm not ready for today.
"What time is it?"
I wait for Dad to lift his face from the Agatha Christie mystery novel.
"Well, let's see.
It's five minutes later than the time I just told you.
It's 1:30."
He rests his book on the corner of the oak coffee table that Laurie decorated with permanent red marker lines at age two.
"Why don't you sign the card and we'll go over to the party in about twenty minutes.
It will come sooner if you stop watching the clock or stop making me watch the clock."
Dad returns to his book and I return to clock watching and tracing the red lines with my finger.
I haven't been in Randi's house for two months--since the day before her operation.
Now things are different, more than just her looks.
I doubt she knows I've been playing with Isabelle almost every day while she was in the hospital, unless her mother noticed and told her.
This is the first time I'm keeping a secret from Randi.
I'm not about to mention Isabelle today, her first week back.
I'll just keep my mouth shut.
Michael greets us at the door, blowing a party horn, and wearing a pointy, red party hat.
Pink and purple streamers drape across corners.
Matching balloons dance around every room.
In addition to the Happy Birthday sign is a Welcome Home sign hanging at the entrance to the kitchen.
Billy Joel songs fill Randi's house with a familiar sound.
Is everything going to be back to normal soon?
Can we play together like we used to?
Am I still her best friend?
Is she still my best friend?
I look around for Randi, clutching her present to my chest.
Mrs.
Picconi takes Mom's hand.
"I'm so glad you came.
It means a lot to Randi."
I hope Mom doesn't say something to make Mrs. Picconi cry.
Remember, Mom, it's supposed to be a party.
"We're just thrilled that Randi's home.
Francie has been counting the days."
Yes, I guess I have.
But not for the reason Mom thinks.
"Come in. Help yourselves to sandwiches in the kitchen.
You remember my parents and my brother Joe and his wife, Barbara."
As I'm peering into the other room, Mrs. Picconi puts her arm around my shoulders.
"Randi will be down soon.
She's feeling nauseous today."
Then she calls Michael over.
"I'd like you to hand out the hats and horns to all the kids and have them wait at the bottom of the stairs.
