In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The balcony itself was a lapse in security, but no one knew they were here, and Cruz would go back to the city to fight his battles.
Pamela could stay out here at the hotel and be no part of that.
The hotel had a fine dining room, but Cruz imagined they would order from room service instead.
Maybe he would order a drink with dinner.
A bottle of wine, perhaps?
Sure.
The thought came again: after all, this was his last night on earth.
Amazing to think that.
For a long time, Cruz had gone in to these situations with total confidence, total belief that he would come out alive and on top.
But tonight?
He didn't know.
Moss was so big, so strong, so young, and took real delight in killing.
Cruz had seen that when he shot the fat guy in the parking lot.
Moss had been almost absurdly pleased.
It could be that Moss was better suited for this, that Moss was the better man.
Cruz was getting old.
They could run.
They could have dinner, make love again, sleep for a few hours, then before first light get in her little car and run.
But where would they go?
Cruz had less than a thousand dollars in cash on him.
He had money, sure, a few hundred thousand.
But most of that money was spread out in safe deposit boxes - a few in New York, one in San Francisco, one in L.A., one in Detroit, one in Miami.
Did they know where he kept his money?
He thought maybe they did.
If he drove from here up to Canada, then crossed the continent, and slipped back in the country on the west coast, how could he be sure they wouldn't have someone waiting for him when he pulled up to his bank in San Francisco?
He couldn't be sure.
He had credit cards, he had a checking account.
But they left a paper trail.
Anybody could find him like that.
Pamela probably had a little money, but they knew her name by now.
No, it was no good.
Even if he was able to get his all money out of the bank, even if he could do that and disappear, the day would come when it ran out.
Worse, the day would come when he came into his home and found Roland Moss waiting for him with a couple other guys - and there were guys in this business who were worse than Roland Moss.
Cruz knew.
He used to be one of them. No.
He would go tonight to find Smoke Dugan.
And he would try to convince Dugan to split the $2.5 mil he had taken.
Moss would find them - of course he would.
And Cruz and Moss would finish their business with each other.
He tried to imagine it the way he wanted it to go.
No hesitation.
No remorse.
As soon as you see him, kill him.
He couldn't really picture it somehow.
Earlier, the fat man had been shooting at them, and still Cruz couldn't take him out.
He was done killing, it seemed.
It didn't bode well for the meeting with Moss.
It didn't bode well for any future meetings.
The last red rays of the sun were disappearing behind the trees.
"What do you say, Pamela?
Do you want to head back to the room?
Maybe order up some dinner?"
She smiled, but he could see the pain in it.
"Sure."
* * *   "They said you stole a lot of money.
Did you?"
"I took it as a payment."
"Do you still have it?"
"In a manner of speaking, yes."
Smoke sat in the chair facing her.
He had spent most of the afternoon telling her his story, the relevant parts, filling in gaps in his history that he had paved right over in the year they had been together.
The sun had gone down outside their window on the re-telling of his story.
She had taken it in stride.
She didn't blame him for the deaths on that airplane - on the contrary, she sympathized with him.
He had been used, she said.
She even sympathized that he had killed Roselli.
He had never murdered anyone like he had done to Roselli.
If the airplane had never happened, then Smoke Dugan would have never murdered anyone.
Very surprising to Smoke, however, was her story of recent days.
He knew she was a fit girl.
He knew she had taken all this karate and had these black belts, but he had never put much credence in that sort of thing.
It was a straight-world hobby, and to Smoke, a hobby was? well, a hobby.
Kind of like roller-skating.
"So these men were? pornographers?"
"Yeah, and what they did was trick girls into being in these pictures."
"Jesus, Lola."
"So I made a mistake.
It seems like a pretty common mistake."
"And you could have been hurt."
She smiled.
"And that's exactly my point.
I wasn't hurt.
Not at all.
I kicked their tails.
And when the time came, I kicked your big man Moss's ass, too."
Smoke had some trouble swallowing that one.
"I'm like, I'm like a ninja, Smoke."
Smoke raised an eyebrow.
"That's what I'm realizing about myself.
Even when they had me tied down in the bed, before Hal rescued me and his friend was killed, I felt calm.
I felt like I could handle anything that happened.
Which is why I say it should be me who goes up to the apartment tonight."
It was a bone of contention between them.
Smoke was of a mind that Pamela was likely dead by now.
Lola was of a mind that she was still alive.
Smoke was willing to go along with that premise, and the premise that they should rescue her.
But going to the police was out of the question - Smoke couldn't afford to be arrested because he wouldn't last long once his old friends knew he was in custody.
And anyway, the presence of cops would mean that if they hadn't killed Pamela yet, they sure would now.
So it was up to them to save Pamela.
And Lola though that meant it was up to her.
"Look Smoke, it's got to be me.
I'm younger than you are.
I'm faster than you are.
I'm stronger than you are.
I kick high and hard.
And I'm darker.
At night, I'm going to blend in better.
And they don't want me, anyway.
They proved that already.
When they had me, they just looked for a way to trade me in for you."
"I should go with you," he said.
She shook her head and the curls bounced.
"No.
You'll only slow me down.
I'll be up those stairs, in the apartment, and back out again in five minutes or less."
He hated it.
It terrified him.
It made him feel weak.
But she was right.
In every way, she was better suited for this sort of thing than he.
"And then what?
What if there's no sign of her?"
Lola shook her head again.
"I don't know."
They stared at each other for a long minute.
"I guess we wait another day," she said, "then go back again tomorrow night.
If there's still nothing, I guess we take your money and run."

They lay together on tangled sheets.
Cruz opened his eyes and only then became aware that he had slept.
He glanced at Pamela, her eyes closed, her stomach rising softly.
She wore only a white tank undershirt of his, which she must have pulled on while he was asleep.
The sliding glass door was still open, and Cruz could hear the waves pounding.
He wanted to hear that sound forever.
The breeze coming through the screen had turned cold, and he pulled up the blanket to cover them both.
Across the way, on the table lay the ruins of the meal they had ordered from room service, including the bottle of red wine they had finished.
His head was floating from the food, the wine and from Pamela's heat.
This time had been different, wilder, more about physical needs.
He thought about that and it made him hunger for her again.
The digital clock on the desk said 8:13.
Cruz sighed and reached across for his jacket, which hung on the chair.
He searched the inside pocket, and found what he was looking for: a pair of stainless steel, chain-link handcuffs.
These were the very same cuffs Pamela had worn last night and earlier today.
He opened one of the cuffs, gently took Pamela's wrist, and cuffed her to the bed post.
He made it tight enough that she couldn't slip out.
She would find it uncomfortable, but probably not painful.
He stood, closed the glass door to the balcony, and pulled the curtain shut.
The breeze on his naked skin had given him gooseflesh.
Then he turned on the lamp on the desk.
He turned it to its lowest setting.
