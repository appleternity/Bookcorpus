This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Future.n, and most uses of alternative.n and possibility.n all evoke nothing more than a simple possible situation (not necessarily an Situation) with no Agent; the remaining frames would inherit from this. ''2. Use.n evokes different possible things that can be done with a Salient_entity (i.e., Purposes) and thus uses the Using frame; in this frame, the target denotes the Purpose that can be achieved. ''3. way.n evokes different events that can lead to an Outcome (not necessarily a Purpose); this frame should use the Means frame.  In this frame, the target denotes the possible Means actions. ''4. option.n, choice.n, and many instances of alternative.n and possibility.n, evoke possible Situations that an implicit or explicit Agent can bring about at will.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable. '}];

Governor McEntyre had been trying to draw the Cardinal in, making official overtures of friendship, but the actions of her and her husband spoke louder than her words.
We were pretty sure she wasn't being sincere with the Cardinal.
Pope Peter sent me up here to see if I could find out what they were up to.
I didn't think I was going to see her die in front of me!"
...and I didn't...
"So you're a spy?
For the Pope?
But not a killer, huh?
That's still a lot, man."
"Well.
Now you know all my secrets."
"I sincerely doubt that," Edwards says and begins to laugh, "but I've heard enough.
It really comes down to you versus Daniel.
You, I've only known for a short time.
I've known him for a couple of years, but I really don't 'know' him that well.
I knew Meredith better.
I liked her.
She was a good woman.
It's hard to believe she worked for the UIN, like you say.
I think I trust you more than I trust him, but neither of you has me entirely convinced."
"Look, Marc, the OPO knew both the McEntyres were working with the UIN.
But what if Meredith had stopped?
What if we were wrong, and her overtures toward the Cardinal were for real?
It might explain why they killed her.
Daniel's probably still working with them!
How did he get that fake dossier, huh?"
"That's a good question."
"He's got to be UIN, Marc.
While I'm gone, you should be careful.
Keep him under close watch.
He's poison.
I don't know if you still want my advice, but I hope you'll take it this time."
"I still like you, BC, and still trust you on some level.
I'd still like your advice.
But trust is a rare commodity, I don't spread it around easily."
"I don't blame you.
Neither do I.
I usually don't trust anyone.
But I like you, Marc, you're my kind of people, and I can trust you on some level, too, I think.
So if you want my advice, you've got it.
I've got to get going... if we're okay.
I've told you all I can about what I'm doing here on the Moon."
"Not exactly a simple priest...
" "Will you keep my secrets?"
"Sure.
It's a deal."
Edwards stands and extends his hand.
BC leans across the desk and shakes it.
A strong, solid handshake.
Good sign.
"Open the office!"
Edwards calls to the room's security unit.
The room whirs and clicks again, and the office door pops open.
"Give me a call when you get back here, BC."
"I will."
BC leaves the office, heads back through the atrium and back to his rooms.
He notices he's breathing a little heavy and his heart is racing.
That was too close.
McEntyre's dead when I get back here.
He'll be trying to undermine me the whole time I'm gone, I'm sure.
I hope I've convinced Edwards not to listen to him.
He is poison!
Chapter Thirteen
BC goes back to packing for the trip and the job ahead.
He reviews the space station plans and maps out strategies in his head as he checks the charge on his hand laser.
He throws in a wrist-worn dart thrower and a small box of poison darts for good measure.
BC hides the CCU away in his rebuilt room, behind a wall panel that used to be a small closet door.
The closet remains, but BC has disguised the door to look like another innocent wall panel.
This hit is a little more primitive than the hit on McEntyre.
No killbots, nothing that sophisticated.
Might be just brute force, blunt trauma... have to play it by ear as I go.
Ah, violence is so not my style.
Still, this is the least political job I've ever had to do.
If this guy is killing people in the name of God, then he already plays by my rules.
And under those rules, I am God's instrument of vengeance for those he's killed.
I am the right hand of God, come to put the Light Bearer back in his place.
His nemesis come to punish his hubris... but now I'm mixing my mythologies.
BC packs an airhypo, air cartridges and tranks and toxins, and tucks the blueprints and plans away as well.
That should do it.
Now it's off to see the Wizard...
He throws in some clothes, zips up his cases, powers down his rooms, locks his door and heads for the Reagan Station Spaceport to meet Captain Adrian Longeux and board the Paladin IV.
"Father Campion!
Over here!"
BC recognizes Longeux from the security photo.
He's kind of a squat man, heavy set, with gray hair and the round face from the picture.
He's dressed entirely in green, a one-piece jumpsuit with "Paladin IV" stitched in gold above the breast pocket.
He's also got a big gold crucifix hanging down around his neck.
A man of God, to be sure.
BC meets him at the private gate the port directory said the Paladin IV would be docked at.
As BC approaches, Longeux reaches out for and eagerly shakes BC's hand.
"It's an honor to meet you, Father!
It's not every day I get orders from the Vatican!
I've been practically bursting at the seams, not being able to tell anyone and all.
Imagine that, best commission of my life, and I can't tell anybody!
And you," Longeux laughs, "you already know, so I'm not telling you anything!"
He laughs again, "You ready to go?"
"Yes, yes I am, Mr. Longeux.
It's nice to meet you as well."
I like his laugh.
A little over friendly, but what the heck.
Could be worse.
"They couldn't tell me anything about this trip, said you'd fill me in on the details."
"Yes.
I'll do that once we set out.
Can we board now?"
"Sure!"
Longeux turns and cycles the hatch behind him open.
"Right this way, Father."
Longeux reaches for BC's cases, but BC stops him.
"Thanks, Mr. Longeux, but I'm fine to carry these myself.
You've got a whole ship to handle, don't worry about my luggage."
"Well, we're pretty much all set, really.
I've got clearance for us to take off in about an hour.
The Paladin's fueled and prepped for the flight.
All we gotta do is get on board and go!"
Longeux motions BC ahead of him through the hatch, then steps through himself and closes the hatch behind him.
They're in a small airlock, another hatch just ahead.
Longeux reaches around BC and punches a code into the door panel in front of him.
The hatch opens on a passageway extending down to the ship.
BC steps through into the passageway.
It's square and accordion shaped on the sides to expand and contract in the distance between the outer wall of Lunar Prime and the hull of the ship, with a central walkway and handholds running down either side.
Like being inside an accordion, complete with a handy walkway.
Longeux steps through behind BC, closes the hatch and punches another code into the door panel on this side.
He motions to BC to continue down to the ship.
BC feels the gravity let go as they walk down the passageway.
His stomach protests, but he manages to keep his breakfast down.
He fumbles a little in the low G, but Longeux reaches out and steadies him.
"It can be hard to adjust to the changing gravities, Father.
I think you'll find it better once we're on the ship.
She's a good ship, Father.
The Paladin's been fueled, and I just had the air recycling system recharged, so it should be good and fresh.
I don't have any cargo, nothing but yourself, like the Vatican asked.
They paid me well.
I'm not complaining, Father, don't get me wrong.
Here we are, the Paladin IV!"
Longeux squeezes past BC to open the hatch to his ship, then steps aside to let BC enter.
"Go ahead into the airlock, Father.
Welcome aboard!"
BC passes through the airlock and into the Paladin IV.
He enters a corridor open to both sides.
The Paladin IV's colors appear to be green and gold.
A green carpet lines the floor.
Green and gold stripes run along about waist high on the gray wall in front of BC.
And BC also notices there's definitely more gravity than there was just outside the ship.
BC takes it all in as Longeux enters behind him, still talking.
"You know, Father, I go to mass a lot on the Moon and I don't remember ever seeing you there."
"I work more behind the scenes, Mr. Longeux."
"Well, I hope you don't mind me asking... if we're gonna be traveling past Sunday, I was hoping you might say a Mass for us, at least on Sunday.
I know you're more casual than, say, the Cardinal.
I like his masses.
