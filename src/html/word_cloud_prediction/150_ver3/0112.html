This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

Off we went, purty as you please, that mule comin' along like a family dog.
It took over a hour to git to town.
By the time we got down the main street, around the corner a block or two from the Houston House, an' down to the doctor's office, we had quite a herd a folks taggin' along.
Two bluevests were in the pack.
One of 'em was Clarence Banks.
"What's goin' on here, Mister Beeler?"
he said.
"Them two fellers on the mule an' the horse shot this feller in the wagon an' was fixin' to use his daughter, Martha," I said.
"I stopped 'em.
They was both alive when I tied 'em on.
I don't know what shape they're in now."
A voice from the crowd spoke up.
"They're dead," it said.
"You shoot these men, Mister Beeler?"
Clarence asked.
"Yes, I did, Clarence, an' I wish you'd call me Ruben," I said.
"After all we been through together, you oughta use my first name."
I stood up in the buckboard an' looked at the crowd.
"A couple a you fellers ketch aholt a this man in the wagon an' git him toted into the doctor's office.
Be nice if one a you ladies was to help his daughter out.
She's been knocked around some an' could use a woman's touch an' comfort."
The crowd kindly surged forward then an' got to it.
I jumped down an' walked out into the street to where Willie was standin' an' collected him.
Clarence followed along.
"Mister Beeler...uh, Ruben," he said, "the Sheriff is gonna want to see you about this."
"Clarence," I said, "you tell Arberry if he wants to talk about anything, I'll either be at the gunsmith's place or in the Sweetwater.
I've had a hard day.
If'n Arberry wants to talk he can, by God, come to me.
You can also tell the Doc that I'll stand good for this fella's bill, an' the lady at the dress shop that I'll pay for the girl to git a couple a new dresses.
As for the undertaker, he's on his own with these two pieces a shit."
I clumb up on Willie then, an' rode down to Arliss' place.
He was standin' out front watchin' me come.
"Welcome back," he said.
"What's all the fuss about?"
"Not much," I said.
"I just saved a fella from dyin', his daughter from bein' raped an' kilt, an' shot two fellas to death this afternoon.
You buy supper an' I'll tell you the whole heroic story."
"You wanna go back to the Crystal?"
he asked.
"Aw, hell," I said.
"You go clean up a little," Arliss said.
"I'll take your horse down to the livery for ya an' meet you at the Sweetwater."
I thanked him an' walked to Miz Clary's.
Didn't take me long to wash my face an' change shirts.
I left the shotgun behind but kept the Schofield an' walked on down to the Sweetwater.
There was several folks inside when I got there, an' a few nodded at me when I come in.
I nodded back an' took a seat back from the window a ways.
I hadden more than set, when here come Margie, big ol' grin on her face, near skippin' in my direction.
"Ruben!"
she said, like she hadn't seen me in a year, "folks in here sayin' yer a hero!"
"Me an' Bill Cody is about the best there is, I guess," I said.
"Don't be like that," she said.
"They claim you saved a family from a bunch a outlaws!"
"I cain't help what folks say," I said.
"Wasn't much to it, at least not near as much as there will be a couple a days from now, the way people talk."
Arliss showed up then, an' set.
Margie smiled at him.
"Arliss," she said, "I guess you know yer settin' with a hero."
"Shore I do," Arliss said.
"He's a rare one, no doubt about that.
A privilege just to be in the same room with the boy.
I wanna be just like him when I grow up."
Margie appeared to be some confused.
"We got some good roast beef tonight," she said, lookin' for familiar ground.
"It comes with taters an' carrots."
"That'll do for both of us," Arliss said.
"Me an' the hero here thank ya."
She skittered away an' I looked at Arliss.
"You havin' fun?"
I asked.
"I'm havin' a great time," he said.
"How 'bout you?"
I couldn't help it.
I laughed.
"Goddammit, Arliss," I said.
"You ain't fixin' to draw down on me are ya?"
he said.
I purty much fell in the well then.
It took a minute for me to settle down.
About the time I got a grip, High Sheriff Arberry Yont showed up an' strutted over to the table.
"Ruben!"
he said, "are you doin' all right?"
"Arberry!"
I said, "I am.
Thanks for askin'."
"I hear you had a helluva day, son."
"Yessir," I said.
"I did.
And I'm plumb tired to be honest with ya."
"Are you fit enough to tell me what happened?"
he asked.
I give him a short version.
When I finished, he kindly puffed up.
"That goes along with what that poor little girl told me," he said.
"I don't think it'll be necessary to have a formal hearing on charges against you or anything like that."
When he said what he said, my ruff come up an' I got some mouthy.
"Ya damn right there won't," I said.
"Everthing that happened was in the county.
You ain't got no authority out there.
You're the city law, Sheriff, an' that's where it ends."
Arberry flinched a little when I come at him like that.
"Now hold on," he said.
"Yer settin' in my town.
My town, my rules.
You need to remember that, son."
"You'll have to excuse me, Sheriff," I said.
"I've had a hard day.
But you need to understand somethin'.
I know who my daddy was, an' you ain't him.
An' unless you can show me a deed, this town don't belong to you no more than it does to anybody else."
"I will excuse you this time, Mister Beeler," he said, "but this time only.
And you need to understand that."
"Thank you, Sheriff," I said.
"I always appreciate a good threat.
I'm in Deer Run an' I will play by the rules an' not give you no trouble, 'cause that's what I want to do.
But as long as both of us is bein' so understandin', understand that the Duncan gang over by Gasconade didn't scare me much when we took them down.
Damn near nothin' else does neither, sir."
That stopped Yont for a minute, then he opened his mouth agin.
"You got sand, Ruben, I shore do give you that.
I'm always lookin' for good men with sand.
Would you ever consider being a city deputy?"
"That's a right kind offer," I said, knowin' I should just shut up, "but I never liked wearin' a vest.
Green is more my color anyway."
"Suit yourself, son," he said, an' thumped out.
Arliss looked at me.
"I don't believe you made a new friend here tonight," he said.
"I doan speck I did neither," I said.
"Ruben, what the hell is the matter with you?"
"I'm hungry," I said.
"That's a relief," Arliss said.
"For a minute there, I thought you might just be stupid."
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
It took me a while to settle down that night, but when I did, I slept hard.
I plumb missed daybreak the next mornin'.
When I come down from my room, Miz Clary was in the kitchen.
She got my attention when I walked by.
"Mister Beeler," she said to me, "you c'mon in here now and set yerself."
I hadn't mentioned I was gonna want no breakfast or nothin'.
It was a house rule you had to give her advance notice on meals.
I set down at that little table she kept in the kitchen, an' she put a cup a coffee in front a me along with a little pitcher a pale yella cream an' a sugar bowl.
"Thank ya, M'am," I said.
"This here's right nice."
"Yer a little late for breakfast, Mister Beeler," she said, "but I saved back a couple a biscuits that'll still be good.
There's some bacon fried that I can heat in the skillet for ya.
How do ya like your eggs?"
"Well, M'am, I didn't give you no notice on breakfast or nothin'," I said.
"That don't make no difference this mornin'," she said.
"Fried sunny side up all right with you?"
"Yes, M'am.
That there would be just right," I said.
