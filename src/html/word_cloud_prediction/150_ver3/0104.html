This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

- Thank you, - Gina smiled again.
- No, thanks to you.
I wish you luck.
Sorry for distracting.
- No problem...
- Bill.
Bill Landis, - he raised his right hand.
- All right, Bill, - Gina nodded.
- Bye.
Once again, good luck.
- Goodbye, - I said.
We continued our steps and went to the next intersection.
- So, where was I? - she looked around.
- Here, I came to Novosibirsk and looked at all with my own eyes.
However, after the war.
- They didn't let foreigners to us, at all, until last month, - I was looking at the asphalt.
- No way!
That was just a terrible thing yet!
I wanted to come last autumn, not alone, of course, in the delegation of human rights organizations, but we weren't allowed anywhere at all.
And those people who were responsible for that, they called themselves <<diplomats>>, but they couldn't even speak with us properly.
They spoke with us in their poor English and told us so... - then she cussed out, suddenly and unexpectedly but quite clear to me, in that meaning like, would you go, Mister-Twisters, somewhere very far away.
- Come on, stop it, it can't be!
Although...
- That's it, although, - she uttered quietly, but with a kind of cold fury, - these people, in my opinion, thought too goddamn much of themselves.
They didn't, I guess, understand what they were doing at all.
Do you remember, recently I told you about the fact, that it's impossible to love all the mankind, and that it's connected with Russia, with the Novosibirsk city?
I didn't mean, of course, that you're distracted by strangers in the street.
I talked about what happened in your country.
- Not for the first time, by the way, - I said.
- That's absolutely right.
These people can't be loved.
They can't, in my opinion, even be tolerated, even for a brief period, - Gina shook her head.
- It's a nightmare, Andrey.
Fair to say that we've got such people too, but the fact what had happened to you...
Your country, such people you've got, they're just wonderful...
Okay, we're almost there, we'll talk about it for sure but later - I want to ask you a lot of things, but now let's change the topic, okay?
Because...
I want to smoke, don't you mind?
- No, please, - actually, I wanted to say, <<As we say - smoke and bless you>>, but I couldn't remember this expression in English.
- Here you're absolutely right also, - she pulled the cigarette with the lighter out of her purse, - I must leave this stupid habit off.
- Well, you give a bad example for your young fans, - I uttered.
Gina burst into her loud laughter.
- Andryukha, I'm fond of you!
- I have translated as <<Andryukha>> said by her English diminutive of my name.
- Thank you, - I laughed in response.
- I'm fond of you too.
Do you smoke for a long time at all?
- For ten years, - she breathed.
- By the way, - I remembered, - can you smoke on the street here?
- You can...
I think so, - she uttered unsurely.
- Drinking is banned exactly, I remember that.
- I see.
So what were you going to say?
You promised me a tour of the city, - at the moment we approached some vaguely familiar building-skyscraper.
- A tour of the city? - she asked.
- Please, - then she started to show in different directions with her hands: - <<The Empire State Building>> - is there, the Statue of Liberty - is here, Wall Street - is there, and Broadway - is o-over there.
I giggled, she grinned in response too.
- But I do want to say about the place to where we're going.
We have almost come - now we should go over there...
Well, we didn't make it, - the traffic light turned red.
- Now you'll see a memorial they made there.
- Memorial?
- I asked.
- Yes.
In that place where the Twin Towers were, - she glanced at my face by her enormous eyes.
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes, quite beautiful.
Although I did like the monument in Moscow more.
I mean the one on that street, I still can't exactly memorize its name - Gur'-ev?..
- Gur'yanov, - I proposed.
- Gur'yanov Street, - repeated Gina, - let's go.
We walked along the <<zebra>>.
I stepped aside, letting the passers.
- Look, where were you that day?
- At the Toronto Film Festival, - she turned away and spat into the box standing on the corner.
- I was presenting my new film.
I said nothing, because a silly phrase was spinning in my mind - something like <<What did you feel then?>>.
- We were all there watching television and didn't believe what was happening.
At last, we have come.
Please, the World Trade Center was at this point.
Gina and I were in a small park, around the perimeter of which there were the metal benches, the lawn was located behind them, and a small vertical pedestal was in the middle of it.
- Let's come?
- I proposed.
- Of course, - she said.
We walked towards the monument at a leisurely pace.
- This is a temporary memorial, - uttered Gina, - they wish to make something else here.
- Restore the buildings?
- I didn't understand.
- No, - she stopped and turned to me.
- That is, they restore them, you're right, but not there.
It seems to be, they wanted to build a new set of Double-Yu-Ti-Si, not far from here.
- And here?
- Some new memorial is designing, - though perhaps I should translate that word in a different way, not even translate, but leave it as well - <<A memorial>>.
- I see, - I said.
- Let's go and sit over there, - she shook her head in the direction of the benches.
- Okay.
Most of them were empty, but I paid attention that there were people of various sex and age on some of them,.
Yes, three thousand people died.
That's never mind by our standards, but here that was certainly something hard.
Although I don't know, I shouldn't probably call that never mind...
Damn, I think something wrong.
- Andrey, are you okay?
- Gina interrupted my thought process.
- Yes, everything is good, - I blinked.
We sat on a warm iron.
- I like when you do that, - she narrowed her eyes, - I'm a little worried about... that you don't much like to look me in the eyes.
- Yes, you're right, - I looked at her, - and will it be okay like that?
- Oh, come on! - she laughed.
- I want to find out one thing from you.
- Please.
- Do you remember when we went up to our room, Alexander Tugarinov told Doctor Knox that he is from intelligence and then he sang something in Russian?
- Of course, I remember, - I replied.
- Do you know this song?
- Gina again articulated all that with the same cold seriousness, like a few minutes ago.
- Yes, I know.
- This song is - from the time of Stalin, isn't it? - she specified.
- Right.
Nineteen thirty-eight year, - I said.
- I thought so.
Such songs were sung only under Stalin, - she shook her head.
- Translate me those words, please. - <<Our intelligence - is the whole people>>, - I uttered.
- And what next, do you remember?
In this song, I mean? - <<The enemy will not pass the borders...>>, - I started quoting inaccurately. - <<But if he passes, he will be in the Yezhov's...>>.
Damn!..
I don't know how to...
- In Yezhov's tight rein?
- Gina asked.
- Exactly.
How do you know that? - she didn't cease to amaze me, to put it mildly.
- You'll understand it soon.
Yezhov, - Gina accentuated the last syllable correctly, - right?
Nicholas?
- Yes, - I looked at her, - Nikolay Ivanovich Yezhov.
- Nikola-y Ivanovich, - she pronounced in Russian, - he was the head of the...
En-Key-Vi-Di in Stalin's time, am I right?
- Yes, - I confirmed.
- As I recall, that means <<People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs>>, right?
- Gina licked her lips, and then added: - It's like ministries today?
Here.
How it will be in Russian, please, tell me.
- Narodnyi Komissariat Vnutrennih Del, - I pronounced in the native language. - <<Na-rodnyi>>, - Gina repeated with the accent on the second syllable, - <<Komissariat...>>. <<Vnutrenniy...>>. - <<Vnutrennih>>, - I corrected.
- Well, <<vnutrennih>>, I see, <<del>>.
Del? - <<vnutrennih>> and <<del>> were also said by her in my words.
- Del.
- So, about those particular internal affairs.
Did you read Doctor Robert Conquest's book <<The Great Terror>>?
- Yes, - I was a little surprised again.
- I reread this book four times, - said Gina, - but I still can't understand how this could be.
I asked Doctor Conquest...
