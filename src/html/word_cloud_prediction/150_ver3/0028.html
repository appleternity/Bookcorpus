This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI.

'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

"Mother does know Sydney very well and has some ideas about where we should be shooting for the American campaign."
Ellen thought back to a recent conversation with one of the photographers.
"Wasn't that all decided a couple of months ago?"
"Apparently, yes," Tom confirmed with a murmur.
Ellen was confused.
"So, why isn't she here then?"
"The old man isn't feeling well, so she stayed home to look after him."
"Oh, I'm sorry.
It's nothing serious I hope."
"No, just the flu I think."
"That's good.
By the way, did you see today's paper?"
asked Ellen.
"No, why?
Do they have another photo of us?"
"Yep, page eight.
The paper called you a playboy today and said I was your newest toy.
They photographed us kissing at that Italian restaurant last week, by the look of it."
"Have you spoken to your parents yet?"
"I have.
I just told them the basics.
That I was dating a very nice man, who happens to be a little older than me.
Straight away they asked how much older of course, but I think they are fine about it."
"Did you tell them my name?"
"Of course, but they haven't heard of you, so it didn't matter."
"They haven't heard of me?"
Tom repeated, pretending to be shocked by the idea.
"Oh well, I hope your parents don't see the article from today.
I didn't even see a photographer that night, did you?"
"No."
"So, do they want to meet me yet?"
"They said if we're still seeing each other in three months, they will travel to the city to meet you.
That's a big thing you know.
My folks hate the city."
"Maybe we could take a trip to visit them instead."
"Sure, we could do that.
We're kind of preoccupied for the next few weeks though."
They arrived at Sydney's Hilton Hotel shortly after, and were met by a porter who collected their luggage from the chauffeur.
The porter informed them, "Your bags will be upstairs shortly, Mr Bradley."
Tom nodded thanks.
Inside, they were met by the concierge in the foyer.
"Tom Bradley and Ellen Jackson," Tom said to the man.
"Yes, sir.
Come with me please."
Ellen nudged Tom, "Don't we have to check in?"
she said, while looking towards reception, where there was a line of people.
"No," Tom said.
"Elizabeth will have taken care of all the minor details for us."
Ellen was continually amazed by the pace of her life with Tom.
Things just seemed to happen so easily.
Tom had booked one of the penthouse suites which had multiple bedrooms and a large balcony looking over the city.
Tom thanked the concierge, and returned to her side.
"I know you've got an early morning.
How about we order some room service and eat in?"
"Sounds good to me.
I would appreciate an early night."
Ellen was in town along with a crew from Satinol, shooting two commercials for the North American market.
The close-up video was being done on Friday and Saturday, and the location shots Monday to Wednesday.
An intensive week was planned, but Ellen was looking forward to it with excitement and enthusiasm.
Chapter Twelve Colleen walked free from the Easternvale Women's detention centre on an overcast Wednesday morning in late September.
Her personal belongings had been packed into the one small bag she had taken into prison.
On departure, the prison provided her with five hundred dollars in cash and a weekly train ticket to see her through the first week on the outside.
The past fifty-two days in jail had not been easy and yet Colleen paused at the prison gates, not quite ready to leave.
She looked back, and although it did not make any sense, felt a reluctance to move on.
It was a tough city to survive in without money and friends.
Colleen let out a deep, frustrated breath, and thought to herself.
Where am I going to sleep tonight?
The feeling of helplessness seemed to increase with every breath.
Think, Colleen, think, she told herself.
She and Ted had only lived in Melbourne for a short period of time as they had tended to move around quite a bit in the past five years.
There were no friends or family there who would take her in, that was for sure.
Colleen needed to find out for how much longer Ted would be locked up.
Her court-appointed lawyer had refused to find out.
The young girl in her smart suit and fancy high heels had said she wanted to concentrate on her case, and not Ted's.
Fat lot of good she had done anyway, thought Colleen, having lost the case, causing me to get locked up for something I didn't even do.
There was really only one choice left.
Colleen had contemplated this option numerous times before, but had never gone through with it.
There was a man from her past who lived in Melbourne.
It was a past so distant that it felt like a dream.
However, as she stood there, the realisation struck, that there really were no other places to go.
Colleen made her mind up right there and then to go.
She would try her luck today.
Once the decision was made, calmness swept over her body, and she moved away more confidently from the prison gates towards the nearby train station.
The train would take her into the city where she would find him, and he would help her.
She had no doubt.
It was time to speak to Tom Bradley again.
Chapter Thirteen Ellen's week in Sydney seemed to pass very quickly and before she knew it, the work was finished, and Tom and her were returning to Melbourne, closer than ever.
Since moving into their new apartment one month ago, Ellen and Chloe had happily started a new routine of making coffee together in the mornings.
The apartment had a built-in coffee machine, which even ground the beans by itself.
Ellen had noticed that Chloe's moods had been more positive since she had started working in Tom's office.
Chloe was dressed very well this morning, having maxed out two different credit cards to buy a range of expensive office wear.
"You look happy this morning Chloe," Ellen said, while biting into a piece of toast.
"I really love this job, Elle," Chloe said.
"Tom told me that you are doing well."
"Did he?"
asked Chloe excitedly.
"What did he say exactly?
Tell me word for word."
"Well, he said that Elizabeth was happy with the pace of your learning, and if Elizabeth is happy, then he is happy."
"Elizabeth can be a total bitch, let me tell you.
She is so bossy sometimes.
Everything has to be done exactly as she says.
But Tom is just so nice to work with.
The other day, he complimented my outfit, and said how nice I look in blue.
You know how I like to coordinate clothes and makeup with my eye colour sometimes.
Anyway, I think he noticed the colour of my eyes too, because he looked into them for quite a while."
Ellen felt slightly uncomfortable with the way Chloe was starting to talk about Tom.
"You do look good in blue, Chloe."
"And Tom is really thoughtful at work.
The other day, he gave me twenty dollars to buy him a coffee.
And he said I could buy myself one too.
Wasn't that nice?"
"Yes, very nice."
"And I thought to myself, he probably won't want the change, seeing as though he is no rich, so I kept it, just to see if he would ask for it back."
"Tell me you're joking, Chloe."
There was silence from her friend at first.
"Well, Ellen the thing is, he probably doesn't even know how much two coffees cost."
"Of course he knows how much coffee costs.
He's not stupid."
"He didn't say anything."
"He probably didn't want to embarrass you.
You should go to him and say you forgot, and give it back."
"Hmm.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I'll think about it.
I mean, he wouldn't have wanted the money back from you."
Ellen continued to sip her coffee and eat her toast, quite annoyed at Chloe, but not wanting to have a fight.
This was the first time that Ellen realised that Chloe might be feeling a little jealous of the increasing closeness between Tom and herself.
The two girls had been friends for so many years, having grown up in each other's pockets.
They knew each other's families intimately as well, and Chloe was truly entrenched in her current life in Melbourne.
There would be no easy way to end the friendship, even if Ellen decided on that course of action.
Chloe's home and job were now tied to Tom soundly.
It was best to bite her tongue and go along with Chloe's sometimes bizarre behaviour.
Ellen reasoned that everything around her had changed so dramatically over the past month.
It was unfair to expect Chloe to stay exactly the same.
"Well," Chloe said.
"I'm off to work.
Are you still staying home today, then?"
"Yes, I've got a clear day for a change.
So, I'm going running, then I've booked a facial for this morning.
Maybe a nap this afternoon," joked Ellen.
"Hmm, okay then, beauty queen.
Have a good day."
"Bye, Chloe.
See you tonight."
Chapter Fourteen Desperately hoping for a friendly reception, Colleen entered the revolving glass doors of Satinol Cosmetics.
She moved slowly, supporting a sore left arm which ached with every step.
Back at the train station, she had foolishly made a mad dash to board the train as its doors were closing.
As a result, she had been temporarily caught, her arm squashed by the heavy doors.
