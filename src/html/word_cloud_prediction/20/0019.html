Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}, {'frame': 'Increment', 'tfidf': 0.6025372309762704, 'lexical_unit': 'other.a / another.a / other.n / another.n / further.a / more.a / more.n / additional.a', 'definition': "A member or members of a Class have just been  mentioned or are present in the discourse setting and now a different instance  (or group of instances) of the same class is referred to.

But, if Brother Mike continued, then Barry would have to bring the matter before the Headmaster.
However Billy was not as mature as Barry and eventually erupted.
Brother Mike was teaching geography, white man's geography, and asked Billy where the Murray River began.
'Don't give a shit!'
Billy retorted.
'Who gives a shit where the fucking river starts?
I just know it passes through the land of my people, the Yorta-Yorta people, and we used to fish from it for food until it was stuffed up by you white mongrels.'
Silence crashed down on the class as everyone looked to see how Brother Mike would respond to Billy's outburst.
Brother Mike looked stunned; no one had ever spoken back to him like that.
Shock gave way to fury; his face went purple as his blood pressure climbed dangerously high.
'How dare you!
How dare you Yorta ...'
'My names' Billy!
Billy Yorta ...'
'...
DON'T YOU DARE INTERRUPT ME!
Just who do you think you are, talking like that, not just to your teacher, but to a man of god?'
Into the silence he continued, 'This is because that miserable show-off Thomson has allowed you too much leeway.
Because of all the favoritism he's given you, you think you can insult your teacher and get away with it.
