Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).

The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Cause_harm', 'tfidf': 0.49362888044232417, 'lexical_unit': 'bayonet.v / beat.v / boil.v / burn.v / bludgeon.v / club.v / crush.v / cut.v / slice.v / hammer.v / hit.v / kick.v / knife.v / punch.v / smash.v / stab.v / spear.v / stone.v / hurt.v / whip.v / batter.v / break.v / butt.v / chop.v / claw.v / clout.v / crack.v / cudgel.v / cuff.v / fracture.v / gash.v / injure.v / jab.v / bruise.v / knock.v / lash.v / maul.v / pelt.v / strike.v / thwack.v / bash.v / belt.v / buffet.v / horsewhip.v / smack.v / squash.v / slap.v / knee.v / wound.v / pummel.v / electrocute.v / electrocution.n / poisoning.n / beat up.v / torture.v / maim.v / flog.v / impale.v / biff.v / cane.v / flagellate.v / poison.v / transfix.v / welt.v / mutilate.v / elbow.v / sting.v / swipe.v / strike.n / drug.v / twist.v / run through.v', 'definition': "The words in this frame describe situations in which an Agent or a Cause injures a Victim.

See the following: \'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  \'Is the economy in recession ?\' \'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI \' \'\'  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer\'s mind (construed as a Ground): \'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI\' \'I felt an unease inside me .\' \'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .\' \'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .\' \'\'  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): \'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .\' \'There are so many children in the family .\' \'\'  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: \'amid the confusion\' \'inside the competition period\' \'between lunch and dinner\' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word "period") while others can take events as Grounds directly. \'\'  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): \'In the paper , `` self-control \'\' is used to mean a sense of willpower .\' \'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .\' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. \'\' \'\'  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.

Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.

In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

Azor stands, feet apart, Klage held low and forward.
Moonlight glints across the sapphire laced through his granite hide.
"You do not know what a link crew, do you?"
Derek relaxes and turns to fully face Azor.
"No.
Azor re-sheaths Klage, "Well, Golons are granite and gem from crown to toe.
Long swords, spears, arrows are all useless against us.
Generally, even war hammers and maces are a small danger to us.
On the battlefields against humans, dwarves and elves we are a tremendous threat, unstoppable if fought conventionally.
Link crews are how we are brought down.
A group of men, usually eight to a dozen, swarm around a Golon and throw hooked chains at leg, arm and neck.
I have seen my stone brothers fell in this manner.
It will never happen to me."
Raising empty hands and stepping away from the chain at his feet, Derek speaks evenly, "I didn't know, Azor.
I can understand why the sound freaked you out.
I am glad you told me though.
Now I can listen for the sound as we travel and when we are in battle.
I promise you I will not let a chain game anywhere near you."
"Thank you for that pledge, Derek.
Kinewyn swore the same words and kept his promise to this day in our travels together."
