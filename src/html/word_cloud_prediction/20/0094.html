Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

'' Those frames that inherit the Causation frame have as their background the idea that some event is responsible for the occurrence of another event (or state).  In the  inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in.  Similarly, most inheriting frames profile only the Affected entity, not the full Effect situation which is often incorporated into the frame or the particular target.  So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).  'He made me angry.'

Alternatively or in addition to Path, an Area, Direction, Source, or Goal for the movement may be mentioned.   'She walked along the road for a while.'  Many of the lexical units in this frame can also describe the motion of vehicles (e.g., as external arguments). We treat these as belonging in this frame.   'The cars scooted slowly towards the intersection.'  Self_motion most prototypically involves individuals moving under their own power by means of their bodies. Many words also specify the manner of motion (swim, walk). This frame contains mostly words that fit this prototypical scenario, but the frame itself does not specify whether a separate vehicle is impossible, necessary, or unspecified. Lexical units that involve separate vehicles are associated with FEs that are not appropriate for the more general case of motion, so they are placed in the Operate_vehicle or Ride_vehicle frames (e.g., He drove across the country, She flew to Europe)."}, {'frame': 'Direction', 'tfidf': 0.5585534996001525, 'lexical_unit': 'east.adv / up.adv / forward.adv / left.adv / right.adv / north.adv / south.n / east.n / south.adv / down.adv / outward.adv / north.n / west.adv / true north.n / way.n', 'definition': 'This frame covers the basic uses of direction words like the adverbs east, up, and forward.  These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Appellations', 'tfidf': 0.5574521929934946, 'lexical_unit': 'officer.n / general.n / captain.n / president.n / bishop.n / chairman.n / chairperson.n / chief.n / commander.n / commissioner.n / congressman.n / congresswoman.n / director.n / duchess.n / emperor.n / empress.n / executive.n / governor.n / headmaster.n / imam.n / kaiser.n / king.n / leader.n / legislator.n / maharaja.n / mayor.n / minister.n / mogul.n / monarch.n / official.n / premier.n / prince.n / principal.n / queen.n / representative.n / secretary.n / shah.n / sheik.n / sultan.n / superintendent.n / supervisor.n / tsar.n / mother.n / father.n / doctor.n / dr.n / mr.n / mrs.n / ms.n / miss.n / child.n / aunt.n / uncle.n / sister.n / brother.n / cousin.n', 'definition': "This frame is only for words that are used as the Titles of individuals.

'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Disembarking', 'tfidf': 1.3319672346115112, 'lexical_unit': 'disembark.v / debark.v / deplane.v / detrain.v / dismount.v / alight.v / debus.v / disembarkation.n / get.v', 'definition': "A Traveller leaves from or dismounts a Vehicle.

And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'

'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read the it carefully.</span>
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see two sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

The caravan was dumped in a corner of the yard, but there was no sign of Matthew with Chip.
"They want to know where they can stay, Mum.
There's nowhere around I can think of."
Mrs. Collins frowned.
"Mrs.
Myers down at the farm might help if it's only for a night or two.
She sometimes takes in visitors."
Anna tried to sound casual as she emptied one of the jugs of now-cold tea into the large sink.
The tea bags fell out with a thud.
"It's a shame, really, that we don't do bed-and-breakfast here at the cafe."
She looked up out of the corner of her eye to see her mother's reaction.
"Love you, Anna, where would we ever put people up?
The bungalow's only large enough for the two of us, and we could hardly sleep people in the cafe -- unless they slept on the tables!"
"Or under them!"
Anna added with a smile, but her heart had sunk deeper than her mother could ever know.
It had seemed such a wonderful idea at the time.
She knew that if this was her own place she'd do everything possible to help this family for the night.
She'd give up her own bed if necessary.
But she knew her mother was right.
There just wasn't enough room for anyone else to stay, and it would surely be unhygienic to have people sleeping in the cafe, and probably against some sort of law.
