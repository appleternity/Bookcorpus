Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}];

            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically

            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read the it carefully.</span>

"Wade, Jake and I have been sneaking to see each other.
I was afraid to bother Aunt Suellen, and she could not relinquish Prissy to chaperone, for she needed as much help as she could get when Will was sick."
Tears began to run down her face, and she buried her head in her lap.
When she stopped crying, she lifted her face.
Wade could see the fear in her eyes, and she looked like a small frightened kitten.
"Wade, I am in trouble.
Jake and I have to be married soon.
In a few weeks, I will start to show, and everyone will know."
Wade stared at her, unsure of what she meant then realization hit him.
She had spent time with a young man, whom he suddenly remembered she had mentioned on his last visit.
They had intended to be married, but had committed marital acts before the ceremony.
Now, because she had been left alone, she was in trouble that would not only reflect on her, but on her unborn child, and the rest of the family.
His mind raced, uncertain of solutions, but certain of where to place blame.
His mind raced back to the words of his mother so long ago when she relayed his responsibility to his younger sister.
He had not been here to protect his younger sister.
He had shirked his responsibilities in order to attend school which meant nothing now.
He was to blame for her misfortune, and he would have to find a solution somehow.
As he gazed at his sister sitting beside him, his pulse slowed as he realized that she was a scared young child with no where else to turn.
He delicately patted her hand, trying to comfort her, but she could not calm down until she knew that everything would be fine, and at this moment he had no guarantee.
"Don't worry, Ella, I will think of something.
