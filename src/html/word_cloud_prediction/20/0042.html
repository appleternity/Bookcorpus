Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

See the following: \'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  \'Is the economy in recession ?\' \'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI \' \'\'  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer\'s mind (construed as a Ground): \'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI\' \'I felt an unease inside me .\' \'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .\' \'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .\' \'\'  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): \'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .\' \'There are so many children in the family .\' \'\'  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: \'amid the confusion\' \'inside the competition period\' \'between lunch and dinner\' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word "period") while others can take events as Grounds directly. \'\'  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): \'In the paper , `` self-control \'\' is used to mean a sense of willpower .\' \'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .\' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. \'\' \'\'  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance.

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Have_associated', 'tfidf': 0.5095755163195376, 'lexical_unit': 'have.v / have got.v / with.prep', 'definition': "A Topical_entity has properties which are affected by the existence and association of an Entity.

Daylight from the Starsun now showed its healthy pale gleam through the windows.
The three travelers on the floor moaned in their misery as they worked their way to their feet.
Zain stood still in his shocked vigilance, war-hammer still in his hands.
The head of the hammer rested gently on an Emerald Orb, which sat high on a polished silver pedestal.
Dagen was the first to regain his feet.
The barbarian came to Zain's side and looked at the orb in confusion.
Sarik and Jase soon joined the others as they looked at the treasure, which they had come for.
"What happened?"
Jase asked.
His voice was almost a whimper.
Neither Sarik nor Dagen said anything.
They were waiting for Zain to answer.
The dwarf pursed his lips, not sure exactly what he should say.
Gathering his thoughts he finally said, "I think this tower was a weak point in the fabric of existence.
It was a portal perhaps, one that you could enter, but not exit.
I do not think we witnessed the Void, but I think we witnessed the Abyss and one of its overlords.
When studying at the monastery we were told how the minions of Devindal on many worlds could reach the Abyssal Plain.
It must be places like this where they cross over, save this point was not fully connected yet."
"Whatever it was," Sarik started, "the connection has been severed.
Let's take what we came for and leave this place.
