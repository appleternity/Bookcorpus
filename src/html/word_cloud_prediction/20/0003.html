'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI.

'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions.

'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

                        <pre>
There was to be a Temperance Meeting that evening in the Wesleyan Schoolroom, so Marjorie hurried away from Miss Macnab's tea table to take part in it.
The room was crowded, many working men and women filling up the seats.
First there were two short speeches, then Miss Louisa Marsh sang a Temperance song, then more speeches and stories, and then a song from Marjorie Mowbray.
This latter took the fancy of the women folk particularly, it was so sweet, so moving; and they urged their husbands and brothers to try and get her to sing again.
When Marjorie heard the clapping and the stamping and the calls for just another song, she wondered what she could sing them, for she had not brought the music of a second song with her.
"Do give them something else, Miss Marjorie," whispered John Weston.
"I believe not one of them will go to a whisky shop tonight."
Mr. Absalom Marsh had been bringing out a second set of papers on Joseph Addison in Cleanliness, and at the end of the last of the papers he had given a hymn written by that great man, as a proof of his godliness.
Marjorie had always liked that special hymn, and she had composed a tuneful chant to it for her own private singing.
This, she now resolved to let the audience hear.
Most of the men and women present read Cleanliness, so they would be familiar with the words.
She seated herself at the piano, facing the impatient audience, and sang "The Spacious Firmament on High," her splendid, well trained contralto voice echoing solemnly through the long room.
When she had finished, the applause was great.
"Why, 'tis the hymn as Master put in the paper this very week.
Paper says 'twas written by a great man as lived more'n a hundred years agone," said one of the men; while the women cried over Marjorie's grand, solemn voice, and felt awed and subdued in spite of themselves.
"If the hand as made us is divine, we'll let the beer shop be tonight," muttered some of the elder men.
"It would be a downright shame to go a-brawlin' and a -singin' artcr that 'ere grand thing."
So most of the audience went quietly and soberly past the public houses that night, and the solemn, beautiful voice of the singer, and the "sensible, splendid, reasonable words of that 'ere song," rang for many a day in the ears of the Market Hawley folk.
