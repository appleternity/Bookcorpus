Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). \'\' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called "round" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like "about", etc.   \'Only two senators voted in support of the president .\' \'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.\' \'We endured forty days of snow .\' \'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.\' \'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI\' \'The ship was three degrees off course .\'  \'\' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. "three hundred".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without "and", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  \'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI\' \'\' \'\' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\' \'There are just over six billion people in the world today.\'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., "3" is a wordform of three.num). \'\' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties ("A whopping three singers showed up")  \'\'  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between "six apples" and "six of the apples".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that "six of the apples" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like "six of the apples".

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Appellations', 'tfidf': 0.5688696379657909, 'lexical_unit': 'officer.n / general.n / captain.n / president.n / bishop.n / chairman.n / chairperson.n / chief.n / commander.n / commissioner.n / congressman.n / congresswoman.n / director.n / duchess.n / emperor.n / empress.n / executive.n / governor.n / headmaster.n / imam.n / kaiser.n / king.n / leader.n / legislator.n / maharaja.n / mayor.n / minister.n / mogul.n / monarch.n / official.n / premier.n / prince.n / principal.n / queen.n / representative.n / secretary.n / shah.n / sheik.n / sultan.n / superintendent.n / supervisor.n / tsar.n / mother.n / father.n / doctor.n / dr.n / mr.n / mrs.n / ms.n / miss.n / child.n / aunt.n / uncle.n / sister.n / brother.n / cousin.n', 'definition': "This frame is only for words that are used as the Titles of individuals.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read the it carefully.</span>
            <br/><br/>

He shook his head sadly.
What would someone want with it?
Teenagers' high jinks were getting worse nowadays.
Mindless thefts weren't the only thing worrying Mr Davis lately.
Spring should have been here by now, bringing the friendly sun along with her, yet it was raining again for the seventh day in a row.
England had always been a wet country, but this was ridiculous.
In response rain fell harder and harder till it seemed to attack the groaning earth.
Huge clouds of wet mud rose up, splattering the building, almost reaching higher windows.
Soon the place may flood.
Drains couldn't cope and his school couldn't afford to repair them.
Lost in such thoughts, Mr Davis jumped in surprise as the door burst open.
Lawrence stood there swaying.
His face was pale and sweaty.
The breathless boy breathed heavily, holding his chest.
Now they were out of danger Lucy sat down in the corner.
"Are you alright Lawrence?"
Mr Davis said, screwing his eyes up in concern.
Lawrence didn't look well at all.
His clothes were soaked through and thick with mud.
His clenched fist held a scruffy piece of paper tightly.
