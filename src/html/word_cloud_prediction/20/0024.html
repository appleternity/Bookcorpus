Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they\'re expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context.   \'The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy .\' \'I \'m sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand .\' \'I thought, like, maybe you would know .\' \'My father was something of a dilettante .\' \'He rather doubts you\'ll be able to convince your mom. \' \'\' Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:  \'Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side .\' \'\' There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following:  \'When a standard vaccuum can\'t even pick up the clods, you know you\'ve kinda got a problem.\' \'\' Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., "a tad", "a little", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number ("a little whiskey", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average ("a mite stupid", "somewhat confused" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category ("something of a klutz"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition ("I, like, waved it around").

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read the it carefully.</span>
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see two sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Not here,' she said.
Then taking him by the hand, she led him into the block of high-rise units she called home.
Inside her unit on the ground floor he again took her in his arms, but she pulled away, saying: 'No - time out!
I'll get us some drinks.
We both need to cool down a bit!'
She nipped into the kitchen and went straight to the fridge where she knew she had a bottle of sparkling wine she had put aside for any 'unexpected special occasion'.
She blushed at the thought that there could be no more 'special' an occasion than this.
She grabbed a couple of glasses and some nuts and some chips, spilling everything as she put them on the tray.
She then moved quickly back to the lounge, silently praying: 'God, please God, let him still be there'.
He was, having made himself more than comfortable on her settee.
She sat down near him, purposely choosing a nearby easy-chair to give her a bit of space and a chance to think.
Then she said, 'I suppose you know all about me - do you?'
'Yes, actually, I do.' he replied.
'I know everything there is to know about you, Dorothy Duke... darling.'
He reached out and took her hand.
'So there's no need to talk about me being too young for you, or any rubbish like that.
Don't even think it!'
'Alright, then.
But, come on, aren't you going to tell me your name and just a little bit about yourself?' she teased - as he popped the cork and poured the drinks.
'Ian Bright,' he said, simply.
