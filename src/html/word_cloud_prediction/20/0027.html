Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}, {'frame': 'Desiring', 'tfidf': 0.623478294568573, 'lexical_unit': 'want.v / desire.v / desire.n / desirous.a / lust.n / lust.v / hunger.v / hunger.n / hungry.a / thirst.n / thirst.v / thirsty.a / long.v / longing.n / urge.n / aspire.v / wish.n / wish (that).v / eager.a / hanker.v / hankering.n / aspiration.n / crave.v / craving.n / yearn.v / yen.n / yearning.n / wants.n / hope.v / hope.n / covet.v / covetous.a / will.v / wish.v / yen.v / ambition.n / feel like.v / interested.a / in the hope of.prep / raring.a / spoiling.a / dying.a / fancy.v / pine.v / ache.v / desired.a / will.n / itch.v / loath.a / reluctant.a / care.v / in hopes of.prep / impulse.n', 'definition': "An Experiencer desires that an Event occur.

These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that "forward" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    \'We went north . DNI\'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  \'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI\'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  \'Look left and you \'ll see it . DNI \'  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  \'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI\' \'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.\'  \'\'  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  \'??? The book faced above the door .\' vs. \'The book faced upward .\'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by "of", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  \'??? I faced east of the mountains .\'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word "to".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like "to the east", as well as "to both sides" and "to the rear".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is "potency" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  \'\' \'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .\' \'\'  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.'}, {'frame': 'Roadways', 'tfidf': 0.5721596175884116, 'lexical_unit': 'road.n / path.n / way.n / street.n / avenue.n / artery.n / highway.n / expressway.n / motorway.n / sidewalk.n / pavement.n / underpass.n / overpass.n / railway.n / railroad.n / route.n / line.n / crosswalk.n / bridge.n / tunnel.n / autobahn.n / lane.n / track.n / trail.n / boulevard.n / course.n / freeway.n / pathway.n / roadway.n / thoroughfare.n / byway.n / cul-de-sac.n / driveway.n / parkway.n / runway.n / bypass.n / flyover.n / rail.n', 'definition': "This frame involves stable Roadways which connect two stable Endpoints, the Source and the Goal.

I don't know if I will see my adoptive parents again, or if I will take any of their calls, reply to any of their emails.
I need time to understand, and I left behind a note saying so.
It's time for me to understand what you never told me - Iris I told Joshua I'll be fine, but now that I am alone on this plane I know the lie is bigger than I thought it would be when I said it.
I'm leaving all I have behind to look for a sister who might be dead.
Who might be somewhere where I'll never find her.
I have objective reasons to feel lonely, and being as physically drained as I am just makes the emotional chaos worse.
Sleep, Iris, sleep.
My eyes closed, I try to sleep.
But I can't, because I have the feeling that a guy is observing me.
I noticed him when I was lining up at the gate, his eyes somehow constantly brushing on me.
His gaze was not blunt enough for me to stand up and say, "hey stop it", it was rather the more subtle sideways type of gaze you can't argue against.
This man is the type you hope won't be sitting close to you, because if he does you'll never be able to push him away.
At first it seems like our seats are not close, but then he somehow manages to find his way to a spot not too far from where I'm sitting.
I wonder what he told the hostess to convince her to let him take a seat so bloody close to me.
As I sit with my eyes closed, I can't see the guy's eyes but I bet they're still slyly landscaping me.
Perhaps I'm being paranoid.
I sense that exhaustion is taking over...
"I thought you wouldn't come anymore", says Stephanie "How late am I?"
"About a month, but don't worry, we all know that last minutes accidents happen", she says and laughs "I can't believe the flight took so long.
I'm sorry..."
