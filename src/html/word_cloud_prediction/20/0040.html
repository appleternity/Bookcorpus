Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why "at the store" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case "in the store" would be more usual).  \'We are now at the cathedral .\' \'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .\' \'I \'m at my mother \'s .\'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  \' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .\' \'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .\' \'At fifty dollars , everyone \'s gonna buy one !\' \'If you \'re only at page 20 , just start over .\' '}, {'frame': 'Giving', 'tfidf': 0.5050170957233123, 'lexical_unit': 'give.v / donate.v / donation.n / donor.n / foist.v / endow.v / fob off.v / give out.v / hand over.v / hand out.v / gift.v / gift.n / pass out.v / bequeath.v / treat.v / hand.v / hand in.v / contribute.v / contribution.n / charity.n / volunteer.v / will.v / leave.v / advance.v / confer (upon).v / bequest.n', 'definition': "A Donor transfers a Theme from a Donor to a Recipient.

It says it right there, we here at United Media Corp. have a zero-tolerance policy for racism."
She spoke rapid fire.
"I know what the policy is!
What on earth did I do that was racist?
And I'm Asian!
Doesn't that at least count for something anymore?"
"Yes, you being Asian definitely counts for something.
But unfortunately, it doesn't give you free reign to blatantly disrespect African-Americans.
You see African-Americans have had a unique experience in American history."
She paused a moment.
"Editor Bernstein told me about the last article you wrote."
She picked up a copy of his article from her desk and read.
"African-Americans make up 13% of the population, but commit 52% of the crime."
She looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
"Care to explain why you wrote that?"
"Because it is a verifiable fact."
