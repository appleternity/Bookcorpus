The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}];

I picked it up before I shoved my pointed heel into it.
Marco wasn't so lucky.
"Watch out," the Sister said a fraction too late.
Marco's heel shunted down as the floorboard gave way.
He just managed to save his balance as he pumped his appreciable muscles and flapped his arms.
"This place is a health hazard," he muttered under his breath.
Years of managing unruly orphans had obviously sharpened the Sister's hearing so she could pick up even the most whispered of mutters.
"This orphanage has been passed as fit for purpose, Officer.
We rely on donations now that the government cut us off.
As such, we daren't waste a penny on any frivolous expenses."
Though I wanted to hear everything the Sister had to say, at the same time, I couldn't ignore that twitch in the pit of my stomach.
It roared at me that the light was close by, and it was not playing by the rules.
Standing at the mouth of the Sister's open door, I tried not to clutch my hand into a fist.
Marco had already walked past me, and he turned on his foot, the soles of his cheap shoes squeaking.
"Coming in?"
"Actually, I really need to use the bathroom.
If you wouldn't mind?"
I asked the Sister.
Further cementing the fact that she preferred me over Marco, she shot me a charming smile.
"I'm afraid you have to go one level up.
They're not in the best of repair.
There's a sign on the door."
I nodded.
"I'll try not to get lost."
"Sorry, dear, this is an old power building, and it's a bit of a warren.
I'm sure we'll be done by the time you're back.
Probably best to just meet us at the front door."
With that, the Sister turned her less than pleased gaze on Marco.
As I closed the door behind me, I fixed my attention on Marco's pressed-lip frown.
For a man of the cloth like him, getting on the wrong side of a saintly Sister who selflessly managed an orphanage would be like taking the Lord's name in vain.
But hey, he'd already done that today, so here was to hoping he'd break even more rules by nightfall.
As soon as the door was closed and I was on my own, I let my eyes practically roll into the back of my head and brought my fingers out of my pockets.
I placed them beside me and slowly twiddled them back and forth, the edges of my usually short nails scraping over the fabric of my pants.
I wasn't twiddling my fingers back and forth because I was trying to pick up the ever-persistent, percussive beat of the bad plumbing in this place.
Though the Sister had been vague in letting me know where the bathroom was, anyone with a functioning set of ears would be able to track it.
Someone had obviously just gone, and at the effort of pumping water through the building, it sounded like every pipe was about to burst.
Every single time I twiddled my fingers in and out, I was grabbing invisible strings.
No, I hadn't just turned mad.
I was attempting to assess the energies of this place.
As I twisted my fingers in and out, I disturbed them.
It was the equivalent of trying to scratch and sniff.
"There you are," I muttered under my breath as I pushed off, my eyes still partially closed.
Fortunately either the kids were out for an excursion or all of them were at school - because I couldn't pick up their voices.
It didn't take long to find the stairs.
They stuck out like a sore thumb just past the narrow hall that led to the front door.
I frowned as I remembered that the Sister had called this place an old electricity substation.
That didn't make much sense.
Such buildings were usually quite open affairs.
Which made you question why an architect had swept in here and closed the place off with walls and rooms.
It was the equivalent of taking an open hand and closing it tightly.
"Maze trap," I muttered to myself under my breath, repeating a very well-known line of magical fact.
Though the Sister had admitted that this building was like a virtual warren, I could appreciate the difference between a place with walls, ceilings, and importantly, obvious doors, compared to an actual maze.
Not the point.
Sometimes energies could get trapped.
Confuse them with enough objects, and you can find things concentrating.
As I took to the stairs, I dipped down onto one knee, swept a hand forward, and picked up several chunks of fluff from the carpet.
I wasn't a neat freak.
By any stretch of the imagination.
Sure, I kept my cards and crystals and herbs and oils neat out of decency, but you should see my sink and my closet.
Both were overgrown with dishes and clothes that were in desperate need of a wash.
As I trailed that chunk of carpet through my fingers, I felt it.
Half closing my eyes, I got the very clear and distinct image of an angel walking on this very carpet only several hours ago.
I saw the wings, I saw the strong, svelte build, the tapered shoulders, the sharp features.
Though angels, like demons, could pass for humans during the day - if they had their disguises on - angels stuck out more.
It was their sharp features, the piercing quality to their gazes, the fact they looked like elongated models.
I get it, believe Christian fiction, and angels are meant to be these heavenly, beautiful creatures wafting around in excessive mounds of white fabric with halos adorning their bouncing locks.
Real angels are a heck of a lot sharper.
Because real angels are warriors.
As I saw a flash of this particular angel, I appreciated I didn't recognize him.
Which was fair enough.
Unlike Thanatos and some of his demon brethren in town, the angels were switched out more regularly.
Father Butler's angelic army came and went as he saw fit.
The creep who'd walked these halls a mere two and a half hours ago, if I was any judge, was larger than most angels, broader in the chest, longer in the face, and importantly, sharper in the gaze.
Angels are glorified predators, their every sense directed at the task of finding holes in people's heads and exploiting them for the work of the divine.
With sharp gazes and strong noses, you could easily confuse them with bad guys out of Disney films.
I finally reached the top of the stairs.
I had to come to a decision, didn't I?
If I came across an angel doing work it shouldn't under the Dictates, I had every right to go after him, even in an orphanage.
Sure, Father Butler would complain just as much as Thanatos had this morning - though without the sexual innuendo - but there'd be nothing he'd be able to do to me.
On the other hand, Marco was downstairs.
I couldn't afford to get into a lengthy battle, or a loud one.
As I rounded a corner, stopping next to the bathroom I didn't need to use, my mind was made up for me.
I saw the back of an angel.
He was dressed in a black trench coat, the fabric skimming along his long, powerful legs.
Though I couldn't see his face from here, at the end of the corridor was a large window that looked down into a side street.
It was reflective, and I caught a glimpse of the bastard's eyes.
"Harbinger," he hissed.
I hated that term.
As he used it, a mix of fear and loathing slammed down my back and struck my stomach as if the scumbag had punched me from afar.
That's what the light called me, see.
Harbinger of doom.
They, just like the Devil, believed that one day I would bring destruction to the city, and then, the world.
"Yeah, well, you can tell me whatever you want.
Just as I can tell you to stop.
You've got no right to be messing in the lives of these children, angel," I spat.
"You are a disappointment, Harbinger," every time he said that word, his tongue became sharper, practically making it sound as if he was whipping the word out of the air.
"The light has offered you to join it many times.
And it will be your only redemption.
Seek it now, not later.
For later, it will be--" "Too late?
It's already too late for you," I said as I took a step forward, rounded a hand into a fist, and tapped it against my palm.
If anyone had been paying attention with a sharp ear, they would be able to tell that particular thwack echoed out in more than one realm.
So far the man had been having a conversation with me with his back turned.
Now, slowly, the move grating as if his neck was made out of some stiff, immovable substance, he turned.
He was wearing glasses.
They were dark wraparound shades that made him look as if he were some extremely important celebrity who couldn't afford to be seen in this shit-house orphanage.
In reality, they'd be hiding his eyes.
Just like Thanatos, angels - especially as big and powerful as this guy - had problems controlling the illumination behind their vision.
It was just plain easier to hide their eyes behind Ray Bands than it was to spell every single human they passed to ensure no one saw them for what they truly were.
"Now, are you going to answer what you're doing here and tell me what you have to do with those disappearances?
Or are you gonna run?"
I got my answer when the shit put on a burst of speed and sailed right through the window in front of him.
There was no halo of glass.
Just like demons, angels could choose what level of reality they interacted with.
And thankfully this bastard was smart enough to appreciate that crashing through a window in an orphanage during the middle of the day would raise eyebrows on the street outside.
"Great," I muttered to myself as I picked up the equivalent of my skirts and ran for it.
I got two steps before I turned the dial halfway to the left.
Not all the way.
Yeah, sure, this guy was a big angel, but I assumed he wouldn't fight, just run.
My assumptions would be wrong.
Chapter 7 I was not a demon or an angel - not anymore, anyway.
I couldn't choose what matter I interacted with.
You know what I could do?
Jimmy open a window.
The floor-to-ceiling window the angel had pushed himself through was not the kind you could open.
Though this orphanage had some of the worst maintenance I'd ever seen, the Sister had proudly proclaimed that it had successfully passed its safety inspection.
Meaning the window was locked closed.
But with a single twist of my immortal grip, the lock shattered in my hand, I heaved the window open, and I jumped through.
Angels and demons could become invisible, should they choose to.
It was trickier with me.
I wouldn't exactly call it becoming invisible - but I could become see-through, if you will.
No, I didn't suddenly strip back my skin cells and muscle and bone and walk around like a picture on an x-ray.
Let's call it being invisible save for the direct glimpse of a knowing gaze.
Confused?
Don't be.
Some people are vaguely aware that more realms exist than that of humans.
I'm not talking about your average kooky mystic.
I'm talking about people who've seen things, who've experienced the unexplainable.
Maybe they had a near-death experience - maybe they're travelers in their dreams.
It doesn't really matter where it comes from, the point is they're less inclined to believe that angels and demons can't exist.
It's these people you've gotta watch out for.
If I ran in front of one of those, my body sparking with the light of my soul, they'd be able to see.
Your average everyday citizen, on the other hand, would probably blink once, then twice, then dismiss it as a trick of the light.
Fortunately, this orphanage backed off into a seriously cramped laneway that couldn't be called anything more than breathing space between two buildings.
Though there were some other windows that looked down at it from the orphanage, as I'd already said, no one was home.
So there was no one to see as I slammed down onto the asphalt, my heels protesting with two thwacks as I cracked the bitumen with hairline fissures.
I shook my head, my hair flaring over my shoulder.
Fortunately, either this angel was slow, or had a death wish, as he hadn't managed to run the distance between the buildings and out onto the main road beyond.
It gave me all the chance I needed.
I jerked my foot to the side, collecting a loose stone that had fallen from the orphanage.
