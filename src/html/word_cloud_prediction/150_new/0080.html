The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

There's a real hardness to him, even a meanness."
"I'm seeing a different side of him too.
Even when I lived here, I didn't see him like this.
I ignored what he did and how he lived.
I was too concerned about myself to think about him.
I knew he liked a certain kind of woman, like Ella.
I remember meeting some of them, but he never dated any of them for very long.
They all looked like Ella, but she's really the best looking of them all.
I knew some of them stayed over because I would hear talking or laughter or the sound of sex coming from his bedroom, but I didn't usually see them.
It was like he snuck them in and out.
I didn't know what a good businessman he was.
I just knew he was always making money, lots of it."
"Tommy, if we don't know who your father is, I certainly don't know who I am anymore.
I feel like I'm losing myself.
It's not just the move - it's everything.
I could always think of myself as this sweet teacher who loves everyone.
That's not me anymore.
I can't stop what's happening to me.
I'm changing and I don't know who I'm becoming because this is going to last for a while.
I feel like I'm on an out-of-control roller coaster and I don't know what I'll be like until the ride stops."
"Yeah, I feel that way too, but not as much as you probably.
We'll both be changed by what we've learned about ourselves and the move, but we'll come out the same people in the end.
You'll always love people, but not everyone.
You'll be more discriminating.
I suppose you're losing your innocence, and that was one thing I loved about you.
"Does that mean you'll love me less?"
"No.
Never.
I could never love you any less than I do."
Although Leslie was soundly asleep in the pack and play, he whispered softly "Good night my wife and sister."
Hannah murmured, "Good night my husband and brother."
Chapter 11
When Tommy and Hannah's plane landed in Virginia, they felt a bitter-sweet pleasure at being back in their lovely, soon-to-be-former home and trepidation about how convincing their concocted story would be.
They gazed forlornly at the velvety green, gently-sloping mountains that greeted them, trying to block out the memory of the white streaked, jagged mountains they had left behind.
They had carefully rehearsed the facade of lies they would present to the world.
Kelly would be the first test case to hear their work of fiction.
Tommy didn't want Hannah to talk to her alone; he didn't trust her to be able to carry off their deceit.
He was filled with resolve to present a flawless story that no one would have reason to question.
Although he knew it was highly implausible, he feared someone might suspect the true reason behind their move.
When they drove up to their house at 76 Vista Road, Leslie shouted happily, "My house.
I gonna see Spot and Puff.
Yeah!"
After they brought her into the house, she rushed to the living room which had been transformed into a playroom.
After hugging each of her dolls and saying "I'm home" repeatedly, she immersed herself in her toy kitchen, cooking spaghetti for her hungry dolls seated at the child-size table and chairs.
No more scary dogs, cold weather, and people talking in angry voices.
She was safe, if only for a little while.
Spot and Puff appeared, meowing a welcome home greeting.
Leslie chased them from room to room.
Obviously, they had been lonely since they uncharacteristically showed themselves.
Hannah went to the greenhouse and cried out for Tommy.
He ran after her shouting, "What's the matter?"
"One of my orchids died.
We were gone for only five days and it died."
She gently stroked the wilting leaves and browned flowers.
"Poor Kelly will think it's her fault.
It's not.
It's because I'm going to leave them.
All my flowers and plants are going to die.
They can't survive without me.
They know I'm deserting them."
"That's the most bizarre thing I've ever heard.
How the hell would your flowers know you're leaving?"
"I don't know, but I've never lost an orchid before.
You know I have a way of communicating with my plants."
Tommy gave her a look as if to say she were nuts.
"Yeah, you're the plant whisperer."
They had called Kelly on their way home from the airport, and asked her to come over when she was free.
Fifteen minutes later, Kelly rang the bell.
As Hannah opened the door, she asked, "Why didn't you use your key?"
"Oh I thought you might be talking or doing something private.
Here's your key back.
I think it's a good idea for me not to be able to come in whenever I want."
Hannah didn't dispute this.
Kelly shouldn't have a key.
Only members of the Evans should freely enter their home.
"Look at my left hand."
She raised her hand, rotating it to catch the light reflections from the large diamond gracing her ring finger.
"Kelly, you're engaged!
What a huge rock!
When did this happen?"
"Last night.
Brad proposed and I thought I would try marriage again.
I do love him and I know he's wild about me.
I told him I'd only marry him if we could have a baby.
A baby like your wonderful Leslie, and he agreed to start a new family even though his kids are 12 and 14 and he'd have to go through the all night feedings and all the other negatives of parenthood, but he knows the positives far outweigh them.."
Tommy came in. "Hey, what's the good news I hear?
Wow!
What a rock!
Congratulations.
Brad's a great guy and I know you'll be happy."
He gave her a warm kiss and hug.
Kelly picked Leslie up and said, "I missed you, gorgeous girl.
What did you do when you were in Alaska?"
"I was on airplane up in the sky.
Grandpa has bad doggies.
Big teeth and big tongues.
I sleep with Mommy and Daddy.
" Leslie continued describing the details of the trip until Hannah distracted her with her toys so they could talk
"Hannah, we're going to have a small wedding, and I want you to be my maid of honor.
Of course, there's no one else I want but you.
We're getting married over the Fourth of July.
And I'd like Leslie to be my flower girl."
Tommy said, "That'll be a good time for us because it'll be right before we move.
We're moving to Alaska this summer.
We're moving for good."
Kelly's whole body jolted with shocked disbelief.
"What?
You're not serious.
Why're you moving?"
"My dad's ill.
You know he had a heart attack, but the doctors think he'll make a good recovery eventually.
He wants me to take over his business."
"But you hated Alaska."
"I have to do this for my father."
"Can't he come here?"
"He has all his businesses there.
I'm going to take them over."
"Why don't you just sell them?"
"I want to run them."
"Why?
For the money?
I never thought you were interested in money."
"Kelly, get real.
Everybody's interested in money."
"Hannah, how can you leave your mother?"
"Her mother's a vegetable and won't know."
"I'm talking to Hannah."
"And I'm answering for her."
"Hey, I don't know what's happening here, but I don't like it.
You're totally controlling Hannah.
You're not even letting her talk.
Hannah, talk to me."
"Tommy can speak for me.
Whatever he says is what I feel."
"God, you're like a robot.
Something has happened in your life and you're not letting me in on it.
You've never hidden anything before.
We've been so close.
We've been family.
Now we're not, and I don't know why.
And it's breaking my heart."
"Kelly, we've been as close as sisters and I love you.
I love you so much that I want you to raise Leslie if anything happens to us.
I would trust you with my most precious possession."
"What's going to happen to you?"
"Nothing.
But what happens if we had a car accident on a slippery road in Alaska?
Ben's older and not in good health.
He couldn't raise her.
I know you would love her like your own child."
