The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

"Be home by eleven."
His dad said.
Turning to June he remarked, "Why the school decided to have this dance on a school night is beyond me.
When I was growing up they only had them on Friday nights."
Turning around briefly Jack replied, "Can't I make it twelve".
"Last I checked eleven meant eleven."
** Disappointing Dance **
Sighing Jack opened his car door and got in. Turning the key the starter made its sound that it sometimes made.
That lovely grinding sound he hated to hear.
Man, I have to get that fixed one of these days he thought to himself.
Turning the key again the engine caught and soon he was cruising down the road heading for the school where the dance should have already begun.
At least the school started the dance earlier than Friday night dances so there was plenty of time to mingle and dance.
He would have listened to the radio but that didn't work either.
Once again Jack thought to himself.
I have really got to get that fixed also.
Pulling into the school lot he noticed a lot of cars already there.
Oh well, better late than never.
"Jackie my boy, I see that you are fashionably late again.
Just like you will be at the finish line," Charles said who had been waiting in the doorway for Jack.
"Of course I am, you know you have to be to make an entrance.
Is Julia here yet?"
"Yup, but I think that she was pulling your leg by telling you yes last week.
She's in there with her old boyfriend John.
It looks like her and John are back together again for the billionth time.
If they were any closer together dancing they would look like one person."
Jacks jaw dropped open before he realized that it had.
"Wouldn't you know it?
You'd think that she would have learned by now.
All the guy does is mess around on her once he's got her back.
By tomorrow he's going to be with Jill, Janey, Betty, or any one of them.
Heck, maybe all of them at once."
He could never understand what she saw in the guy.
He was never going to change.
After all why would he if he knows that all he has to do is snap his fingers and there would be Julia by his side again.
Shrugging Charles said, "Oh well easy come easy go.
Jack why did you even ask her?
Do you enjoy setting yourself up like a stooge or something?
You had to have known that this was coming.
When a dance is here who else does he want at his side but Julia?
Also who always comes running to his side?
Julia."
Being bummed out Jack did not really enjoy the dance no matter what Charles did and his other buddies did to try and cheer him up.
He just could not drag himself out of the funk he was in.
He was also dreading tomorrow at school because he knew that John would be giving it his best effort to make Jack feel even more miserable.
Thank goodness it would be Friday.
He decided to go ahead and leave the dance early so that John could not get an early start on him.
** Thats Life **
Jack used the back door to sneak into the house so his mom and dad would not ask any embarrassing questions about why he was home so early.
Quietly he went into his bedroom and lay on his bed to read, and then he would sneak out the back door again and come in through the front door.
Right at eleven that is what he did.
Jack told them he was tired and went directly to his bedroom for the second time in one night.
Then he got ready for bed and lay down and went into a troubled sleep.
"Something's coming Jack, we need your help."
With a bolt Jack sat up in his bed looking around he saw no one and laid back down thinking it was a dream.
Nothing more woke him up that night.
Sharply at six, his alarm clock went off waking him.
Groggily he got dressed for school and went out to the kitchen to grab some breakfast.
"How was the dance last night?
You went by so fast that we didn't get a chance to ask you," his mom asked?
"It was ok," Jack replied and turned back to his bowl of cereal.
His mom knew when not to ask any more questions so she left Jack alone.
Jack finished his breakfast and left for school.
He needed to get there early so he could finish his homework from the day before that didn't get done last night.
Going to study hall he did that.
By then it was about time for the bell to ring so he went on to his first period class.
He went through the day mechanically taking notes when he should but not participating in answering any questions.
During lunch Charles once again tried to raise Jacks spirits.
But between the dance and being woke up by the voice last night (he was starting to believe that maybe he did hear something) he was out of luck.
Finally Charles gave up and walked away allowing Jack to sit there, pick at his food and mope.
Jack also ignored John's constant ribbing at every chance he got.
When the last bell finally rang, he was free to go home.
Reaching the student parking lot he got in his car and started it with no problem this time.
On his way home he suddenly decided to detour and go by the park.
Maybe turning a few laps in would make him feel better.
If nothing else he could put his mind in neutral while jogging and just forget everything for a while.
It turned out that twice around the park did improve his outlook on life.
It usually did.
Also he got to looking forward to helping his dad tomorrow.
He was going to do something that he was good at - putting the edges on a few swords and honing them.
He was also going to try his hand at some decorative etching.
He would also be checking them for balance by hand.
Something that he was very good at.
Feeling much better he hopped back in his car and headed for home.
When he walked through the front door his mom and dad cornered him immediately.
He could tell by the look on their faces that he was not going to be able to wiggle out of this situation by simply going to his room.
They meant to talk, and wanted him to talk with them.
He was going to try to come up with some story but he knew that they would be able to see right through him.
Sighing he stopped and looked at them.
"Alright, what's been eating you the past couple of days?"
his dad asked.
Jack shrugged his shoulders and looking at them said, "I had a lousy time at the dance.
The girl I had asked to go with me wound up with someone else.
I was just bummed out for awhile."
"That's all there is to it, all this over a girl?
Well I won't give you one of my when I was your age speeches, but I really do know where you are coming from.
Just believe me that you will live and get over it.
More will come into your life.
I never thought that I would meet anyone that could be serious about me.
Then I met your mom."
"Dad you don't have to get all mushy with me.
I do know that I will live, and that there will be other girls in my life.
But this one just caught me off guard.
Can I go to my room now?
I am pretty tired and I would like to be fresh for my jogging in the morning."
"Fine, go on then, I agree with your dad and you.
You'll live to fight another day."
Everyone said their good nights and Jack went on to his room.
In his room he closed his door and got ready for bed.
Turning on his stereo, he thought at least this one works.
He listened to one of the new female artists sing one of her songs to a great beat.
Before he knew it he had fallen asleep.
"Jack, it's coming and we desperately need your help!"
Coming wide-awake and jumping out of bed he looked around.
Once again he saw no one in his room.
He walked over to the stereo and turned it off.
There was no way that the voice had come out of it.
That's not anything that a DJ would say and he knew of no songs that had those words in them.
Scratching his head and wondering if he had been dreaming again he hopped back into bed.
As he lay in bed he had the uneasy feeling that he had really heard the feminine sounding voice.
Lying back and relaxing he had an odd feeling.
Once again he fell into slumber.
On Saturdays he usually woke about eight, but this time he slept to about nine.
Waking, he went ahead and put on his jogging clothes.
He grabbed a light breakfast and he decided today that he was going to pick up the training even more so he took two one-pound weights.
One to hold in each hand as he jogged.
Then he headed out the door to the park.
** Jack's Arrival **
When he reached the park he noticed that this was such a perfect day, there was more than the average amount of park dwellers at the tables.
He was clipping along at a decent pace when suddenly there was a pain in his side just under his lower ribs.
Great he thought, not even at the two-mile mark and already getting a stitch in my side.
He pulled up short with his hand clasped at where it hurt.
When he stopped the dizziness hit.
Seeing black and gray spots dance before his eyes, he bent over hoping to stop the onslaught of the now nauseating feeling he was getting.
Oh man he thought, I must have been pushing myself way to hard.
He never saw the ground as it came up to meet him, and the park dwellers were all involved with what they were doing so none saw him fade into dimness, then to nothingness at all.
The first thing that he noticed when he opened his eyes was that he thought he must have rolled off the jogging path because he was lying in the grass.
The next thought to hit him was that the city grounds keepers needed to do a better mowing job because the grass was getting pretty long in his little patch that he had landed on.
He felt better, but a little sheepish and hoping that no one had seen him pass out like that.
Pushing himself up to stand he bent over and brushed the grass from his pants and shirt.
Looking up the landscaping around him was unfamiliar--- what the hell and no way!?!?
In that little glance up shock and confusion tumbled right his way and rolled over him.
Turning slowly in a complete circle he took in his new environment.
No more jogging path, no more trees, no more benches, and where in the world were the park dwellers?
Instead he saw soft rolling hills covered over with grass.
In the distance there was what looked like a small lake with light shimmering off of its surface.
The air smelled funny, and then he realized that the odor that was always present in the air at home was gone.
Fresh country air must be what I am smelling he thought.
The sky was a deep blue with a few wispy clouds high up, one like he had never seen before.
Besides the confusion he began to feel threads of fear crawl up his spine.
Also present with his feelings there came a certain awe of the beauty that surrounded him.
