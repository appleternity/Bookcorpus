The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

"No, I've no idea at all.
I don't even know what branch of service it will be, although, since my father served in the army during The Great War, I suppose that is the most likely possibility."
"This is absolutely shocking.
We must have a going away party for you."
"That isn't necessary, James."
"Perhaps, but I'd like to do it anyway, with your permission, of course."
"Alright, but please don't go to any trouble."
The Following Evening
Sloan stood silently by the wharf, contemplating in the fading rays of sunshine the unknown that lay before him.
In less than thirty-six hours he would be boarding the Fremont in this very harbor, bound for England and a world at war.
Suddenly the click of feminine heels on pavement drew him back and, turning to his left he saw her approaching, a smile spreading across her otherwise forlorn features.
"Sloan!
Dear Sloan," she managed to blurt before grasping him in a tight embrace, a flood of tears staining her smile, "We must make the most of tonight.
It may be our last for a long while."
Desperately holding back tears of his own, all he could bear to respond was, "Isolde, dear Isolde."
The pair dined at Clambake, one of Boston's finest seafood restaurants, something they would never have thought of doing under normal circumstances.
But of course, this wasn't a normal circumstance at all.
After they had completed their repast, the mood turning solemn, Isolde exclaimed disconsolately, "I don't understand, I thought your father had arranged for you to remain in school here in the United States."
At this he responded introspectively, "Yes, I thought so too, but there are limits to his political powers, Isolde, and the situation in Europe has deteriorated significantly.
What with the capitulation of France, the advance of the Germans in North Africa, and the attack on Russia in the East, the Allies are in dire straits.
The Axis powers could well take all of Europe and Asia before long."
"It all seems so far away," she murmured, suggesting, "Surely the United States won't be drawn into it."
"Don't be so sure of that," he replied, "This war is far from over.
Look what happened in the Great War.
Both sides thought it would end in a matter of months, but it lasted more than four years, and millions upon millions of lives were lost.
And to be honest, it appears that Hitler and his henchmen will not rest until they've had their full revenge."
Drawing one hand to her throat, Isolde exclaimed, "Now you're scaring me!
You could get wounded, or worse, Sloan!"
"There is that, but there is nothing at all that can be done about it, dear Isolde.
I must report, or I face a court martial for draft evasion.
I'm afraid that, given the two alternatives, the former is the only reasonable course of action.
So I'm bound for England on tomorrow's tide, I'm afraid."
"I can't stand it!"
she exclaimed.
"How shall I go on without you, dear Sloan!"
"You must, and you shall.
And for my part, I shall promise to come back, when it's all over.
Should I survive this war, I promise to return to Boston."
She eyed him mournfully, then mumbled, "I suppose that is all one could expect," and, contemplating for a moment, she added, "What about Sabrina?"
"What about her?"
he inquired dismissively.
"Don't you want to see her before you go?"
"I doubt that she would see me even if I tried, after the events of the summer.
Besides, there isn't time for me to go to Pennsylvania."
"But you adore her, Sloan.
Anyone can see that!"
"Isolde, let us not concern ourselves with personal feelings at this juncture in time.
Whatever any of us feels at this moment, with time the war shall change everything.
When it is all over, we may consider our own emotions, but for now, duty must take the forefront."
"What a load of unmitigated balderdash!"
she responded bluntly, "Wherever on earth did you come up with that?"
He peered dejectedly at her for a moment, then offered, "From my father, Isolde.
He lived through the most horrible war in the history of humankind and, having lost a leg, he came home from the war and sought out his long-lost love, only to find her on her death bed, dying from the influenza epidemic.
He somehow righted his life thereafter, married her sister, who became my mother I might add, and has subsequently enjoyed a long and happy life."
At this she stared at him in wonder and murmured, "Well, that may be, but I know how I feel, and I shall feel thusly forever."
"Right, as you should," he offered and, placing his hand over hers, he repeated, "As you should.
Now, I must be on my way, dear Isolde."
"May I see you off, Sloan?"
"Please - no, Isolde.
This setting is so much more fitting.
Can we let this be the place of parting?"
"Yes, I suppose you are right," she responded, tears now streaming down her face yet again, "Alright then, give us a hug, dear friend."
And at this he did her bidding, subsequently turning to leave.
As he strode away she murmured, "Bye, dear Sloan, dear dear Sloan," but he was already beyond earshot.
Off the coast of Newfoundland - September 7
Fast asleep within his bunk, Sloan was awakened by the sound of an enormous explosion, thereby assuring him that the ship had been struck by a torpedo launched from a German U-Boat.
Having prepared for just such a possibility, he quickly bounded from bed, feeling the ship already listing noticeably to starboard.
He had read about the situation in the North Atlantic, hundreds of Allied and American ships already having been sunk by the Germans.
He had even imagined what he might do if he were aboard a sinking ship, in this, a war unlike any other.
He was therefore rather better prepared than most of the other three hundred passengers aboard the ship.
Accordingly, he quickly dressed in his warmest clothing, placing his valuables within his coat pocket, and made for the deck as rapidly as humanly possible.
He was one of the first passengers to reach the lifeboats, and none too soon, for the torpedo had struck amidships, blasting through two of the ship's main bulkheads in the process.
An officer motioned frantically to him as he came alongside the life boat, screaming, "Hurry, man!
The ship's going down!
Anyone onboard this ship in five minutes is going to the bottom alongside the Titanic!
Hurry, man!"
At this, Sloan paled, replying, "Shouldn't we wait for the women and children?"
"What women and children?
There are very few of them onboard this ship!
Not many are willing to chance the crossing for the very reason that we are faced with at this moment.
Now, there's no time to lose.
Get aboard the lifeboat, now!"
At this, Sloan scampered over the side, jumping haphazardly into the boat alongside several other terrified looking passengers.
Several more passengers followed and, the boat now little more than half full, the officer ordered, "Lower away!"
Sloan called out, "But we're only half full, sir!"
"Shut up!
Lower away!"
the officer ordered yet again, and the boat suddenly lurched downwards.
Moments later the bow slapped the surface of the Atlantic, Sloan noticing that it was an unusually calm night on the open sea.
Several of the passengers within the lifeboat now grabbed oars, Sloan included, and pulled as quickly as possible away from the rapidly sinking ship, in hopes of reaching far enough away to avoid being capsized by the ship when it went down.
Sloan watched as two more lifeboats were launched, then a third, and finally a fourth, but that was the last one launched, the ship going down half a minute thereafter.
He gazed in distress as two partially launched lifeboats fell sideways into the sea, expelling their passengers as the ship went down.
Just before the ship disappeared beneath the surface, he watched in horror as several people jumped over the side.
"Hurry!"
Sloan shouted to his fellow passengers, "We've got to get back to the ship!
There may be survivors!"
But to his amazement, the remaining occupants simply halted rowing, stunned into immobility by the horrifying scene unfolding before them.
Grabbing an oar, he tugged on it desperately, but to no avail.
It simply wasn't possible for one person to row several hundred yards back toward the spot where the ship had gone down.
As it was, the screams from the dying ended shortly thereafter, all having quickly perished from the freezing cold waters of the North Atlantic.
There were by this point several men moaning onboard the lifeboat, as well as one middle aged woman wailing at the top of her lungs.
Pushing his way over to her side, Sloan commanded, "Please madam, control yourself!"
Ignoring his entreaty, she kept on wailing.
He summarily leaned forward and, slapping her soundly, he exclaimed, "Shut up!
If you want to live through this night, stop wailing, madam," at which, staring at him in shock, she abruptly stopped.
Sloan then turned to the remaining passengers and inquired, "Anyone know anything about boating?"
As no one responded, he inquired, "Anyone know how to swim?"
Several of the passengers raised their hands, and at this revelation, Sloan exclaimed, "Good!
Now, I've read a bit about the Titanic, and if memory serves, there was another ship not too far off, and those who were lucky enough to escape in the lifeboats were rescued by morning.
So I suggest we all batten down the hatches, and await sunrise as calmly as possible."
"What does 'batten down the hatches' mean?"
one young man queried inanely.
Glancing in his direction, Sloan responded authoritatively, "It means, stay low and keep as warm as possible."
"Right.
Got it," the young man responded, clearly pacified by Sloan's self-assurance.
Thereafter, the forlorn group spent the entire night on the open sea, the temperature hovering just above freezing.
By sunrise it was apparent that, due to the frigid temperature and the lack of warm clothing worn by the passengers, they would not last long before the situation would become dire indeed.
Hoping to ward off the inevitable, Sloan announced, "Alright!
Everyone wake up!
Now, swing your arms to and fro, like this!"
At this, one young man moaned lethargically, "Why ever for?
I'm cold!"
"Precisely!"
Sloan commanded, "Get those arms moving!
Everyone, get the blood flowing.
Help should be here soon!"
at which one of his charges began to do his bidding, followed shortly thereafter by the remaining few.
Toward mid-morning they heard the sound of a ship's horn and, gazing in the direction of the sound, they saw a ship steaming their way.
The survivors suddenly began screaming and waving frantically in fear that their rescuer would fail to see them.
The ship continued straight toward them, affecting their rescue shortly thereafter.
Although more than three-fourths of those on board had gone down with the ship, all those in Sloan's care survived.
St. Johns, Newfoundland - The Following Day
Sloan sat listlessly within the warehouse, relieved to simply be out of the blowing gale without.
They had been issued blankets, along with a warm breakfast, and now the passengers were simply awaiting their fate, whatever it might be.
As he waited, wondering how long he would be forced to remain in Newfoundland, an American officer came forward and inquired, "Are you Mr. Stewart, sir?"
"Yes, I am," Sloan replied, standing as he did so.
The officer said, "You are to be commended, sir.
Several others who were in your lifeboat claim that you saved their lives."
"I doubt that, sir," Sloan denied, "I did what anyone would have done under the circumstances."
"Still, you are the one who took charge, Mr. Stewart," and so saying, the officer saluted him and, holding out a congratulatory hand, he posited, "I understand that you are on your way to England to report for military duty.
Is that correct?"
Taking the proffered hand, Sloan responded politely, "Yes, sir, that is indeed correct."
"Excellent.
It so happens, we have a military aircraft at the airfield at this very moment, sir, and it is on its way to Shannon, from whence it will fly to England.
There happens to be room onboard for one additional military person, and you being the only one available at the moment, I am instructed to inform you that you may make the passage by air forthwith, sir."
"Oh, that is splendid!"
Sloan replied.
"We must make haste, Mr. Stewart.
Please follow me," and so saying, the officer turned on his heel, Sloan following in close pursuit.
The plane, with Sloan aboard, landed in England the following day.
