Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer. '}];

"You didn't bring me to the war, I brought myself.
You must get out of here before they kill you," he said in a panic.
"Too late," she said.
Thelton's dark eyes widened.
"They killed you?"
he asked in disbelief.
"Does that mean they killed me too?"
Thelton could feel the pain slowly slip away.
With each minute that passed, he felt more and more relief.
"No, neither one of us dead.
What I meant was; I got hit with arrow."
"Where at?"
Thelton asked with concern.
The fire moved about their bodies in a rhythmic motion.
"In thigh."
Indy pointed at her thigh.
"Are you alright?"
"I am now."
"Good," he said.
There was silence for a moment.
More of his pain slipped away.
"I can't figure out where we are at or what is going on here."
Because he had lost so much blood, Thelton had lost sense with reality.
"We are at Firelake," Indy said.
"Firelake?
Firelake?"
He felt like he should know the word, but the idea of it still baffled him.
"You know what Firelake is?"
she said.
Thelton searched his brain until he found recollection.
Firelake!
Of course.
She had brought him here to save his life.
"Oh yeah!"
he said.
He remembered his mom.
Had she been real or had she been a dream.
He wondered if he was really at Firelake or if it was only a dream.
Indy closed her eyes and let the tranquility take her away.
"How did you know to rescue me?"
Thelton asked as he found more strength return.
"Your men called it destiny.
I don't know what means that.
I was with family and I missed you.
I wondered if you won war.
I decided to check.
I went to castle and found a battle going on.
There was killing everywhere.
I didn't like it and went to leave.
A man said he knew me.
He said he came over on the ship with us and saw you and I together.
He asked me if I wanted you.
I said yes.
Then we went looking for you.
He asked lots of men, until they finally helped me find you.
"When I reached you, you were on ground like you were dead.
I was scared.
I have seen dead before, and you looked it.
The men were wrapping material around your wounds.
Oh, they removed a few arrows too.
You screamed, and I knew you weren't dead.
They did lots of things to you.
Then someone asked me if I could fly.
I said yes.
They told me fly you to Firelake.
So I did, and here we are."
Thelton looked at Indy with much appreciation.
She had saved his life.
He smiled at the thought, then frowned "Did I want my life to be saved?"
he remembered how it felt to be with his mom.
"Indy should have let me die.
There is nothing in the lands compared to being with my mom.
Why hadn't Indy let me be?
If she hadn't interfered, I would be at peace, away from all the pain and hate."
At the moment, Thelton had conflicting feelings for Indy.
He was appreciative she saved his life, and he was angry she did.
He glared at her, but she didn't notice.
She had reclosed her eyes and had drifted into a better place.
Thelton hung to his anger as long as he could, but eventually the power of Firelake overcame his contention.
After several hours, the pain and anger was gone.
Thelton allowed himself to be completely consumed in peace and tranquility.
Chapter 26   Thelton and Indy spent three hours in the lake.
Their bodies had taken on rejuvenation and strength.
The only thing they had left to show for the war was the scars.
When they had finished healing, Indy flew them to the dragon camp.
It was strange for Thelton to return there.
He had been there two times before.
The first time he had entered the camp, he had come with the mission to kill Indy's mom, the queen dragon.
He would have too, if it hadn't been for Indy.
She had stopped him a split second before he had killed the queen.
The second time he had gone to the camp was to steal Indy away from Sterling.
He had felt so powerful at the time, sweeping in and taking her.
Now he was back at the camp.
As soon as Indy released Thelton from their flight, several of the male dragons came sniffing over to him.
She could see the hunger in their eyes.
Thelton could sense it as well.
Nervous, he quickly reached for his swords to attack, but they were gone.
"Imara, I don't think this is a good idea," he said using the name he had given Indy, swinging a stick in front of him.
He remembered how the dragons had chased after him.
Indy crouched down into fighting position between Thelton and the dragons while she spread her wings open to full span.
She growled and hissed as she paced back and forth in front of Thelton.
The dragons kept their distance, but they continued to circle around the two of them.
One of the dragons stepped too close, and Indy launched her long claws into his face.
She ripped away a flap of skin.
Although the dragon could have easily taken her, he stepped back, for she was family.
This display went on for a while, until slowly, each dragon walked away and went to another side of the camp.
Sweat poured down Indy's face and stung her eyes.
When all the dragons had retreated, she sat down, panting.
Thelton slid next to her, but he didn't let up his guard.
He held tightly to his stick.
Indy looked at Thelton and saw the color hadn't returned to his face.
"You were scared," she mocked.
She had rarely seen Thelton scared.
"No I wasn't, I could handle myself.
Don't forget, they call me the Dragon Slayer."
Indy's face turned sour.
"Don't you dare kill any of my family."
He remembered how sensitive she became when he had killed a dragon in front of her.
Thelton felt stupid for using his title in front of her.
Of course she wouldn't want to hear about all the dragons he had killed.
Having nothing else to say, they sat back to back, supporting each other in silence.
When night came, they went up into the tree house Sterling had built for Indy.
"Did you love him?"
Thelton asked as he examined the craftsmanship of the tree house.
He was very impressed by the quality of the work.
Sterling built it without any real tools.
He had done an impressive job.
"Did I love who?"
Indy asked.
"Did you love Sterling?"
Thelton asked as he spit out Sterling's name.
Thelton was playing games with her, and she didn't like it.
Of course she loved Sterling, just like she loved Thelton.
She decided to throw the game back at him.
"Did you love her?"
she asked, in reference to Princess Alashia.
Thelton got the hint, and let the subject go.
The two cuddled against each other for warmth and went to sleep.
Thelton slept all through the night and into the early morning.
It had been a long time since he had gotten such a good deep sleep.
When he woke up, he laid in the tree house, listening to the sounds of the Vegus Forest all around him.
Indy was gone.
Still tired, he drifted back to sleep.
When he awoke again, he could smell the savor of roasting meat.
It kind of smelt good, and horrifically stunk at the same time.
As he stretched, his joints creaked.
When he felt good and limber, he jumped out of the tree house and joined Indy by a fire she had built.
In the middle of the fire was a roasting troll.
Indy had learned from Thelton and Sterling how to roast an animal.
She could eat meat raw, and actually preferred it that way, but she had learned men liked to eat things cooked.
