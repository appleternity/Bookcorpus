CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Munster asks, and Johnny snorts.
"Am I a what?
A fucking doctor?
Witch doctor, more like, but it's the best you got."
He walks over and roughly pushes Munster down onto the bed.
"Oi!
Careful!"
Munster starts, but Johnny ignores him.
"Hey, I'm just popping out!"
Mara says brightly.
"You need anything?"
"Mara...?"
Munster manages to say, before Johnny grabs his face and forces his mouth open with his hands, but Mara is already gone.
Johnny is feeling under Munster's chin and it hurts, but the guy looks so angry, Munster really doesn't want to say anything, until Johnny starts pressing into his neck, wrapping his hands around it and squeezing gently, then a little more tightly, until Munster has to squeal before Johnny lets go.
"Can't take the heat?"
Johnny smirks as Munster gasps for breath and tries to steady himself.
"Wh... what are you doing?"
Munster asks.
Johnny pulls himself back and laughs.
"Nothing.
I ain't got a clue about this, me.
But Mara asked me to take you to see someone.
Can you walk?"
"Erm... well, no, that's the problem..."
Johnny puts his hand in his mouth as if thinking.
"I'll put you in the cart.
We use it for the bar.
Cover you like you're meat, or summat.
I'll take you down that way.
No use in drawing attention to ourselves, is there?"
Johnny reaches over, and for a moment Munster thinks he's going to strangle him again, but instead he lifts him up an onto his shoulder, surprisingly easily for such a skinny looking guy.
"Ouch!"
Munster cries.
"Shut up" Johnny says and, reaching behind, tries to smack him on the face.
"Hey!
Come on!
I thought you were trying to help me!"
Munster tries, but Johnny just snarls at him and walks through the door of the room, jerking upwards at the last minute to make sure Munster's head strikes the frame.
"What the hell's the matter with you?"
Munster asks.
"Let me go!"
There's a laugh from Johnny.
"You sure you want me to do that, pal?"
and he kneels down.
"Hop off then" he starts, then "Oh, sorry, you can't.
What a shame.
Then shut the fuck up."
Johnny gets back up and walks down a dark, damp corridor, small shafts of light getting through breaks in the wall where bricks should have been.
It stinks in here, too, like some animal had been left to rot, and Munster tries not to gag, not wanting to risk Johnny's further rage by throwing up all over his back, but it's hard.
They get to a door which Johnny kicks open, and which leads out into a small yard, which, Munster guesses, must be at the back of the house they've been in, the one next to the bar.
As Johnny said, there's an old, hand pushed cart there, and Johnny unceremoniously throws Munster into it, landing his face in something soft and squidgy, that Munster really doesn't want to think about.
Munster turns himself round and wipes his face down, and looks back at Johnny, who's standing over the cart.
"Right" Johnny says, "you keep fucking quiet you understand.
Don't want anyone nosing in here, do we?
They don't take kindly to cripples."
"Where are we going?"
Munster ventures.
"Like I told you" Johnny says gruffly, "I'm taking you to see a doctor.
I'd have let you rot, but Mara, she asked us, so I guess I have to."
He reaches over to something beside Munster and pulls it up; it looks like some sort of cover, which Johnny starts to fold out.
"Where is Mara?"
Johnny looks up.
"Good, was she?"
"What?"
"In bed.
Was she good?
Made you come?"
"Erm..."
"She likes a bit of the rough stuff, Mara does.
Bet you enjoyed that, didn't you?
Bet you enjoyed taking advantage of her."
"What?
No!
It was her...
I mean, you know, I'm sorry..."
Munster finds himself saying, without quite realising why he's apologising.
"Yeah, well" Johnny sniffs.
"Maybe if you hadn't been so fucking lecherous, you may not be in this mess" and he throws the cover over the cart, shielding Munster from view and from the constant rain.
The cart jerks upwards and starts to trundle forward across the rough ground, the vibrations knocking him around and sending judders of pain into his body.
He tries to hold on to the sides of the cart to reduce the pain, but it doesn't help much, and also means that he can't cover his face, and so is exposed to the smell here, which is almost worse than it was in the house.
Munster feels the nausea returning and taking over his body and it's all he can do to stop himself from throwing up.
If he had any choice he would start kicking and shouting until the cart stopped and Johnny let him go, but what can he do?
It's not like he can go to a doctor and get treatment, it's not like he has any money to do that, even if he could get hold of one... so then what else can he do?
He's completely useless and there's no way Louise wouldn't kick him out, and then what?
Left to rot on the streets to beg for mercy or until the dogs get him.
So he hangs on, trying to think of anything to distract him from this, and when that doesn't prove enough, he lets his left hand go from the side of the cart and starts to dig his fingernails into his left cheek, scratching hard to make it painful.
He just feels the wetness of blood when the card judders to a halt, and he lets his breath out in relief, unaware that he had been holding it.
The smell engulfs him and suddenly his stomach lurches and he can't control himself any longer, the stench and the pain overwhelming him as the contents of his guts are retched up and onto his body, still only covered loosely with the torn dressing gown.
Oh god oh god oh god, Johnny's going to kill me, and he starts, as best he can, in the dark, trying to mop up the sick with the dressing gown, with something that felt like a rag, before Johnny pulled back the covers.
Suddenly the cart jerks and starts moving again, to Munster's relief, giving him a bit more time; at least his stomach is a bit more settled even though the smell is immeasurably worse.
It stops again and this time there's Johnny's voice, shouting something, then there's a crash and then there's another voice, and then the cart jerks forward a few more yards and stops again, before another crash.
More voices and suddenly the cover is yanked off and Munster finds himself again under the wet sky, blinking to get used to the light.
There are two figures standing there, but he can't yet make out who they are.
"Jesus!
The fucker's thrown up" says the one on the left, Johnny, he's sure, from the voice.
There's a snort.
"Not my problem.
Get him cleaned up before you bring him inside" and the figure steps away and disappears.
Johnny leans forward and grabs Munster's arms, keeping as far away from him as possible.
"I'll make you pay for this" he mutters, "now I'm going to have to clean the cart up, aren't I."
He pulls Munster roughly out into the open and lets him fall to the ground, and then kicks him, hard, in the side.
Munster grimaces and cries out.
"Sorry" he gasps, "I couldn't help it."
"Pull yourself up or crawl after me.
I ain't going to carry you after that."
Johnny spits on the ground next to Munster, and Munster looks up at him.
"Please" he whispers, but all this does is earn him another kick and push him further into the mud on the ground.
Clutching his side, Munster turns back up, and, trying to avoid Johnny, grabs the lower axle of the cart's wheel and pulls himself up.
The pain in his side is killing now, it feels like he's bleeding inside, but he tries to put this out of his mind as he concentrates on keeping his weight on his arms and leveraging himself to a half standing position against the crate.
He avoids putting any weight on his legs, sitting on the edge of the cart, getting his breath back, before trying to move any further.
He looks up, careful to avoid Johnny's gaze, careful not to antagonise him further, to see himself in another yard, this time gated and protected from the main street, behind another brick building, run down and derelict looking, with a corrugated iron sheet covering what must be the doorway.
"Are we here?"
he asks, tentatively.
Johnny smiles cruelly and says "Yeah, we're here.
Welcome to the doctor's abode" and moves his hand quickly, making Munster cower back and cover his head with his hand in anticipation of a blow.
But Johnny's holding his hand out.
"Grab hold.
I'll help you walk" and gratefully Munster takes hold of Johnny's hand, only to find himself jerked forward and let go as Johnny laughs.
Munster spins dangerously on his feet, but suddenly he's finding that they don't crumple, and he's still upright.
"Oh!"
he cries.
"Oh!
They're better" and relief floods through him as he turns to Johnny.
"I can stand!"
he shouts happily.
"Fuck" Johnny says, and punches him in the face.
-------- Munster's got over all the weird shit of waking up and trying to work out where he is.
He's got over the fact that he doesn't recognise his surroundings, that he's in what seems to be a warehouse, old and seemingly abandoned except for the unusual fact that it's actually lit with artificial light and not candles ... which means money, but also means fear.
He's got over the fact that his head hurts, not really surprising given that Johnny seems to have punched him, and that his nose really hurts, which could mean it's broken.
He can taste dried blood in his mouth - probably from his nose, but he can't do anything about it, because he appears to be tied up, his hands held tightly behind his back and attached to a large metal pipe that also pulls him in and makes his back sore.
He's struggling to get over the fact that things are clearly not what he expected and that he's probably in a huge amount of trouble.
On the plus side, he's standing, which means that his legs are still working.
On the minus side, he is tied up.
And in a scary looking warehouse where people can afford to leave the lights on with just him in it, even scarier than having artificial light to begin with.
Apart from the general abandonment and dark, dusty corners, from which strange noises can be heard, apart from all that, there are two stools just in front of him, waiting, empty, for people to come and sit on them.
But for the moment it's just him.
Until there's a clank, and a bang, and then a shaft of grey daylight that opens up in front of him, behind the stools.
Daylight and they leave the lights on.
These are serious people.
Two figures step in; the first, Munster recognises as the young and fit form of Johnny, with his permanent scowl; the second, an older, skinny man, wearing a long, dirty white coat, his tall frame marked by what seems to be a permanent stoop.
They are talking quietly as they approach Munster, without looking at him, and Munster decides it's probably best to keep quiet.
They stand by the stools, without bothering to sit down, still talking, but in such quiet voices that Munster can't make out the words even though they are only a couple of feet away from him, until, eventually, the old man glances in Munster's direction, a surprised look crossing his face.
His face is old and lined, but not without compassion, accentuated by the half-heartedly shaven grey stubble.
"Ah!"
he says, his voice croaky, "our patient is awake!"
Johnny throws Munster a glance and sighs, as if Munster has done him a major disservice by waking up from the punch.
"Munster" he grunts, "this is Dr Partington."
Dr Partington steps forward and smiles.
"Delighted to make your acquaintance!"
he says, putting out his hand, but Munster just stares at it and eventually the doctor realises his mistake and laughs.
