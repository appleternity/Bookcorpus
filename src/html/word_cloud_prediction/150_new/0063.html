CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

"I'm no monster," he said, watching as whatever worries she was dwelling on clouded her eyes.
"I'm just trying to help, that's all."
"Well, you're not."
It was only when he was running water at the sink and the first stirring of his wolf caught his attention before he realised the time.
Tonight was the first full moon of the cycle, the time when all wolves were slave to the magnetic call that compelled them to phase.
"It's a full moon," he said, turning to where she continued to sit in silence.
There was no way he was letting her out of his house to run free in the forest.
She returned a blank look.
"I can't allow you to run, sorry."
"Oh.
Um, sure, that's okay," she replied, getting to her feet.
"I'll be fine."
Taylor lifted the pepper grinder off the table and held it up to him.
"Where does this go?"
"I can give you something to help you sleep if that would ease it for you?"
he offered.
"No, there's no need."
"Taylor, you--."
"I'll manage," she insisted.
"Could you please tell me where this goes?"
Her reaction was baffling as she gave up waiting for an answer and set the grinder on the counter.
Shifting during the full moon was as necessary as breathing.
How was she not troubled by knowing her wolf would have to be subdued?
No Lycan could  ignore the call of  ...
Dean stared at where she stood with her back to him, now looking for a home for the butter dish.
"Taylor," he said softly.
"Can you not ... ?"
Her shoulders tensed.
"Where does the butter go?"
"Taylor."
The dish came down on the counter with a hard crack.
"Leave it," she warned.
"Are you telling me you can't phase?"
"I said leave it."
"You can't phase?"
With her back still turned, she shoved her hands into the pockets of her hoodie.
"You can't take no for an answer, can you?"
"Are you serious?"
Dean threw the tea-towel onto the counter and took a step towards her.
"You can't phase?"
"No."
"How is that possible?"
"It just is."
"It just is?"
he repeated.
"You're telling me you can't phase and that's your explanation?"
"You don't need to know why I can't phase."
"I beg to differ," he said, taking her arm to make her face him.
"It's none of your business!"
she snapped, wrenching her arm free.
Taylor rammed one shoulder against him, but he blocked her path.
"It is my business, and not because I'm an Alpha, but because I'm a werewolf.
Who did this to you?"
"Let it go," she ground out.
"I've no problem being stuck here while you run.
I'll be fine, really."
"How long have you been like this?"
Muttering at his persistence she moved to push by him again, but he slammed a hand against the edge of the counter, trapping her in place.
"How long have you been like this?"
"What does it matter?
It's my problem, not yours!"
"Why can't you just give me one damned answer?
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?"
"Hey!"
she yelled.
"Why don't you do yourself a favour and get this into your thick skull.
You.
Cannot.
Help.
Me."
Again, she shoved against him, but it didn't budge him an inch.
It was alarming how weak she was.
"You shouldn't be able to speak to me like that," he said.
"Your wolf shouldn't allow it."
"Well, she's not around to nip my butt, so I'll speak to you whatever way I like."
"What do you mean she's not around?"
"She's taken a forced leave of absence."
"What?"
"Yeah, she's gone.
Been involuntarily removed."
"Your wolf is gone?"
Realising how frustration had made her blab, Taylor once again ground her together and folded her arms.
Tears glistened in the corners of her eyes and the sight stirred pain in Dean.
"Your wolf is gone?"
he repeated.
"Taylor ..."
Her watering eyes slid from his to drift to a point beyond his shoulder.
"I don't understand."
It wasn't possible.
Lycans don't lose their wolves.
They don't just up and leave.
"Your wolf is gone?"
he repeated.
"Stop saying it," she muttered.
"But, how?
And for how long?
Days, weeks?"
Dean grabbed her shoulders, wanting to shake an answer loose, but she shrugged his hands away and attempted to push him aside again.
"Stop with all the questions!"
she pleaded, elbowing him when he refused to move.
"Taylor."
"No!
Leave me alone.
I'm not telling you anything else!"
"You're giving me no choice but to find out who your pack is," he snapped, no effort required in keeping her trapped between him and the counter.
"If you don't answer my questions, I'll have no other option."
In that second he was sorely tempted to follow through on his warning.
It would only take minutes to run upstairs to his office, pick up the phone and dial the first Alpha on his list.
Her pathetic attempts to squirm away came to an abrupt stop.
"If you contact my Alpha," she stilled, her voice lowering to deliver her threat, "I'll harm one of your pack."
"And you know exactly what that would force me to do."
"Yes, I do."
Dean paused in disbelief as she stared up at him with determination.
"You'd rather die?"
"If that's what it takes for you to butt out, then yes."
This time, when she pushed by him, he let her go.
Chapter 15
Dean scrubbed his hands across his face, exhaled a build-up of frustration and sank back in his office chair.
"Okay," he said to the screen of his laptop, lacing his hands behind his head, "let's have a think about this."
Taylor is a rogue he began, ordering his thoughts before making any further moves, a rogue, who for some really screwed up reason has lost, or can't connect with her wolf.
Whatever did this to her originated from her pack and she's terrified of them finding her.
"Yep," he sighed.
"That's about it."
And that was all he had learned.
The phone on his desk waited, but his hands stayed put behind his head.
He'd met rogues before, dealt with them in all kinds of situations, but this was the first time he'd ever seen a rogue so terrified of being returned to their pack they would choose to die first.
Her threat of harming one of his pack was an empty one, she didn't have the necessary strength, but her determined words had finally sunk in with him.
Taylor's need to leave his territory, as far as she was concerned, was for her own survival.
It had taken a few moments before he'd been able to shake his head clear of Taylor's alarming revelations and follow her out of the kitchen.
She'd found the living room and had curled up in a tight ball on the corner of his couch, her refusal to make eye contact lasting for nearly half an hour, along with her silence.
Not that he'd asked her more questions, he'd decided to drop the interrogation because it had been making him uncomfortable to see how distressed she was becoming, but every suggestion of how he could help were met with ardent head shakes until the moment when he'd offered her a place in his pack.
Then she had finally spoken.
"No."
"Taylor, come on, think about it.
If you join my pack you'd be under our protection."
"I said no."
"Even temporarily?"
"No."
"Why?"
"It would only make things worse."
"How?
That makes no sense."
Her reply had been a bitter laugh, then silence again.
In the end, more frustrated than he'd thought possible, he decided to show her the guest bedroom so she could enjoy her own mute company.
She'd refused of course, insisting that sleeping on the couch would suit her better, and he'd just been about to remind her of how the house was securely guarded and there was no way she'd be able to sneak out during the night, when she had looked up and pleaded with him for one final time that he not contact her pack.
About to shrug a reply to his genuine indecision, her cowered form in the corner of his couch registered.
This wolf was maimed, maimed in a way he would never have thought possible, and he couldn't pretend to ignore it any longer.
Lycans were violently territorial and unfailingly savage about protecting their own packs, but an honour code still existed beneath the aggressive covetousness, a code that compelled them to defend any of their kin when threatened by another kind.
As an Alpha, this rogue was his responsibility, but as a werewolf, this injured female was his responsibility too.
"I won't contact your pack," he had decided aloud.
