LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.' 'Unless you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.'

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

"You knew we lived in the same city?"
He nodded.
"When I got back on Sunday, I contacted Admissions and asked whether a Mrs Ashmore had been admitted with a heart attack.
And lo and behold, she had.
I was down in the Cath Lab on Friday and just happened to notice she was on the list for an angiogram today.
I've always got a mountain of paperwork to get through anyway, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to be around, just in case.
Besides, the guy who's covering for me this week, well."
He grimaced.
"He's an okay enough surgeon, but..."
Luke the perfectionist.
I gazed at him, my mouth suddenly going very dry.
He'd done all that for me.
"It really wasn't a coincidence, was it?"
He shook his head.
"Nope."
"So when you came up to talk to us after the operation--you knew you were going to see me?"
He grinned.
"Well, there was always the chance it was a completely different Mrs Ashmore, I guess.
But yes, that was the plan."
"And there was I--" "--all wrapped up in Daniel's arms."
He grimaced.
"Seeing that was bad enough, but when I realised your Daniel was that Daniel..."
I stared at him, my sense of euphoria dissipating.
"Chloe," I faltered.
He nodded slowly, his gaze remaining steady on mine.
"I know.
There are things we need to talk about.
But not here."
And letting me go he dropped his hand into mine, tugging me into motion.
"Come on.
Let's get you home."
Chapter 8 I awoke with a start, uncomfortably warm, the bedclothes stifling, wrapped far too tightly around me.
Judging by the darkness, it was still very early.
In fact, somehow the room appeared a little too dark.
Puzzled, I lifted my head and shoulders from the bed to look towards the window, wondering whether there'd been a power cut and the street lamps were out.
But to my astonishment I couldn't see the window.
I couldn't see a thing.
"Fuck!"
I gasped, sitting bolt upright and waving my hand in front of my face.
"What the fuck?"
"S'okay," a male voice murmured sleepily.
"Lie down, babe.
Go back to--" I screamed, scrambling out of bed as fast as I could.
"Fuck!"
I yelped again as it occurred to me exactly whose voice it was, my heart thudding painfully in my chest.
"Oh God!"
"Good morning to you too."
Luke sounded both amused and apologetic.
"I should've known there wasn't a chance you'd sleep straight through."
"What?
Where am I?
Where are you?"
Hearing movement, I peered through the gloom, just about managing to make him out.
"Why the hell is it so dark in here?"
"You're at my place, in my bed.
Well, you were in my bed.
And it's the middle of the night, why do you think it's dark?
" He patted the duvet.
"Come on Becks, get in again.
Let me cuddle you back off to sleep."
"Your place?"
Desperately trying to remember how I'd landed up there, I stared at him, suddenly realising the reason I was so warm was because I was still fully dressed, minus my shoes.
"Your bed?"
"You fell asleep while we were driving, just for a change.
What is it about my car?
And before you ask me why I didn't wake you up, I tried, okay?
Maybe not that hard, but you were out for the count.
You didn't even stir when I carried you up here."
"You carried me up here?"
"Are you just going to repeat everything I say?
Babe, you need to get some rest.
Back to bed, now."
I didn't move, the previous day's events streaming back to me like a clip show on fast forward.
The operation, the conversations I'd had with Sarah, with Daniel, with my mother.
With Luke.
"You're not going to do as you're told, are you?"
he said at last, sounding resigned.
I hesitated, playing for time.
"I need the loo."
"Of course you do."
He sighed.
"Okay.
Hang on."
I heard him fling back the duvet and then a click, the room suddenly flooding with low warm light.
I blinked hard, watching as he slid out of bed himself, rather relieved to see he was wearing a dark T-shirt and boxer shorts.
"Bathroom's just there," he said, pointing towards a door in the corner of the room.
"The light switch is on the wall outside."
"Thanks," I mumbled, already stumbling across the room.
And flipping on the switch I burst through the door, closing it behind me as fast as I could.
But when I turned around, I felt my jaw drop in astonishment.
"Wow."
The bathroom was as big as my bedroom at my mother's house.
Bigger, probably.
Alongside the toilet there was a huge white bathtub with gold-coloured fittings, on the other side a black-topped vanity unit with two gleaming white basins.
And to my right there was a walk in shower--good grief, a huge shower, big enough for a family of four to wash in all at once.
On closer inspection I saw not one but two showerheads and a ridiculously complicated-looking control panel.
But even more disconcertingly, as I took a few tentative steps forward I discovered I could see myself from every conceivable angle in the mirrors banding the walls.
Every surface glittered beneath the tiny spotlights in the ceiling, the wall tiles above and below the mirrors shining like highly polished marble.
"Becks?"
Luke called as I drew level with the bath.
"I've left you some towels and a toothbrush by the sink.
Help yourself to anything else you need.
There's a T-shirt there too if you want to get out of those clothes."
I hesitated, looking at the neat pile on the vanity unit.
"You know--maybe--maybe you should just take me home."
"Babe."
His sigh was clearly audible through the door.
"It's two in the morning.
I'm not taking you home.
And before you ask, I'm not calling you a cab either.
If it makes you more comfortable, I'll sleep on the couch and you can have the bed, okay?"
I bit my lip, knowing from his tone he wouldn't back down, not entirely sure I wanted him to.
"I'll sleep on the couch," I said at last.
"It's your bed."
"I don't think so."
There was a pause, a pause in which I could easily imagine the half-amused, half-irritated expression on Luke's face.
"I'll go and make us some hot chocolate."
"What?"
But there was no reply.
Trying to ignore my three hundred and sixty degree reflection, I used the loo then padded across to the vanity unit.
And after peeling off my clothes, I had a quick wash, burying my face in one of the wonderfully soft white towels when I'd finished.
"This is crazy," I whimpered, wondering whether I could stay locked in the bathroom for the rest of the night, knowing if Luke so much as kissed me, I'd be lost.
I wanted to be in his arms, in his bed.
I longed to feel his skin against mine, to feel him inside me, filling me in the way only Luke could fill me, thrusting slow and deep.
But I couldn't let that happen.
Not while there were questions that still needed answers, questions I was frightened to ask.
Questions I had no right to ask.
Sighing, I lowered the towel and studied myself in the mirror.
"Hey there, gorgeous," I muttered sarcastically, shaking my head at the sight of the dark rings beneath my eyes and my mussed-up hair.
But then Luke had never seen me looking exactly at my best, had he?
"Your hot chocolate's ready.
What the hell are you doing in there?"
I started at the sound of his voice then grimaced at my reflection.
"Nearly--nearly done," I called back, unfolding the T-shirt he'd left me and rolling my eyes at the logo emblazoned across the front.
Oxford University.
Well, of course he'd gone to Oxford.
When I finally emerged Luke was standing outside the bathroom door holding two steaming mugs.
"Nice," he murmured with a smile, eyeing me up and down, his gaze warmly appreciative.
"You look so much better in my clothes than I do."
I felt the colour flooding my cheeks, growing hotter still when he noticed my discomfort, his smile broadening.
He'd seen me naked more than once, yet somehow I felt way more exposed like this, his T-shirt barely reaching the tops of my thighs.
"Come on then."
He jerked his head towards the bed, already moving towards it.
"Come and try some of this chocolate.
It's my Granny's recipe.
I promise you'll never--" And then he stopped, seeming to realise I wasn't following.
After placing both mugs on the bedside cabinet he turned around, his smile waning.
"Okay, I get it.
I've got to sleep on the couch, haven't I?"
Not at all sure what to say, where to start, I stared back at him miserably, watching as his expression hardened.
