This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time)."}, {'frame': 'Connecting_architecture', 'tfidf': 1.757204294204712, 'lexical_unit': 'door.n / elevator.n / lift.n / escalator.n / corridor.n / hallway.n / window.n / staircase.n / stairs.n / step.n / gate.n', 'definition': "An entity is integrated into a building as a Part of a (possibly unexpressed) Whole which may refer to the whole building or merely to a sub-part of the building.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').

Chapter 5 Beautiful Stranger That Thursday was the longest day of my life.
Every single class seemed to last three hours, and even lunch with Lindy went painfully slow.
I barely tasted what I ate, though I did force myself to drink plenty of water.
I rushed back home and, before anyone else arrived, I claimed the bathroom for myself.
Just as I turned the blow dryer off, I heard the radio playing.
I stuck my head out of the door and saw Kathy and her boyfriend, or rather, her soon-to-be fiance, Will.
They sat close together on the sofa looking through a magazine, their heads almost touching.
I closed the door at once with a silent turn of the knob, in hopes they wouldn't notice me.
I applied my makeup using the most precision ever, making sure the black pencil lined my eyes straight and even, each eyelash sculpted into a perfect curve - long and thick, and finally, my lips carefully painted with the red lipstick, usually reserved for special nights out.
Next, to dress the rest of me: a bright shiny silver chain around my neck that matched my hoop earrings, and my favorite silver bracelet.
I pulled on my white cashmere sweater with a scoop neck line and a pair of brand new jeans.
I gave myself a once over in the mirror, loving how the sweater accentuated my hair; the effect of black on white - so dramatic.
By the time I left the bathroom, Kathy and Will had moved over to her bed.
They lounged on top of the covers, fully dressed, whispering quietly.
I tried to tiptoe out before they heard me, but the creaking floors gave me away.
Kathy turned at the noise, leapt up and bounced toward me extending her left hand.
Her excited giggle came out more like a squeal and she said, "Look, Lizzy!
I'm engaged!"
I took her hand and examined the ring.
After all the boasting and bragging, it made me happy to see that her man had finally come through with a ring.
"Wow!
It's beautiful.
Congratulations, guys!
Have you picked a date yet?"
I asked turning toward Will when I heard the bed squeak.
He planted his feet flat on the floor as he sat up on the side of the bed, rubbing his eyes.
"We're going to wait till Will graduates and he lands a job.
So, one year from next June - isn't that cool?
I am so excited!
I can't wait to go home and show my parents.
Will decided to give me the ring before my birthday, and we're driving over to see my folks this weekend.
It'll be the first time he meets them."
Kathy's excitement waned as she added in a much lower tone: "I hope they love him as much as I do."
When she glanced over at him, her eyes twinkled and she gave him a warm smile.
Will looked at the two of us huddled together by the closet door, raised an eyebrow, and said with a twinge of dread, "Yep, me too."
He was a man of few words.
In order to spend the rest of his life with Kathy, he'd have to stay that way.
Kathy, now moved by his concern, rushed back to the bed and sat beside him, lost in her own world, allowing me to finally make a break for it.
Although I didn't want any more long, drawn out conversation, I lingered for a moment in the open doorway, just watching the lovebirds.
She took his hand in hers and whispered words of encouragement.
He smiled.
Then they kissed.
It was a sweet scene, but I had far more pressing things to consider.
I closed the door behind me, quiet as a whisper, escaping without another thought of roommates and fiances.
I had only one thing on my mind as I left the building.
I practically skipped over to the pub, barely noticing the chill in the air.
It was earlier than when we had arrived the previous night.
The sky held huge gray clouds that glowed orange where the setting sun sat low in the sky.
My heart raced, though not out of fear or anxiety.
This time it was out of hopefulness.
I would simply die if he wasn't there.
I opened the door and was immediately blasted by loud music and the smell of fried foods - pizza and onions - all at once.
I stepped inside to laughter, clinking of glasses and silverware, and instant warmth.
As the door shut behind me, I glanced around, unbuttoned my coat, and fluffed out my hair, untangling it from the wind.
A few couples were already out on the dance floor, oblivious to me.
A man with curly brown hair sat at the bar, his head cranked in my direction, doing his best to get eye contact, but I refused and looked away.
I took my time, weaving through the tables toward the booth where he had sat the night before: it was empty.
I removed my coat and sat down exactly where he had been sitting when I first spotted him.
My thoughts lingered on that moment, centering on his long, black hair.
Not too unlike my own, I mused, smiling.
I had no idea if he would even be here again, but I had to find out who he was, why I felt so drawn to him - this stunning stranger.
This was so new and foreign to me, to be venturing out to a bar all alone, deliberately looking for someone - and with such determination.
But I was driven like never before: as though the winds of change had taken me by force and compelled me like a violent storm.
It was his eyes.
They had never really let me go; I was still haunted by those eyes - so dark, so penetratingly beautiful.
Even though we had not exchanged one word between us, I had to come back.
As I waited for the server to take my order, I checked my face in my pocket mirror:  eye makeup good, lipstick straight, nothing in my teeth.
I smoothed out my hair again and slid to the back of the booth for a better view of the whole room and the main entryway.
A minute or two later the door opened, letting in the sounds of the street just as a motorcycle roared by.
A young couple walked in hand-in-hand.
I let out the breath I had been holding.
Not him.
When the waiter came I ordered a salad and a glass of iced tea.
I wasn't the least bit hungry.
I was far too nervous and excited to think of food.
The door swung open again, and two loud, obnoxious guys came in: one with short, dark hair; the other blonde.
Their whooping and hollering was enough to set my teeth on edge.
As if that wasn't bad enough, when they spotted me, one elbowed the other as they sauntered toward the bar and made annoying wolf noises.
What jerks!
Thankfully, my server came and blocked their view of me.
I picked at my salad for about ten minutes.
I didn't want to have green things in my teeth when I smiled, so I basically pushed things around with my fork, ate a few croutons, and sipped my tea.
A dismal heaviness crept over me when the streetlights came on - still no sign of him.
I began to wish I had just stayed home and finished my school work.
The two loud men looked my way and the blonde one stood up as though he planned to come toward my table.
I snatched up my purse and headed in the opposite direction to the ladies' room, my hair swishing behind me.
I spent more time than necessary in there in the hopes that Blondie would take the hint and leave me alone.
Finally, I sneaked back to my table, but kept my eyes on the floor.
I didn't want to give those guys the wrong impression by any stray eye contact.
Edging my way back, I inhaled a remarkable fragrance that I hadn't noticed earlier - a cross between something sweet and musky with a hint of spicy smoke.
Someone must have just blown out a candle or two.
I sat back down, adjusting myself as I slid in, and risked a quick glance toward the bar for my potential stalkers: they were on the other side of the dance floor, shooting pool.
Success!
I picked up my fork and attempted to stab a tomato - which promptly flew up into the air, bounced once on the table and then took flight out onto the floor!
I felt my face burn as red as my flying tomato.
Flaming hell - how embarrassing!
I was glad the lights were dim, and nothing but faint candle flame flickered through the room casting irregular shadows at each table.
I glanced around furtively to see if anyone had noticed my acrobatic food display - and there - right at the booth next to mine, facing straight toward me, looking deep into my eyes, sat the man with the long black hair and unfathomable eyes.
My heart pounded hard and wild within my chest, taking my breath away.
My memory eluded me, my mind now completely blank.
I blinked, trying to catch my breath and gather my thoughts together, feeling dazed and quite stupid.
What the hell had I planned to do once I found him?
The corners of his mouth turned up a little.
Smile!
I had planned to smile!
And so I did.
He returned the smile more fully, and our eyes locked.
I wanted to look around so I could get a full view of him, but it hardly mattered any more.
He was here!
And I could behold those wonderful, dark eyes again, though it felt more like he was beholding me; they bore into me so deeply.
I wondered how long we would keep this up: smiling and staring.
I blinked again, picked up my glass, and took a sip of tea.
For one second, I glanced away as I reached for my napkin.
When I looked back he had moved and now stood right beside my table.
Not wanting to miss a thing, I took my time studying him, directing my view upwards - slow and easy.
He wore black pants and a black shirt, and when he removed his dark, blood-red scarf, I noticed a silver chain with some sort of medallion.
There was a tattoo on the side of his neck, but from where I sat, I couldn't tell what it was.
His ebony hair fell down past his shoulders, straight and silky.
He had a strong, square chin with a smoky 5 o'clock shadow coming down along his jaw-line and surrounding his smooth, hard-candy lips; his nose was straight and narrow like a Greek sculpture, and his eyes - my God, his eyes!
They were so dark now that they were purple.
Once again he peered far into me, holding me firmly in place, captivating me by his determination, fascinating me with his stunning, good looks.
The way he gazed at me with purpose and intent told me there wasn't a thing I could hide from him - ever.
I cleared my throat, trying to find my voice.
"Please, sit down."
Did I just say that out loud?
I must have: he nodded and eased himself in across from me.
I was able to see his eyes straight on now.
It was nearly impossible to speak, to breathe, or to look away.
I supposed we could spend the whole evening staring; I could live with that.
Raising an eyebrow, I pushed my hair back behind my shoulder, wondering if he would ever speak.
"Your hair is lovely," he said, as if he had read my mind.
His voice was velvety-deep, strong and sincere.
"Your hair is..."
I groped for the correct word.
What should I say?
Lovely in a handsome way?
It was the length that made it so arresting, so beautiful.
"Long," he said, finishing my sentence for me.
"Right, but that's not what I meant.
What I mean is, I don't think you should ever cut it... it becomes you.
It belongs where it is, not on some barber's floor."
My mouth had gotten ahead of my brain.
I wasn't trying to be funny and hoped I wasn't blabbering like an idiot.
"No worries," he said with a brief smile.
It was then that I noticed his British accent and asked, "Are you from England?"
"Yes.
I am here on holiday."
His voice was as alluring as his eyes and his hair.
How insane is this?
My mind reeled.
