This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

She'd had them for more than five years, had them resoled once, and they were in excellent condition.
It was already hot, promising a scorcher, and she tucked her mass of hair into a ponytail and then clipped it atop her head to leave her neck bare.
She squinted, reminding herself to dig out her sunglasses later today, as well as her sunblock.
She now followed a very zombie-like LeAnn back to the mess hall.
If dinner had been delicious, breakfast was divine, with bacon Kristin knew had been cured right here on the farm, eggs fresh from the chicken coops, and raw cream for the coffee.
She refrained from giving the details of freshness to LeAnn, who perked up as she shoved the 'fat pig and cow' into her mouth, knowing she'd likely freak out that none of it was processed, labeled, and purchased from a supermarket.
As the group finished up, Dale appeared from what she assumed was the kitchen, wearing a dark green T-shirt that made his eyes look supernatural.
Kristin's breath caught in her throat, and she heard LeAnn's low whistle of approval just before he clapped his hands to get everyone's attention.
Kristin forced herself not to look away as his eyes landed on her.
Dale turned away, ready to address the group, but she had the sensation he was still looking at her from the corner of his eye.
"Okay, folks, today's adventure begins with a little education.
We're going to head to the stables in a few minutes.
You're going to learn how to properly saddle and bridle a horse, and then we're gonna get you all on a horse.
Can I get a show of hands for anyone who's never been on horseback?"
Kristin looked around the room and groaned inwardly as several hands shot up and several more came up slowly, as if the admission embarrassed them.
LeAnn was one of those.
Kristin blinked at her and leaned over to whisper, "You've never been on a horse?"
LeAnn's eyes glittered with excitement.
"No, and I can't wait!"
"Excellent," Dale continued, stifling the quiet muttering.
"Half and half is perfect.
We'll split into two groups after we saddle up.
One group will go with Bobby and learn the basics of riding a horse, using the reins, and sitting comfortably before you head down the trail.
The other half will come with me, and we'll take the experienced trail."
Was it Kristin's imagination, or did he look straight at her as he said that?
It brought back an unbidden memory of being with him on her parents' ranch, taking Maximus and Primus, two of her Appaloosas, for a ride out into the woods.
While there, they'd stopped and had what had perhaps been the most epic make out session of her life.
Something low in her belly heated, and she had to swallow a sudden twinge of longing.
She hadn't felt that kind of desire in so long it was foreign, and it frightened her.
"When we get back from our rides," Dale continued, cutting into her thoughts, "we'll go through how to clean and brush a horse, how to clean the tack, and how it's stored.
By that time, you're all going to be pretty hungry.
With the horses in their stalls, Wesley will have the barbecue ready to go in the large corral, and we'll get our grub on and talk about the evening."
Kristin could almost feel the protest that went around the room.
While she didn't necessarily think the majority of the guests were lazy, she knew for a fact they didn't understand just how much work went into running a ranch.
They were ready to complain about a couple of lessons in caring for a single horse, when in actuality, there were usually no more than two trainers and anywhere from five to twenty horses in their charge.
Personally, this assignment was a blessing, and Kristin welcomed the task.
Horses had been her passion and her main charge on her parents' ranch, and it was the one thing she missed in New York.
She would never complain about working with horses and only hoped Dale kept an Appaloosa or two in his stables, those being her biggest weakness.
*** Kristin mostly tuned out the lesson on saddling and bridling a horse.
It was old hat for her, and instead, she studied the group surrounding her, looking confused as they studied what Bobby and Dale were doing.
A few nodded, getting the picture, while some were bound to fall, not quite understanding the way a horse would push out its belly to keep the saddle from being properly tightened.
As each person was directed to a stall - Kristin counted somewhere around twenty-five stalls in just this stable and knew there was another one behind this - she stepped in front of a gorgeous white and gray Appaloosa named Rocky and fell instantly in love.
She offered her hand so he would get used to her scent, and he nuzzled it instantly, snorting and snuffling in greeting as he nodded his big head.
She smoothed her fingers over his long face, and her soul settled, as if Rocky ate her stress for breakfast.
"Hey, there, Rocky," she cooed softly, turning him side to side to inspect him more closely.
He had to be eighteen hands, at least.
"We're going to be best friends, right?"
LeAnn leaned over from the next stall, curious.
"Mine won't come to the front of the stall.
She's got her ass shoved into the back corner."
"I'll be right back, boy," Kristin told Rocky, patting his muzzle, and she scooted over next to LeAnn.
Sure enough, the dappled chocolate Hungarian Warmblood twisted its lips nervously and backed against the stall.
She glanced at the name on the stall - Bessie - and held out her hand, palm up.
"Hey, girl," she spoke softly.
"Come on, Bessie, come say hello."
To LeAnn, she muttered, "You can't be intimidated, or intimidating.
You have to be gentle, open, and firm, or one of two things will happen.
They'll fear you, or they'll think you're afraid and bully you."
She turned back to Bessie, who'd taken two hesitant steps forward.
"Come on, girl."
She motioned for LeAnn to hold out her palm in the same nonthreatening way, and slowly, Bessie made her way up to the front of the stall, sniffing them both and finally holding her head down for them to pet her.
"Now, remember, firm but gentle," Kristin said as she moved back to Rocky, who was watching her around the corner with giddy eyes.
"You're a damn horse whisperer, aren't you?"
LeAnn chuckled.
Kristin wouldn't claim that, but she'd always had a good handle with horses, felt naturally drawn to them.
She opened the door and led Rocky forward, taking the saddle Bobby had placed behind her on the saddle horse and making fast work of readying Rocky.
He behaved well, and she only had to wait a few seconds for him to breathe out so she could pull the belly strap tightly enough.
She heard LeAnn grunting and moved around Rocky to see what was wrong.
Putting her hand to her mouth to cover her laughter, she watched as LeAnn worked to tighten the strap, only to have it slide back and forth as she tugged.
"Wait for me, Rocky," she instructed, slapping his side hard and getting a quiet whinny in return.
She moved over and helped LeAnn, showing her how to hold the saddle and pull the belt strap at the same time.
When it was tight, LeAnn pulled away, and Kristin told her, "You're not done."
At her confused look, she grabbed LeAnn's hand, placed two of her fingers between the strap and Bessie's belly, and waited.
"It's perfect," LeAnn said, just before Bessie snorted and huffed.
Her belly shrank, and the strap loosened.
Kristin smiled and pulled the last few inches tight, leaving only room for LeAnn's two fingers.
"Oh."
"They do it every time."
Kristin reached for the bridle and coaxed Rocky's head down, getting it over his head and into his mouth with just a little extra force.
She led Rocky out of the stable, ready to go, and found herself tying him to the fence so she could help several other clueless guests with their saddles.
There simply weren't enough hands to go around, and she desperately wanted to get on the trail.
As the last few people struggled with the task, she was too irritated to continue and stepped out into the grass.
She put her foot in the stirrup and swung up on Rocky's back, the scent of him filling her nostrils and her body instantly becoming one with the horse's.
She didn't even mind as Dale rode up right next to her and stopped.
"What do you think of Rocky?"
he asked, reaching over to run a hand along the horse's mane.
"He's beautiful and well trained.
He didn't give me any grief.
It's unusual for his breed."
This was her comfort zone, and Kristin could ignore everything else that rested in the past between her and Dale, as long as they kept the conversation here.
"You know you're the one who gave me this idea, right?"
She stared at him in amazement, and that charming smile crept slowly over his face, making Kristin's heart stop again.
"I fell in love with your parents' ranch, and your horses changed my life.
Rocky's my fourth Appaloosa, and he's the first one that hasn't been a complete nightmare to train."
Kristin laughed.
"They're too smart.
That's the problem.
And they're arrogant and stubborn.
With most horses, it's a dominance thing.
With these babies, it's about love and respect," she said, running her hand down Rocky's neck.
She motioned to his shiny black Mustang.
"You like to live dangerously, I guess."
As if he knew what she'd said, the horse shook his head and snorted, pawing the ground defiantly with one hoof.
"Blaze is a good boy, really.
He just likes to surprise me every once in a while by breaking into a full gallop without me asking first."
Remembering that ride they'd taken, Kristin was shocked at his comfort level with the horses.
Of course, ranching had become his business, his livelihood, but she would never have expected Dale Prescott to become such a rugged cowboy...and to look so incredible in that position.
She closed her gaping mouth before she embarrassed herself by drooling.
She'd been honest with LeAnn; in high school, she'd found Dale insanely attractive, just as she did now.
But as an adult, and with a memory that brought everything back like it was yesterday, Kristin's urges were stronger.
She could guess at the body beneath the clothes, having seen the perfection of it once before and knowing that the years of hard work in the sun had likely only improved the tone and build of his muscles.
"Hey, Krissy, did you find what you were looking for in New York?"
The question was wistful, and it threw Kristin off balance, Rocky skittering slightly until she reined him back in and soothed him.
Trying to figure out how to answer, Kristin blinked at him several times.
"Well, I didn't really know what I wanted, other than to go to college.
I did that, and I landed a solid career that I adore, so I guess I did eventually find what I was looking for."
She hesitated.
"Are you finding what you want in life?"
He shrugged.
"I have the ranch, and that's fulfilling.
I've got friends and built-in family here."
His eyes clouded, and she was reminded of how the sky turned green before a tornado struck.
"I think I'm still searching for something, though."
He didn't say what, and the group of experienced riders had gathered around them, so she didn't ask.
Instead, she followed him out, with the rest of the group trailing behind as he took them into the woods behind the main house.
Chapter Seven Just Like Old Times It felt strange being separated from LeAnn, considering Kristin's best friend was the entire reason she was on this journey in the first place.
Being without her reminded Kristin too much of being on sabbatical, a quest for self-approval.
But she found she only had a few minutes to rest in her angst, Dale kicking up the conversation again about ten minutes into the trail.
"It looks like everyone in this group knows what they're doing," he mused, and Kristin glanced behind her, nodding in agreement.
While some of the riders were less comfortable in a saddle than others, everyone had obviously been on a horse before.
As she faced forward, Dale asked, "What is it you do in the Big Apple?"
Gritting her teeth against the urge to spew at the mouth about her disgruntling job loss, she thought back to LeAnn's word.
He'd never know the difference if she referenced the job as if she was returning to it in nine days.
"I work at a large marketing firm, with our clients ranging from shoe manufacturers to law firms.
In fact, I just finished a proposal for a huge account with a high-end retail clothing manufacturer that owns several brands."
"That's impressive," he responded sincerely.
"Was your intent to get into marketing?"
"I started out with journalism, but it wasn't creative enough for my taste.
So, I made that my minor and majored in marketing.
I discovered I had a knack for it, and I interned at my firm.
They hired me as soon as I had my degree."
Sadness swept through her as she realized she'd made herself at that company and was still being forced to start again.
"You grew up on a ranch, Krissy.
Don't you miss grass and trees and clean air?"
She laughed, the question relieving her inner pain.
"Spoken like a die-hard Texan.
And yes, sometimes the concrete jungle isn't enough.
But I'm happy.
If I'm craving greenery, there are parks.
I live blocks from Central Park, you know."
