The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

She needed help...
Amon slithered over to the fallen gun, picked it up, and inspected it curiously.
"I've never seen a gun like this before.
What is it called?"
"It's called," Hexa took a deep breath.
"Fuck you!"
Amon's eyes flashed with anger and he gave her a little shake.
"Tell me, female, or I'll crush all the bones in your legs!"
Hexa's eyes widened in fear at his threat.
She knew he'd follow through with it too.
"It's...a blaster.
Well, Jax called it a blaster - he made it."
"I see."
Amon crushed the gun into a ball in his bare hand and made sure that Hexa was watching him.
"No!"
Hexa cried out.
Amon removed the other gun from Hexa's holster next.
"And this one I remember...what was it called again?"
"A sonic shotgun," Hexa snapped.
"Another weapon far too dangerous to be left in the hands of the humans."
Amon crushed it to pieces next.
"No," Hexa murmured sadly as she watched the pieces of metal fall and hit the floor.
Her gray eyes teared up, but she wouldn't let her tears fall.
She'd failed...failed to avenge Jax.
And now she needed rescuing.
I'm so pathetic.
But even if I send an SOS no one would be able to get here in time to save me.
I'm so dead.
Unless that someone could teleport, a voice piped up in Hexa's mind.
That's right!
Malakye Sterling could teleport.
She hated asking him for help, but she had no choice.
As stealthily as she could Hexa got out her smart phone and began to text Malakye behind her back.
She needed to buy herself some more time...
"Amon, there's something that's been bothering me all this time.
Why didn't you kill me that day...you killed everyone else.
Did you leave me alive to suffer?"
Hexa questioned with a tremor to her voice.
Amon arched a brow at her.
"I didn't spare you.
By the time I was battling you I'd used up most of my venom on the others in your squad.
My venom killed them, and I injected what I could into your legs, but obviously it didn't kill you.
Somehow, you managed to survive and escape the temple without my noticing.
And your legs...were paralyzed as a consequence of having that much venom pumped into them apparently."
Hexa's eyes widened with this startling revelation.
All this time I thought Amon left me alive so that I could suffer over the loss of my brother.
But it was just an accident.
This meant that in a way her squad had truly protected her life with theirs.
Their sacrifice hadn't been in vain. Guys...Jax...thank you.
"And now I will rectify my mistake and kill you...slowly for your defiance, human female."
A sinister smile curled Amon's lips.
No!
Hexa mentally shouted.
Amon began to constrict his tail around her legs and Hexa let out a scream of terror.
She could feel her bones breaking!
At that moment, Malakye materialized inside of the restaurant and looked around.
He swiftly spotted Hexa in Amon's clutches.
"Hexa!"
He raised his hand and called out, "Time Stop!"
A blue stone pendant glowed brightly on Amon's chest, and nothing happened.
"What the hell?"
Malakye muttered darkly to himself as his brow furrowed in confusion.
Amon turned his golden gaze to Malakye.
"Did you just try to use your infamous 'Time Stop' on me?
Well, it's a good thing I decided to team up with the Lunarians.
Garnetta gave me this pendant yesterday at the club Iron Casket as a gift of thanks for my loyalty to their cause."
The demon fingered the pendant thoughtfully.
"So that's why you were there at the club yesterday," Hexa said through gritted teeth.
"You were forging an alliance with the Lunarians.
Dammit..."
"Amon, let Hexa go!"
Malakye demanded sternly.
He didn't like the sight of blood on Hexa's leg braces one bit.
"You're going to have to make me, Malakye Sterling," Amon challenged.
"Well, I plan to."
Malakye whipped out his wooden sword hilt and willed a blade of psychic energy to form.
He pointed his glowing blue sword at Amon threateningly.
Amon reached up and undid his turban to reveal his head of live, sandy-colored cobras before tossing his turban to the floor.
Malakye charged towards Amon, and the snake demon slithered across the floor towards the alien with incredible, superhuman speed.
Amon lowered his head and willed his cobras to attack Malakye simultaneously.
"Bite!"
Malakye dodged spitting cobras and swung his sword.
He ended up chopping off a few of the cobras' heads.
Amon let out a roar of outrage in response.
"How dare you...!"
The demon regretted that he didn't have his usual scimitar with him.
Amon let out a frustrated sound before tossing Hexa aside.
She went flying and hit the floor hard and rolled across it.
Hexa let out a yelp of pain.
"Hexa!"
Malakye called out in concern.
He turned to glare at Amon, his emerald green eyes flashing with rage.
"You bastard!"
He attacked again.
However, now that Amon had his tail free he began to put it to good use.
Amon sent his tail flying towards Malakye who was forced to jump up to avoid the deadly tail swipe.
Then Amon brought his tail up and then down, intending to simply smush Malakye like a pancake.
Malakye used all of his skill and reflexes to dodge out of the way.
Amon was fast.
And Malakye was quickly tiring.
The battle against Garnetta had taken a lot out of him and he hadn't had the time to soak up some moonlight.
This meant he was running low on psychic energy.
The wounds on his back had also barely had time to heal and he could feel the wounds opening up again.
Amon attacked Malakye with his snakes again and the alien sliced off another cobra head.
Amon snarled, and whipped his tail out at Malakye, finally managing to trip the plant alien.
Oh shit.
Malakye tried to scramble out of the way, but it was too late.
Amon coiled his tail around the alien's legs and began to drag him across the floor.
The tail began to coil around Malakye's torso and kept his arms pinned to his sides so that he was unable to use his sword.
Once Malakye was in front of Amon, the demon flipped the alien onto his back.
"And now you die, Malakye Sterling."
The demon reared up over Malakye, and his snakes hissed in Malakye's face in unison.
"No, Mal..."
Hexa murmured as she watched what was happening from her place on the floor.
The snakes reared and prepared to strike.
Suddenly, the door to the Chinese Food Restaurant was kicked in and Agent Darkhart strolled inside with an air of authority, his long black trench coat billowing out behind him.
"Well, what do we have here?"
Agent Darkhart started in his gravely voice as he took in the scene before him.
His eyes narrowed into slits.
"Let Malakye Sterling go, Demon Commander Amon."
At that moment several super soldiers began to pour into the restaurant.
Amon could sense these men were not fully human and so posed a threat.
"Fuck.
I don't like these odds."
Amon hissed in Malakye's face.
"You got lucky, boy."
The snake demon released the alien and shot off, slithering away in the direction of the kitchen.
"After him," Agent Darkhart directed his men with a wave of his hand.
"Yes, Sir!"
the soldiers yelled out before pursuing Amon, guns raised.
Malakye quickly got to his feet and made his way over to Hexa.
He crouched at her side and frowned when he saw the horrible state she was in.
She was fading in and out of consciousness due to the excruciating pain she was in.
Her legs...were a mess.
Malakye swooped Hexa up into his arms and cradled her against his chest.
Agent Darkhart approached them with swift strides.
Hexa struggled to open her eyes and glanced at Agent Darkhart.
"Agent Darkhart, you came to rescue me?
How did you even know where I was?"
A slight smirk formed on the agent's thin lips.
"I went to your room to speak with you and saw what was on your computer monitors.
I watched the footage of Amon at Iron Casket that you'd retrieved.
I then used your facial recognition software to track him down...and you."
He reached out and patted her arm.
"I'm glad we made it in time, Hexa."
Wonder flashed across Hexa's face.
"Aren't you angry with me?
I broke the rules?
Aren't you going to punish me?"
Agent Darkhart looked at Hexa's bloody legs and frowned.
