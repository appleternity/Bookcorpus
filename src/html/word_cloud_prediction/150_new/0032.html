In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability. (MET)' 'It says a lot that he did n't come back. INI (MET) '"}];

The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

And he's right.
I need him to find Lou.
"Where are we going?,"
I ask him.
"To Caesar's, of course."
"Makes sense."
"Lou didn't want to stay there.
He figured in a Hollywood hangout like Caesar's he'd run into every swinging dick he ever knew.
But that young dolly insisted.
She wasn't coming to Tijuana and stay at no dump, that's what she told him, and if he wanted to get his bugle blown tonight he'd damn well take her to a class place.
And there's only one of those in town.
When I found out where Lou was staying, I got myself a room there, too.
Might as well be comfortable."
The entrance to Caesar's is just around the corner.
Inside the big double doors there's a long tile floored arcade stretching back to a bronze-doored elevator.
We get some attention shuffling through, but Nick stays calm: "Just keep the legs moving and the mouth shut," he tells me.
We'll be there in a second."
We're coming up on the elevator now.
The operator, a reedy Mexican in a button front uniform, smiles his automatic smile and waves us in, but an elegantly bald gent in a grey suit blocks our progress.
"Mr.
Flanagan, Mr. Thorne, can I be of help?"
It's the owner, Caesar Cardini, a piece of European jetsam washed on these shores after the War.
He's the guy who first thought to mix raw eggs in salad.
It's disgusting if you ask me, but it made him rich and famous and he's learned to act that way.
Behind him there's a powerful looking Mexican hard case in a double breasted white suit, which is a good thing to wear if your packing heavy hardware.
I figure him for the house dick.
"Caesar, old buddy, how you doing?"
says Nick.
"Good to see you, Mr. Flanagan.
Going up to your room?"
"Sure enough.
Jake here got mugged.
I remember when Tijuana was a nice place.
Fellah could walk on the streets at night.
I'm going to give him a stiff drink.
He'll be alright."
"Perhaps I should send a doctor up," says Caesar in a tone which says he's going to do it whether we like it or not, and maybe the house dick into the bargain.
"Sure, Caesar, you do that.
You know my room number."
"Of course.
Take them to three," he says to the elevator operator.
"We'll be waiting," says Nick.
The next second, we're in the elevator.
When we get to three, a bell dings and door opens.
The operator has his back to us.
Nick's still holding me up with one hand, but with the other he takes my rod out of his pocket and plants it, butt first, into the back of the operator's head.
The Mex says madre something or other and slumps into the hall.
Nick and I step over him.
"We gotta take the stairs," Nick says.
The door to the stairs is at the end of the hall, but I'm not going to make it, so Nick picks me up, fireman's carry, pushes through the door and starts down the stairs toward the second floor.
"It'll take 'em a few minutes to find the guy, then they'll go to my room.
After that, all hell will break loose, but we should be done with our business by then" Luckily for Nick, who's breathing hard under my weight, the room we're going to is next to the stairwell.
It's a big door at the end of the hallway with a brass plaque.
I feel myself sliding off his shoulder and propped up, nose first, against the door.
I groan "Who's there?"
It's Lou's voice from inside.
"Open the door, Jake," Nick whispers to me.
"No key," I grunt, trying to think straight.
"Don't worry," Nick says.
I feel his arm reach around me and grab the knob.
"It's open."
He turns the knob, the door swings wide and Nick shoves me on through.
I stumble a couple of steps and head for the floor not far from where Lou Carnesi is standing in a shocked embrace with the bounteous Gloria.
They're mostly naked.
The girl's wearing white knee socks over patent leather pumps.
Lou's in tented-front boxer shorts.
He's shirtless, his chest thick and hairy with four long, scabbed over scratch marks running down his shoulder blade.
I watch the rest of it from the floor.
"Nick, baby, what took you so long."
This from the naked girl, who jumps back from Lou as if he's suddenly electrified, bounces across the bed and snuggles up to Nick.
That solves the problem of where Nick's information was coming from.
" I unlocked the door when he was in the bathroom.
He didn't hear me.
I was scared to death."
"Sure, baby, sure.
Good job.
Now put on some clothes, we're getting out of here."
The girl scrambles after her blouse and Nick looks at Lou, who's mouth is slack.
"So what did you think, Lou " he asks him.
"That she was with you for the great sex?
Is that the money?"
Nick is nodding at the alligator case which sits on a night stand."
"That's it," says Gloria, buttoning her blouse.
"He was nervous about having it in the room.
Want to take it to the bank here and wife it the Mexico City.
But the banks were closed."
Nick has the top of the alligator case open and is looking down with a smile at all those neat stacks of twenties, just where they were when I saw them in Crawford's living room.
Nick admires them for a moment, then snaps the lid shut and hand the case to the girl, who's looking respectable again.
Gloria's all buttoned up now.
"Let's get out of here," she says.
"Just a minute," says Nick.
He walks over to where I'm laying, bends down, slips an arm under my shoulder and half lifts, half pushes me onto a chair.
Meanwhile, Lou seems to be coming out of his shock.
"Take the money," he says to Nick.
"The girl, too.
Just get out of here."
Just then somebody hammers on the door.
"Mr.
Carnesi.
Open up."
I figure it's the blunt little Mexican who rousted us in the lobby, and he seems to mean business.
"Open this door!"
It sounds like Cardini's voice, with most of the polish off.
"Are you in there, Jake?"
That's Suzie, screaming in the background.
Well, well, the gang's all here.
"Oh Jesus Christ," says Gloria, who sounds discouraged.
But all those voices in the hall seem to cheer Lou up.
"I got friends around here, wise guy," he says to Nick.
" They'll put you in jail to rot."
Nick doesn't seem to be bothered.
He's leaning over me, pressing something into my hand.
I recognize the cold slickness of my little Remington  The girl is amazed.
"Don't give him the gun, baby.
What are you doing?"
Nick ignores her.
He's threading my trigger finger through the guard and whispering in my ear.
"Shoot him, Jake.
Shoot the son of a bitch!"
I'm thinking about it.
Carnesi is losing some of his composure, babbling about something or other, his arms out.
I can't make sense of what he's saying, though it occurs to me he's pleading for his life.
I wonder absently whether Jeannie pleaded with him before he strangled her.
Somehow, I don't she did.
"I'm in hurry, Jake," says Nick.
"Shoot him!"
He lifts my gun hand "Goddamit," says the girl.
"Shoot him, Jake!"
Nick says.
"Why..?"
is all I can manage.
Nick is leaning real close to my ear.
"Like I told you.
I liked her, Jake.
I really did.
Now shoot him!"
I want to.
I think I can, if I concentrate.
The shouting from the hall is getting louder.
Nick glances in that direction.
"Oh well," he says.
I feel the gun being taken from my hand.
"You always did need someone to do the dirty work."
The cough from the silencer and the splat of the bullet hitting Lou in the chest are almost simultaneous.
I'm trying to keep from slipping down the black slope.
Lou has a hole in his shoulder above the heart, and there's a spray of blood on the wall behind him.
But he's still standing.
The banging on the door is louder.
Somebody's fumbling out there to get the key in the lock.
"We're coming in," a voice shouts.
