In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).

For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

"Lee, sweetheart, it's just me and you here, no one else.
Don't think of anything else except for me and you."
My anger flares.
"Don't talk to me like that."
"Like what?"
"Like I'm some victim, like I'm a mental case.
I know it's you here Robert and I don't want you to freaking touch me."
He backs away.
I see his hurt, and I think it's real - good.
It's about time someone else feels some pain.
"That's right I don't want you to touch me.
As a matter of fact I can't stand even the thought of your hands on me.
You don't love me.
I'm not even sure if you like me."
"Then why am I here?"
"I don't know, maybe I'm so damn easy to control you just can't give it up.
You like the power.
But Kari's not that easy, is she?"
I laugh.
"She played you for the fool you are.
Moron.
She has you trapped.
I bet you didn't even see it coming.
You never had to worry about that with me because the thought of having part of you growing inside me makes me sick to my stomach.
You're a heartless man Robert Cole.
You don't know how to love.
After you leave tomorrow stay the hell away from me, erase me from your memory."
"I didn't know you felt that way?"
He's definitely hurt, his eyes are glossy.
I stand my ground.
"Now you do."
"I almost wish I was screwing Kari, at least then I would have warranted such abuse.
All I've done is love you Leah, unconditionally.
Don't worry I'll figure out how to stop.
I'll leave you alone if that's what you want.
Goodnight."
He walks off to the guest room.
Guilt overtakes me.
I took out my frustration on him.
He didn't deserve that.
I wish I can take it all back.
I want to go apologize but instead I walk to my bedroom and close the door.
After popping another pill, I go to bed.
Maybe when I wake up tomorrow, I'll realize this was just a horrible nightmare.
Or better yet, maybe I won't wake up.
It's been two weeks since Robert left, and I haven't heard a word from him.
He is probably trying to make me feel guilty for the things that I told him the night before he left.
As for Kari she hasn't been returning my calls either.
I guess she's mad.
I don't really care.
These past two weeks I haven't done much.
Haven't really been out, except for Tuesday when I did that interview for the temporary staff accountant position.
They called me yesterday to tell me I got the job.
I'm starting on Monday - unlucky me.
I'll be working under a twenty-four year old that has a fraction of my experience and education.
Today I was planning on going to Center City to look around.
Maybe stake out the United Blue building and run over that bastard Jacob Boyd with my BMW as he crosses the street.
Instead, this morning I woke up depressed thinking about my new loser job and lost my appetite for murder.
Jerry Springer is on the television, they just came back from commercial.
Stephanie, a young woman in her early twenties is there to tell Keshia, her best friend since childhood, that she slept with her boyfriend Kevin.
"It was in the heat of the moment Jerry.
It just happened once," Stephanie, the backstabbing slut, tells the host Jerry Springer.
After Jerry's introduction, Keshia, the clueless victim comes out.
Of course she doesn't take the news well, but the girl is strong.
She doesn't break down crying, she immediately begins to beat the daylights out of Stephanie.
"Beat her down!"
I scream at the television.
"I had to deal with that crap for five years.
She's not a friend.
Beat her like an enemy.
Show no mercy."
Security breaks them up and now it's time for the boyfriend to come out.
"Baby, it was just that one time.
It meant nothing to me.
I was thinking of you the whole time."
Kevin's frankness hurts Stephanie's feelings so she attacks the guy.
"Did you think he loved you?
You dumb slut."
I shout at the TV.
Kevin ignores Stephanie's weak punches and focus on telling Keshia more lies in hopes she's dumb enough to forgive him.
"It'll never happen again," Kevin pleads.
Slap.
"That's right, hit him again.
He deserves it," I yell at the television while slapping my knee with each word.
The phone rings, but I ignore it.
Whoever it is, I don't want to talk to them, I rather watch people debase themselves on TV.
It makes me feel much better about my disastrous life.
"Good morning Leah this is Denise Kalzowitz from Finance Professionals."
At the sound of her voice I mute the TV and pick up.
Maybe she has another job that she wants to submit my resume for.
"Hi Denise."
"Hi Leah, I'm glad I got you.
I have great news."
The excitement in her voice amps up my mood.
"What's the news?"
I ask, almost cheerfully.
"United Blue called me this morning.
They want you on board."
"Excuse me?"
I know I heard her wrong.
"They want you on board.
When should I tell them you can start?"
"Start?"
I sneaker, the nerve of these people, "Please tell them I'm no longer interested in the position."
"You've found a job?"
Denise sounds confused.
"I didn't know you were working with another agency."
"I'm not," I lie.
"I found this job on my own."
"Have you started yet?"
"No."  "United Blue might be able to match whatever they are paying.
Would you like me to ask?"
"No.
I'm not interested.
I'm in the middle of something.
I have to go."
After hanging up with her, I don't give the conversation a second thought.
Taking the television off of mute I see that Jerry Springer has moved to another segment.
This woman, I didn't catch her name, just found out that her husband has been cheating on her with a stripper.
She's crying and asking him why.
"Why do you think dummy?
Because you're so damn weak, he knows you'll put up with it."
I scold my married counterpart on the other end of the television screen.
The stripper comes out and instead of the wife beating up the stripper the stripper is beating the crap out of the wife.
Where is the justice in this life?
Unable to watch the slaughter, I turn the channel.
Scanning channels I stop on a movie channel.
There's a movie on about a married woman having an affair.
About time we women start doing it to them.
See how they like it.
Something's vibrating on my bed.
I lift up my sheets and see that it's my cell phone.
"Hi Carol," I say after muting the TV.
Wasting no time she immediately begins to complain, "Why haven't you been returning my calls?"
"I've been working twelve hours a day trying to catch up and understand the insurance industry?
It's extremely complex.
I haven't gotten a chance to socialize."
"I'll accept that excuse this time.
How do you like it?"
"I love it.
It's just so...Awesome.
Great.
Fantastic."
"Any good looking guys?"
"I haven't been looking."
"You need to start.
How about PA, do you like it?"
"Love it.
I'm actually having lunch at Love Park as we speak."
"Aren't you cold?"
