This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Manipulation', 'tfidf': 1.505244493484497, 'lexical_unit': 'clasp.v / claw.v / clutch.v / finger.v / grab.v / grasp.v / grip.v / knead.v / massage.v / nip.v / nudge.v / paw.v / pinch.v / pull.v / push.v / seize.v / squeeze.v / tug.v / tweak.v / wring.v / yank.v / fumble.v / grope.v / stroke.n / rub.v / grab hold.v / pull.n / lick.v / touch.v / kiss.v / caress.v / caress.n / stroke.v / diddle.v / hold.v / tickle.v / handle.v / kiss.n / poke.v', 'definition': "The words in this frame describe the manipulation of an Entity by an Agent.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

If he wanted to come in, he could, but I wasn't in the mood to stand on my doorstep and try to figure him out.
The front door closed, a few hesitant footsteps sounded in the hall, and Phoenix walked into the room.
He cut a lonely figure, and I did pity him, but I wasn't sure what he wanted from us, not truly.
"I needed some air," he said, taking a seat next to me.
"So you came inside?"
"Anywhere is less suffocating than home."
He rubbed his chest and gazed around the room, anywhere but at me.
The silence made me uncomfortable.
"What is it you're looking for?
You keep coming back here."
"I don't know what else to do.
They're here.
The answers are here, and yet, they might as well be far away."
"You'll prove yourself, and then the twins will trust you.
Everything will work out."
"Will I?"
he asked anxiously.
"What if I can't?
What if I don't deserve a chance with them?"
"For Fionnuala's son, you're pretty concerned about doing the right thing."
He smiled, a faraway smile.
"My mother once told me I was exactly like my father.
She intended it as an insult, but the words meant the same as yours."
"I heard about him.
Conn, right?"
He turned in his seat, his eyes bright and eager.
"What did you learn?"
"That he was a warrior, well loved by the fae.
I heard that your mother only held on to her position because she married him.
You disappeared after he died, and you suddenly reappeared when talk began about Fionnuala not having an heir."
His hand went to his chest.
"I remember him being dead.
I remember seeing his body, but that's when things start to blur.
That was the beginning."
I set down the hot-water bottle.
"Thing is, I heard that he was sick in some way, but a witch cured him.
Then he died of some wound."
He gazed at me in horror.
"Did I...?
Was that why I was exiled?
Because I caused my own father's death?"
"No, idiot."
He jerked as if I had slapped him.
I apologised swiftly.
"I was thinking that maybe Helena cured him, that maybe you decided to run when he died because you knew what really happened to him."
He sucked in a harsh breath.
"You believe he was murdered by my mother, don't you?"
"It fits with everything else that happened.
Maybe you saw what your mother was really capable of, and you knew running was the only way to keep Helena out of her sights.
But along the way, something went wrong."
He pressed his palm to his forehead.
"If only I could remember.
Everything would be so much easier."
I thought of Nancy.
"Maybe it wouldn't be.
My grandmother's memories are tormenting her.
Maybe the memory loss is protecting you."
"I would rather know.
I don't remember being in love.
My wife must have been my first love.
Do you know what that is like?
And how it feels to lose it all?
Because I don't."
I nodded.
"I was separated from my first love.
It took me a long time to get over it."
"Tell me what happened."
He was so eager to know about other people's experiences and memories that I couldn't stop the words spilling out of my mouth.
"My grandmother was strict with me when I was a kid.
Shit happened.
I met a boy.
Life got better.
When I was eighteen, things got hot and heavy, and I almost drained him.
I left and didn't look back."
"You never saw him again?"
"Actually, I saw him recently.
My grandmother has Alzheimer's.
I didn't know, but he's been taking care of her."
"Sounds perfect," he said, looking surprised.
"A second chance."
"Not everybody deserves a second chance," I said grimly.
"He's not a good man?"
"He's a great man.
I was talking about me."
"Is this to do with the child?
The boy who lived with you.
He and his father."
I shook my head, sort of surprised.
"No.
It's only to do with me.
Sometimes you can't go back.
Even if you want to.
Sometimes you shouldn't go back.
It's not like with you and the twins.
I really believe that you all knowing each other will make your lives better.
I'll only bring my old love danger and pain and fear because that's all there is in my life.
No matter what happens, something else comes along.
And my grandmother... her memories of me are killing her, terrifying her.
I can't even go to see her because she freaks out so much."
"I'm sorry," he said.
"I wish I could help."
I caught his eye, and my heart raced in triple-time.
"Actually, I think we might be able to help each other."

My grandmother sat on a comfortable-looking armchair in the living room, moving knitting needles that held no wool, a frown furrowing her brow.
She muttered rapidly under her breath, and after a moment, I realised she was praying.
Tears rolled down her cheeks.
Wesley pushed me into the kitchen.
"I told you she was deteriorating, Ava.
She's not comfortable here anymore."
"I know," I said.
"I just wanted to say goodbye."
"Goodbye?"
He took my hands and squeezed them gently.
"Don't do it.
Not again.
We've only just found you."
"It's too complicated to explain," I said.
"I haven't told you the truth about everything that's been happening, and that's because you don't belong in my world."
"I've always belonged to you."
I squeezed my eyes shut to stop the memories flooding my mind.
His hand left mine and stroked my cheek.
I automatically leaned into his palm.
"Don't leave this time, Ava."
"I'm sorry I hurt you," I said.
"It won't happen again.
It'll be over soon."
"What are you talking about?"
he whispered.
"I need you to forget about me."
He leaned his forehead against mine.
"Never."
He kissed me, and I wrapped my arms around his shoulders, feeling like a teenager again.
Everything he had done for me--the way he protected me, did his best to make me happy and to show me how to fit in--it all returned to me.
I remembered his kiss and how much I had once needed him.
But those days were over.
I didn't need him anymore.
I wasn't a victim.
I refused to ever be a victim again.
And I needed to leave that past behind.
I needed to move forward without it dragging me back down.
I broke away, a little breathless.
"Goodbye, Wes."
"What?"
"You can come in now," I called out, running my thumb along Wesley's bottom lip.
Phoenix stepped through the doorway behind me.
I took one last look at Wes, hoping he would always be okay.
I went back into the living room and knelt before Nancy.
She had put her knitting needles aside, and her hands lay in her lap.
She smiled serenely at me.
