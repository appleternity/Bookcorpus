Headed due north in the direction of the city of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
A town of some three hundred and seventy two thousand people, referred to by some as the- 'Land of the Coyotes'.
The four men drive their two cars down the moon lit roads in a pensive mood.
The brutal killings of the nuns who stumbled upon their drug laboratory behind them, a thing of the past.
Now they face a more dangerous challenge.
Ricky Sinaloa, Ali Leon, Frankie and Tepo Nayari have to weasel their way past armed guards and drug dogs at a border crossing in two cars loaded with illegal drugs and unregistered weapons.
Scene 4 The Sinaloa Gang Takes A Meeting  Location: An all night restaurant in Nuevo Laredo Mexico At sunrise, Ricky and Ali pull the Chrysler and the stolen Mercury wagon onto the dusty gravel parking lot of an all night diner just south of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
While they clamber out of their vehicles the men struggle to look business like and give the impression they are working men on a tight schedule.
This is an essential task for this particular set of 'desperados'.
A Police Officer just has to demand access to their vehicles, and the whole scheme comes unwound!
Ricky, Ali, Frankie, and Tepo have millions of dollars in kilogram packages of newly manufactured cocaine in the back of the Mercury wagon.
And freshly fired semi-automatic weapons under the front seats of both vehicles.
One by one, they make their careful way through the glass door of the restaurant.
One by one, they take seats at a window table remote from the ears of the wait staff.
As the sun slowly takes the place of the moon in the clear blue Mexican sky, the men fill their empty stomachs on nearly identical meals composed primarily of breakfast burrito's.
Ali doses his food with large volumes of Tabasco sauce.
Tepo winces at the sight of Ali's table manners.
He makes eye contact across the table with his equally upscale brother Frankie.
Both Ali Leon and Ricky Sinaloa realize Tepo and Frankie are thinking something like, "Leon is such a typical Mexican peasant."
In an effort to stave off sleep, the men wolf down volumes of fresh coffee, one cup after another.
This strategy, unfortunately, leaves them more nervous than alert.
Ali, Frankie, and Tepo turn their eyes in the direction of their leader, Ricky Sinaloa.
What will he have them do?
What's next?
As the men watch Ricky, it appears to them he is losing his nerve.
They see a pair of narrowed suspicious eyes, and a set of trembling fingers.
Is Ricky losing it?
Quite to the contrary, Mister Sinaloa is perfectly at ease with their most recent act of multiple homicide.
He is not in the middle of a flash back to last night's savage killing.
He is in the middle of a flashback to the time of his discharge from the Mexican army.
Under the watchful eyes of his 'companeros', Ricky's thoughts travel back to the six months he spent in the army stockade for assaulting an officer.
Compared to time in prison, more properly time in a military stockade, the psychiatric discharge was something of a relief.
While Ricky pictures the face of the psychiatrist in his mind, his hands tremble, the coffee slops out of his cup.
Does the psychiatrist know where he is at this moment?
Does the psychiatrist know what he is up to?
Ali, Frankie, and Tepo pick up on the look of terror in Ricky's blood shot eyes.
Frankie wonders if maybe it is time for him to take on the leadership role in the gang.
The glance Frankie shares with his younger brother Tepo is not lost on Ricky.
Ricky Sinaloa puts his cup down in the puddle on his saucer.
He stares at the other men, one man after another.
It is time for him to re-assert his authority over the group.
Sinaloa grimaces at Ali Leon in his 'tough guy' pose.
He says.
"When you get to the booth have your driver's license out.
Stick it right in the guys face.
Then hold up the Saint Christina sign in the windshield.
If he starts asking questions tell him you gotta get the car back to Del Rio where the nunnery is."
Ali nods in assent, he holds mute.
Leon would rather take orders from Ricky than Frankie.
The look on Ali's face says if he had a notebook and a pen he would be writing Ricky's orders down one by one and committing them to memory.
A fact Ricky and Frankie and Tepo know only too well.
Next, Ricky turns to Frankie's younger brother, Tepo.
"You do the talking.
Shove your license at the custom's guy so he can read your last name.
Then tell him your brother is driving the car behind.
Wave back at us and point to Frankie."
Tepo nods and breaks into an impish smile.
He savors the idea of telling a lie, playing a role, to someone above him and in a position of authority.
In spite of himself, Tepo feels a tingling sensation.
If the first car makes it through!
The second car will make it through!
Tepo bounces in his seat in the booth of the restaurant.
His eyes gleam from the excitement.
He wants to add something, some kind of bold gesture.
Thinking aloud, Tepo says.
"We got enough guns to shoot our way out if something goes wrong.
Take a few hostages.
Then cop a plane, fly back to Columbia and be big heroes!"
Even Tepo's older brother Frankie can see Tepo is going off the deep end.
In an effort to rein Tepo in, Frankie stares at his brother and says.
"If you got back to Columbia you might be a hero.
But in Texas they have the death penalty."
Frankie's remark is enough to burst Tepo's bubble.
When Tepo hears the phrase- 'death penalty' he shrinks down in his seat.
Frankie Nayari puts his cup down on his saucer.
Then he bites the index finger of his left hand.
While he stares at the manicured nail on the finger he tries to come up with some kind of an idea that will raise him up to Ricky's level in the esteem of the other men.
Finally, Frankie grins from ear to ear.
He glances at Ali and then at Ricky to get their attention.
Frankie says.
"Know what we should do?
We should buy a couple of big fertilizer sacks."
Frankie pauses for effect.
Ricky shrugs his shoulders and replies.
"O.K.
I'll bite.
What do we need sacks of fertilizer for?"
Frankie leans forward in his seat.
His eyes sparkle at the opening gambit left for him by Ricky.
"Simple," Frankie waves his hand and explains, "We buy a couple of fertilizer sacks and empty them out.
Then we put the dope in the sacks in the back of the wagon."
Ali is a bit mystified.
This kind of scheming is over his head.
He wonders if the other men are trying in some way to make him look like a fool.
Leon pushes his glasses high up on his nose.
Then Mister Ali Leon looks directly at Frankie, the eldest son of- 'Don Alberto Enrique Nayari'.
"What does fertilizer sacks do for the coke?"
"Don't you get it?"
Replies Frankie in a voice filled with contempt for the working class.
"The customs guy eyeballs the sacks and gets fooled into thinking we're gardeners!
Plus we get a bonus.
If they have cocaine sniffing dogs - the dogs smell the fertilizer, not the coke!"
Ricky, Ali, and Tepo stare at Frankie for a long moment.
Ali's mouth falls halfway open.
Tepo looks up at his brother in admiration.
There is a grin on his face extending from ear to ear.
Francesco Nayari's younger brother shakes his head back and forth slowly,  "Beautiful Frankie, Beautiful!"
Even Ricky has feelings of unreserved admiration for his rival, the older brother of Tepo Nayari.
"Hey!
Hey!"
Says Tepo in the loud boisterous voice you would expect from a fan at a baseball game.
Frankie laughs, nearly a giggle, at his own cleverness.
The sound Frankie makes is infectious.
Soon all four men are holding their sides and roaring in laughter.
After a while the noise catches the attention of their waiter.
The man in the apron stares at his customers while sitting on a stool at the counter.
He looks as if he is trying to match up their faces with a previous visit or maybe even a random street side encounter.
The waiter's studied look adds up to more scrutiny than the men can tolerate at this point in time.
Their goal, after all, is to make it across the border without drawing attention to themselves.
As soon as Ricky, Ali, Frankie, and Tepo spy the waiter glaring at them, they bring an abrupt halt to their mirth.
The room quiets down.
The waiter turns round and goes back to reading his newspaper.
The four men rise to their tired feet.
They put folding money on the table.
The Ricky Sinaloa gang strides through the front door of the restaurant, still surrounded by an air of confidence.
The Sinaloa gang entered the restaurant at sunrise in a state of clinical depression.
They are leaving the restaurant an hour or so later in a manic phase.
As the men climb into their cars, Ricky shouts to no one in particular.
"Find us a feed store Jefe!
We got a garden needs fertilizing!"
Scene 5 Concealing Evidence / 'Hiding The Stash'  Location: A farm supply store and a vacant lot, Nuevo Laredo Mexico Ali nods his head with a good deal of enthusiasm in response to Ricky's exclamation.
The two cars make their cautious way off the gravel parking lot of the all night diner and back onto the highway.
They motor north, deeper into the city limits of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
As the men search for a farm supply store, Ricky doffs his gang colors bandana and throws it onto the back seat of the Chrysler.
With one hand on the steering wheel Ricky reaches into a crumpled paper bag resting on the floor behind his seat.
Sinaloa rummages around in the bag for a while.
Then he pulls out a long sleeve shirt.
Ricky and Frankie smile at one another.
They both understand it simply won't do for Ricky to look like a gang member or display a tattoo of a spider web to the customs people.
With one hand on the steering wheel, Sinaloa puts the shirt on top of his sweat stained tank top.
He buttons up the sleeves, and by choice, he leaves the shirttails hanging in the breeze.
A short while later Ali locates a suitable feed store.
The men park their cars against the curb.
They go inside and pay cash for two fifty pound sacks of fertilizer.
Two by two, the members of the Sinaloa gang manhandle the hefty sacks back out to the Chrysler and the stolen Mercury wagon.
Ricky feels on top of the world.
In a voice filled with equal parts of enthusiasm and authority, he says.
"Let's put this stuff in the trunk of the Chrysler.
The springs on the wagon are sagging from the weight of the cocaina."
At curbside, the men drop the heavy sacks of chemical fertilizer on the ground.
