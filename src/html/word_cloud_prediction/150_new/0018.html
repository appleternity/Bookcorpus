In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's."}, {'frame': 'Communication_response', 'tfidf': 0.6564533799131491, 'lexical_unit': 'answer.n / answer.v / comeback.n / counter.v / rejoin.v / rejoinder.n / reply.n / reply.v / respond.v / response.n / retort.n / retort.v / riposte.n / come back.v / reaction.n / acknowledge.v', 'definition': 'This frame deals with a Speaker communicating a reply or response, a Message, to some prior communication or action, the Trigger.  \'\' \'The landlord has not yet replied in writing to the tenant objecting the proposed alterations.DNI\'  \'"No, I do not agree with you," responded another officer to the CEO.

And then, finally, I turned and walked out.
**** Somehow, I made it all the way to San Diego, although I was in no shape to be driving.
I was still shaking, from anger, from fear, and my gut was twisted into knots.
Chase opened his front door as soon as he saw me pull up, smiling big as he waited on me.
"Hey, baby, I've been--" He didn't even get to finish, I shoved him aside, dropped my bag and headed straight for the bathroom, making it just barely in time.
My stomach heaved and I retched violently, purging everything that was or had ever been in my system.
When it finally stopped I just sat there with my forehead leaning against the toilet seat.
Chase was suddenly right there next to me, with a cold wash rag.
"Come on, baby, lift your head up," his voice was so soothing; I felt it wash through my bones.
I wanted to just curl up next to him and stay there forever.
Instead, I shoved his hand with the rag away.
I sat upright against the wall, and closed my eyes.
I felt two tears roll down my cheeks and I was too exhausted to even wipe them away.
"Adam, what's wrong?
Are you okay?"
So we sat there, on the floor of the bathroom and I told him everything, from the beginning--how Kowalski had been bothering me for a while now, what happened to him today and what happened after he came back to the barracks.
Chase settled next to me and wrapped his arms around me, and for the moment I let him.
"Jesus, baby.
That guy is a bigoted asshole.
I have some comments about how they managed to let someone like him into the Marines but I'll hold those.
I'm so, so sorry Adam."
I leaned out of his embrace and looked him in the eye.
"That's all you have to say?"
He didn't answer.
"Don't you even care that I had to make up some big huge lie and tell people that you were marrying my cousin?"
His voice was quiet.
"Did they believe you?"
"I don't know.
Most of them don't usually believe the filth that spews from Kowalski's mouth, so I think they would believe me."
He nodded his head.
"All right, then."
He started to get up.
"You really don't care?
You should be yelling and cursing and hitting me--anything.
You should be pissed off that not only have I shoved you in the closet but I have to lie about who you are."
He sighed and finally looked down at me.
"Adam, of course I'm not happy about it.
But I don't know any of these people, so I don't give a fuck what they think about me.
If it makes it easier for you, then tell 'em I'm married to three wives with a dozen kids.
Whatever will keep you safe and coming back to me.
That's all I care about."
Then he turned and walked out of the room.
**** The final blow happened two weeks later.
The word was that Kowalski had been reprimanded pretty severely for what had happened that day and he had thankfully been keeping his distance from me.
In fact he never said another word to me and I didn't even hear him joking around as much with the other guys.
Field training was finally over for everyone and of course the guys all wanted to go out and celebrate.
We went to this little dive bar just off base, and commandeered the big booth in the back, telling the waitress to keep the pitchers flowing.
There were several groups of single girls in the bar, so I knew it would only be a matter of time before the boys all started pairing off with whichever cutie was speaking to their dick that particular night.
As soon as that started happening, that was my cue to start acting drunk and then leave so I could head to Chase's.
There was one chick that was seated at the bar and as I walked by once from the bathroom, she stopped me and tried to strike up a conversation.
I was polite and chatted with her then took the number she gave me and shoved it in my pocket before heading back to the table.
The boys of course razzed me about the "hot chick I was talking to," and I laughed it off.
As I sat back down, I noticed Kowalski had suddenly shown up.
He didn't say anything, just kept looking at me in that smug-ass way of his.
Later, I wished I had just turned around and left right then.
An hour later and the night was progressing as I had predicted.
I was the only one left in our booth and I was just getting ready to leave when I saw Kowalski talking to the chick at the bar who had hit on me earlier.
He was nodding back to the booth and then she turned and looked back at me and smiled.
Shit.
Now I really had to get out of here, no telling what he was cooking up.
Except she was quicker than I was, because the next thing I new there she was sliding into the booth next to me.
"Thank you for the drink."
I blinked.
"Drink?"
She held up her glass and shook it.
"The nice guy at the bar said you bought it for me."
Then she sidled up to me even closer so our bodies were touching, squeezing me into the back of the booth.
"I thought I should come over and say thank you in person."
Her eyes were staring directly into mine.
Then she was practically climbing on top of me, shoving her lips on mine.
I could still see over her head and staring right at us with a sick smirk on his face was Kowalski.
Motherfucker was gonna sit there and watch the whole thing to see what I'd do.
My gut twisted at the sickness of this whole situation.
"Mmm, you're so hot," she breathed.
She was running her hand down my chest and heading straight for the promised land.
I realized I was trapped, literally and figuratively.
So I tried to shut my mind off and once again, play the God damned part.
I started kissing her back and she was sticking her tongue in my throat.
I ran my hands up her thighs, toward her practically nonexistent skirt, intending to just slip my fingers underneath the hem, to tease a little.
Unfortunately that just encouraged her to start grabbing for my crotch and my jeans were just loose enough that she got a hand down there before I could stop her.
I decided that now, I could be justified in getting her to stop, using the excuse of being in a public place.
Kowalski was still leering at us, but he had got his show.
After I got her hand out of my pants and told her we couldn't do that here, she just got more animated.
"Oh yes, let's get out of here, go somewhere a little more private."
She jumped up and grabbed my hand and I decided to just keep going with it.
The other guys saw us leaving and yelled out the typical lewd comments to us.
Once we got out the door and she got in my car, I told her I wasn't feeling good, but that I'd take her home.
She pouted and tried to get me to change my mind but I refused, so she finally went inside her house.
It was late, but I decided to just head straight for Chase's now.
It was just a couple miles to the highway and another mile to the first rest stop.
I pulled in and over to the last spot in the parking lot, got out and threw up in the bushes.
When I was done I got back in my truck and leaned my head on the steering wheel, trying to get my breathing under control.
I don't think it had been normal since that girl had slid into the booth with me.
What the hell had I just done?
I hadn't been with anyone since I started seeing Chase.
No one had kissed me, no one had touched me, certainly no one else had had their hand on my dick.
I felt violated, I felt like I had betrayed Chase, like I was cheating.
I mean it was all fake and it was with a girl and thank God nothing had gone any further.
But, Jesus Christ.
I had passed another test to prove I was a heterosexual, but at what cost?
I felt like shit, I was numb inside.
And it was going to be a never-ending process, there would always be more "tests," more insane play-acting.
And I didn't think I could do it anymore.
**** It was nearly two in the morning when I got to Chase's, but I didn't want to wake him yet, so I sat in the truck for a couple of hours and then went and parked myself on his front stoop.
I dozed off leaning my head against his door.
So, I was woken up when he finally opened the door.
"Baby, what are you doing down there.
Get up and come inside."
I stood but made no move to go inside.
"No."
"No?
But why not?"
"Because that will make it too hard."
My voice was hoarse and it cracked as I spoke.
The look on his face suddenly got very serious and I knew he was bracing for what was coming.
"I can't do this anymore."
"Adam--" "I want to be with you but it's killing me.
Do you know what I had to do tonight?
This time that damn Kowalski trapped me into making out with a girl.
She was kissing me and I had to kiss her back.
Her tongue was in my throat and her hand was on my dick."
And finally, I saw it there on his face.
The crushing reaction of realizing your lover had cheated on you, even if not sexually.
The idea, the picture of someone else's lips and hands on your lover's body--no matter the reason--was crushing.
He tried to get it together, to hide it but I had seen it.
And it broke my heart to know I did that to him.
"It's ... okay ... ."
His voice was barely a whisper as he tried to tell me what he usually says.
But I could see it was harder this time.
And it would keep getting harder until the day would come where he wouldn't be able to say it.
And I couldn't hang on until that day.
"Dammit, Chase, it's not okay!
And I've had enough."
"Adam, you just have to hang on a little longer--" "Don't tell me I can "hang on."
You weren't the one with some chick's hands down your pants trying to not throw up because all you can think of is how much this is going to kill your boyfriend.
"And all the constant watching and looking over my shoulder at work, wondering if this is gonna be the day someone finds out.
It's not worth it."
His face paled.
I looked in those beautiful blue-gray eyes I loved so much and they looked dull and lifeless as he spoke.
"It's not worth it.
You mean we're not worth it?"
I couldn't say it, so I just turned and walked back toward my truck.
"Adam--" I turned but kept walking backward.
"You said it in the beginning.
I don't do relationships.
Now you know why."
I got in the truck, backed up and drove away.
**** My chest hurt so bad I had to pull over to the side of the road; I almost thought I was having a heart attack.
I think it was really all those horrible things I said to Chase trying to kill me.
I didn't sleep at all that night, and then slept for ten hours, all through the entire next day.
