There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).

NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.

'' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .' '' 'I was reading about dinosaurs all day.'

This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted.

I've heard of him," Dave said, thinking.
"And that's uncommon for someone of Glix.
He's that guy that the Space Chicken accused me of being."
'I've said too much.' "No, you need to tell me right now," Dave said sternly.
'It's just some guy.' "Why does David Gratton keep coming up?
What are the chances of me coming all this way and hearing more of David Gratton again?
What's he got to do with me?"
'He did a lot, that's all.
In David Gratton's life, he went a lot of places, gave a lot of talks, opened a lot of buildings, that's why you keep hearing of him.
He's no-one important.' "He's very important, clearly.
Why else would the Space Chicken care if I were him?"
'Try to forget about David Gratton.
There's nothing you can do.' "But it concerns my future.
What happens to David Gratton will change my life."
'Not really.' "Don't lie to me.
I know you well enough to tell when you're lying."
'And I know you well enough to tell that you needn't worry about David Gratton.'
Dave gave up.
All his attempts at anything seemed to result in failure and humiliation.
"We're going to find the Oak Tree."
Chapter 16 "Don't you think you're being a bit extreme?"
Quack asked down the phone.
"But You said he's evil," the Space Chicken countered.
"That's not really evidence to go on, is it?"
The Space Chicken was flabbergasted.
"But You said that.
And You're omniscient."
"Semiscient, I think you'll find," Quack said, straightening his metaphorical tie.
"Which means I'm unreliable.
Some of the time.
I'm sometimes wrong.
At least if I were wrong all the time, I'd be consistent.
That would be useful.
But I'm not."
"How would Your being wrong all the time be useful?"
"Because you'd always know what was right."
"How?"
"Because it would always be the opposite of what I said."
The Space Chicken put the phone down.
Any sort of illogical logic was fairly distressing, but pious inconsistencies could be infuriating, which meant they imperatively were.
"Can I go now?"
asked Michael Rowland Daffodil, a possible criminal.
But only in the future.
"No," the Space Chicken said.
"But I will remove your hand-wingcuffs, provided you stay in the car."
"What are you talking about?"
asked Michael Rowland Daffodil.
"You haven't got a car."
"I will have soon enough.
I'll also open the window slightly so you can get some cool air."
The Space Chicken walked up to a sailor who was standing by the side of the river Prong.
After leaving the train, with his wing cuffed to Michael Rowland Daffodil's wrist, the Space Chicken and Fred Jr, his son, had wandered around for a while, hoping to find the their prize, which was sitting in the major river of Gord.
"Excuse me," the Space Chicken excused, "but you look like a man wizened to the ways of the water.
Would you might helping me?"
"What do you want?"
"I'm looking to retrieve a holy grail.
It shouldn't be too much of a trying task."
"It's always me," the sailor grumbled.
"Listen, darlin', this God or god hasn't spurken to you.
You haven't been sent on some mission or owt by 'Im, so just farget abaht it."
"Look at me.
I have been sent on a mission.
I'm not like the other nutters who pass through here.
I'm a different nutter."
The sailor looked at him.
"Do Ah knoo yous from somewhare?"
the sailor said to the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack.
"Do you know who I am?"
"Oh, yeah.
You're that one as told us the world were gonna end."
He chuckled, though out of stubbornness, arrogance and antipathy, not out of humour.
A difficult laugh to pull off, but the trained mariner achieved it.
"You're the Paternal-" "No, I'm not!"
the Space Chicken squawked.
More calmly, he added, "I'm the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack."
"Ah, reeght," he said, both of them well aware that the sailor didn't know the difference.
"In that case, Ah can get yer hahly greel fer yiz."
The sailor used a variety of levers, pulleys, nets and rods to retrieve the grail.
Soon afterwards, the Space Chicken, Fred Jr and Michael Rowland Daffodil wound up in Gary's Vehicles, celestial treasure in wing.
Arriving there, they were promptly struck by how the majority of the interior of the shop was taken up by the gargantuan Spaceboat.
The Space Chicken found Gary, and, exchanging the aforementioned valuables, was entitled to take the Spaceboat.
Things were just about beginning to match up.
Chapter 17 "Clint?"
"Clein?"
"Are we going anywhere?"
"Yes."
"Where?"
"We're going to the Fez, of course."
"Yes, but are we actually going anywhere?"
"We're going Nekken, if that's what you're asking.
I checked a proper compass this time."
"You know what I mean."
"No, I don't."
"You can't pull that lie on me."
"Of course I know what you mean!
Do you think there's a chance in Tartarus I could fail to understand you?!"
"Clint," Clein said.
"We both know we're both thinking it.
Are we really going anywhere?
Do we really need to follow the Fez again?"
"Look, it's just what we felt like doing.
Some people feel like going to university.
We didn't, because we knew something else would come up.
This is it.
The Fez is a different path we can take."
The Space Chicken and Fred Jr drew up in the Speedvan.
"This might help your journey to go a bit more quickly."
"Space Chicken!"
the twins exclaimed in unison.
"Don't ask how I got this Speedvan back from Oprah.
I'm suffering from quite a lot of timelag as it is and I don't need a headache on top of that."
"Thank you," Clint said, clambering into the car.
"Now drive us to the Fez."
"What?"
"I said, 'Now drive us to the Fez.'" "What are you talking about?"
Clein explained, "He said--" "Yes, I know what he said."
The Space Chicken was beginning to get rather irritated.
'You may need to explain in greater detail.' "Fred Jr thinks you may need to explain in greater detail."
"Yes, we can hear him too," Clint said.
"And you decided to call him 'Fred Jr'?
Hm, interesting."
Clein said, "I didn't know you were called 'Fred'."
"That's beside the point!"
the Space Chicken calmly and politely explained.
"When I said, 'What?'
I was clearly mistaken in pre-empting your interpretation."
Clint and Clein stared at him blankly.
"What I had meant to say was, "Don't you dare think for a minute that I'm going to drive you to BongVe Bong.'
There wasn't meant to be much room for your interpretation."
"Space Chicken," said Clein, "please," said Clein, "could you," said Clein, "drive us up to BongVe Bong?
Please."
"No." 'Dad, you must help them.
All we shall be doing anyway is wandering around.
We have no proposed destination; we may as well help our friends.' "All right," the Space Chicken agreed.
"Get in, if you must," he said to Clint and Clein.
It seemed they must, for they clambered into the back of the Speedvan without a second thought.
"Um...
Space Chicken?"
Clein said.
"Yes."
"There's another man in the car with us."
"Ah, yes," the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack said very calmly.
"I have taken him hostage.
I did so at divine request."
"Has Quack actually asked you to take him hostage?"
"Well, no." Clint gasped.
"Have you gone beyond Quack?
Have you spoken to-- to God?
Does God exist?"
"No." "God doesn't exist?
