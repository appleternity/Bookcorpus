In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

            These words can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>

"I'm not interested in taking out any random girl.
Anyway, I think this conversation is over."
Aaron's eyes narrowed.
"You upset, Jase?"
As if sensing he should back off, he put up his hands and sat back, signaling he was no threat.
"I didn't mean to ruffle your sensitive feathers."
"I don't want to hear anymore."
Aaron blinked at him.
"Geez, are you really into her?
I didn't realize."
Jason released his breath in an attempt to expel some of the bubbling anger inside him.
At first, he'd pursued Izzy because of their physical connection, but seeing her work, seeing her with Nick, even seeing her temper spark, reminded him of the girl he used to love.
He liked her.
"Yes, I'm into her, so maybe you can stop talking about her like a piece of meat."
"All I'm saying is, in this town, status matters.
You honestly want me to believe you'd take your little photographer friend to meet your parents?
All that ass, as bodacious as it is, is not made for your kind of life."
Unable to form a coherent thought with the blood pressurizing in his brain.
Jason stood and walked to the door.
He opened the stainless steel panel and glared at Aaron.
"Get out."
Shoulders slumped, eyes bulging, Aaron stared.
"Are you serious, man?
C'mon, we can't hold a philosophical discussion?"
"Not about this.
I'm not doing this with you right now."
Holding the door wider, Jason lowered his voice.
"Out."
Aaron grabbed his tennis bag and his keys.
Stopping at the door, he looked at Jason.
"Look.
You'll cool off in a couple of days.
Just keep in mind what I said about the kid, even if you don't want to listen to the other stuff.
She'll be pissed if she thinks you're using the kid to get close to her."
Jason watched Aaron walk down the front stairs to his car.
Angry energy pulsed through him as he picked up the phone.
The voice on the other line didn't sound like the pink-haired punk rocker he'd met.
"Z Con Design Studio, this is Jessica.
How may I help you?"
"This is Jason Cartwright.
Is Izzy in all day?"
Her voice softened.
"Yeah, she's with a client now, but she's free the rest of the afternoon."
"Great.
Do me a favor and don't tell her I'm on my way.
I don't want her to become mysteriously unavailable."
He could almost hear the smile on the other line.
"I think that can be arranged."
He hung up with Jessica and grabbed his keys, then, taking in his sweaty appearance in one of the windows, he opted for a shower first.
Twenty minutes later, he was on the road to Pasadena.
Izzy might not want to see him, but for Nick, she'd hear him out.
When the ringing sounded in his ear from his Bluetooth, he answered automatically.
"This is Jason."
"You're out of time, Jason.
I'm going to need your yes answer now."
Jason navigated the freeway to Pasadena as he adjusted his Bluetooth.
"There you go again, Sabrina.
Assuming you still have some kind of hold over me.
You know what they say about assuming."
She let out a stream of curses worthy of a trucker.
"You're the one who'll be making an ass of himself.
You need to go ahead and play ball now, before things get dangerous."
"You wouldn't be threatening me, would you?
'Cause I can't tell you how bad an idea that would be.
I wonder how the police would feel about your little extortion scheme here.
I think it's a felony."
"Damn it, Jason.
This kind of money is a drop in the bucket for you.
Just pay me, and I'll be out of your hair."
"Skunk."
"What the hell are you talking about?"
"You're like a skunk, Sabrina.
No matter how many times you wash the smell out, it sticks around.
Even if I wanted to pay you, you'd only be back for more."
"Jason.
You need to listen to me.
Our bullshit aside, I owe money.
If I don't pay it, some goons are going to make Izzy's and Nick's lives hell.
You might think I'm a selfish bitch, but I don't want to see them hurt."
Would she really turn her drug friends on her own kid?
A cold chill crept into the base of his spine, climbing it like ivy in the springtime.
She wouldn't.
Even Sabrina wasn't that cold.
Though it wouldn't be the first time she'd resorted to violence with him.
"Wow, you've gotten better and more elaborate at your lies."
He took the exit for Izzy's.
"Try them out on someone who's not a chump."
Chapter Twenty   Izzy heard the ruckus in the front lobby and cringed.
Her head ached from another long night of worrying about the gallery opening, Simon's cold shoulder treatment and Sabrina.
The dull pain throbbed steadily between her eyes.
Her whole body felt like lead, otherwise, she would have peeked to see what the fuss was about.
But, exhaustion and the need to complete the final descriptions for the gallery photos, drove her to stay in her seat.
The ruckus and din, accompanied by heavy footsteps, drew closer to her office door.
Izzy looked up from the paperwork to find Coach Tisdale barging through the opening with Jessica at his back.
A cold chill skipped up her spine.
Nick.
"What's wrong with my son?"
Jessica crashed into Coach in her rush to get to the office before he did.
"Izzy, I'm so sorry.
I know you didn't want to be disturbed, but he just came in past reception and refused to come back at another time and--" She interrupted Jessica.
"It's okay."
Directing her attention back to Coach Tisdale, she asked, "Is Nick okay?"
Jessica excused herself, but not before shooting the older man a death ray glance.
Coach Tisdale stared after Jessica as blue hair flounced out of the office.
He shook his head.
"What kind of home are you providing for that kid?"
"I beg your pardon?"
Pissed, she shoved her hair into a ponytail.
"You still haven't told me if that kid is all right or not."
Izzy, exhausted, had to sit back down.
"He's not all right.
I don't know that the hell you're doing to him, but he's messed up."
Fear thundered through every nerve ending.
"Where is he?
What's happ--" Tisdale looked confused.
"He's at school."
Relieved, Izzy sat back down.
"Then, Coach, please tell me what you're talking about.
I'm too exhausted to try and figure it out on my own."
He leaned forward planting his hands on her desk.
"Don't act like you don't know you're throwing away his future.
This is all your fault.
A talent like his--" The herd of elephants wearing tap shoes in her head refused to stay still.
She snapped and shouted, "What the hell are you talking about?
You barge into my place of business, scare me half to death, insult my home and then my parenting.
Before we go on, I'd like to know what the hell you're talking about."
"What, are you deaf too?
Nick told me this morning he won't be going to Juniors this year.
Some nonsense about wanting to be a normal teenager for a little bit.
You've pushed him into making the wrong choice.
You've ruined his future."
Izzy allowed herself several deep breaths.
Nick wasn't in any imminent danger.
He'd just made a decision.
"I don't understand what the problem is, Coach?
Nick thought long and hard about his decision.
He didn't decide overnight."
He rolled his eyes.
"I can't believe the courts put someone like you in charge of the kid, especially his future.
What the hell would you know about his future prospects?"
Anger infused and fueled the demon elephants in her head.
She barely heard the remainder of Coach Tisdale's mutterings over the stampede.
She stood and crossed her arms.
"Because Nick believes in you as a coach, I'm going to make the assumption that when you say someone like me you mean someone who doesn't play tennis anymore."
She huffed in a breath and gave him a look that said she knew all about his insinuations.
"I'm going to make the assumption you have my son's--because that's what he is--best interests at heart, and that's why you're so passionate about this."
He stammered.
"I don't know what you think I'm insinuating but--" She put a hand up to stop him.
"I'm not finished yet."
She gave him a smile devoid of mirth.
