She looked around the room and didn't see any other reasonable hiding places.
It was the last thing she wanted to do but, after some thought, she decided to unfreeze and wake the girl.
In the air, directly above little Snipwit's body, she created a ball of matter and kept it airborne as it spun and pulsated.
She passed a hand over the girl.
"Thawian."
The girl returned to normal sleep.
Fynn gently nudged her.
The girl's eyes opened and immediately went wide.
She was about to scream so Fynn slapped a hand over her mouth.
Little Snipwit's eyes darted back and forth between Fynn's face and the ball of matter directly overhead.
Then the girl looked at Fynn and visibly relaxed at recognizing her.
Fynn bent over her face and whispered.
"If you scream, I'll make sure you never speak again.
Understood?"
The girl nodded.
"I'm going to move my hand.
Don't scream, or else!"
The girl remained still.
"How...where..."
"Where's the box with the necklace?"
"Wha..."
"The box.
You took it from my bed the day I left.
Where is it?!?"
The girl thought about it...and kept thinking about it.
After several moments, her face took on a sad expression and she quietly said, "It's important to you, isn't it?
The necklace, I mean.
Did someone special give it to you?"
Fynn couldn't believe it!
The girl wasn't the least bit afraid.
Nor did she show any remorse for taking something that didn't belong to her.
Fynn was momentarily thrown off guard and the last thing she came here for was conversation.
She gestured with her hand toward the ball of matter.
It grew and formed into the head of a lion.
It grumbled a deep, guttural growl.
"Where is it?!?"
she demanded.
Even though she gazed at the lion, the look in little Snipwit's eyes was distant, as though she had just ventured off to visit a distant memory, and didn't even see the lion.
"I suppose it is important, or you wouldn't have returned.
I had a necklace.
It was my mother's...but it was taken from me when I came here."
Then, as if she suddenly returned, she looked at Fynn.
"You could get it back for me!"
"No.  Give me the box or it will eat you alive!"
The lion bared sharp teeth and gave a fierce hiss.
The girl startled as though she just noticed the lion for the first time.
For a brief moment, her face registered fear but then a smile slowly formed on her lips.
"If it eats me then you'll never get your necklace back."
Giggle.
"If you get my necklace for me, I'll give you yours."
Fynn sighed in exasperation.
She looked down at Cnawan for help.
As the cat returned the gaze, Fynn saw her mouth turned at a slight angle, as if Cnawan had just said, Hmmm.
Interesting.
Fynn rolled her eyes and looked back at the girl as she dispensed the ball of matter with a flick of her wrist.
"Where's your necklace?"
The girl excitedly sat up.
"In the vault - upstairs - in Miss Snipworth's office.
I'll come with you."
Little Snipwit described the necklace to Fynn.
Then she went off on a tangent of how the necklace was a gift to her mother and how beautiful it looked on her, especially with her ivory dress.
"Oh, how I miss my mother.
I bet you miss yours, too.
We all do.
It's so sad how things happen.
I remember the time when my mother took me to..."
Fynn didn't have time for this.
She swung both hands through the air, in a circular motion, and said, "Haldan."
The blankets on the bed suddenly came to life and wrapped around the girl, like a cocoon from the neck down, and held her in place.
"Hey, wha..."
Immediately after, Fynn waived a finger.
"Freosan!"
The conversation abruptly ended and there was silence, once more.
Chapter 24 _______________________
If someone had cut the Happy Days' building in two, going right down the center of the stairs, there would be two identical halves.
The location and purpose for the rooms on both sides, upstairs and downstairs, was identical.
The only exception was that girls were on one side and boys were on the other.
Miss Snipworth lived upstairs on one side and Mr. Herman lived on the other.
The center of the building and the courtyard in back seemed to be the only neutral territory where both sexes encountered each other.
At the top of the stairs was a closed door with a sign: Nurse.
As Fynn crept upward, she had the sense, once again, that this place was more of a prison than a home; it was a sterile environment.
She resolved that it wouldn't hurt anything to give little Snipwit what she wanted.
If retrieving little Snipwit's necklace made her happy and Fynn got her own necklace back in return, why not provide this small favor for the girl?
At first she was angry that little Snipwit took her locket but, after thinking about it, she understood.
The girl simply wanted to have something unique, something special, to call her own.
Who wouldn't want that in an unfeeling place like this?
She made an assumption that Snipworth's office would be to the left, above the girls' side of the building, and Herman would be to the right, above the boys.
She turned left and encountered an unmarked, closed door.
"Flowan."
To save time, she poked her head through the door to look around before entering.
Bingo!
It was an office and she saw a vaulted door behind the desk.
Just as she was about to step through, she heard a gurgled sound in the hallway, almost like someone was choking.
She pulled her head out of the door and looked to her right.
Snipworth stood in the hallway in a nightgown; her face drained of all color, like she had just seen a ghost.
She must have seen the headless body standing at her office door.
It took a moment for her brain to recognize Fynn.
She pointed a shaky finger.
"You!
How did you..."
Fynn observed her face as she tried to make sense of it.
Before Snipworth could find her next words, Fynn waived a hand through the air.
"Forgietan."
She watched as the expression on Miss Snipworth's face went blank, and then return to shock at seeing Fynn standing before her as though she was seeing her for the first time.
Snipworth startled at the sight.
She slowly raised her arm and pointed a shaky finger.
"You!
How did you..."
Fynn giggled at the instant replay.
"Forgietan."
She watched as the blank expression turned to shock once again.
As Snipworth's eyes widened and she raised a pointed finger, Fynn cut her off.
"Freosan."
Snipworth looked like one of those pale mannequins, posing in a store window, but with a freakish expression on her face.
Fynn stepped up to her and wondered about something.
She put her fingers to both corners of Snipworth's mouth.
She was able to bend her mouth into an awkward smile, in spite of having been frozen.
Then she took the finger that was pointing, bent the arm slightly, and stuck the finger in Snipworth's ear.
Fynn stepped back and giggled at the sight.
Then she leaned in close to Snipworth and said, "You should see yourself.
You might even laugh."
Then, as she turned back to the office door, she mumbled, "You need to get yourself a sense of humor, lady."
Fynn stepped through the door and looked at the vault.
It was huge, nearly the size of a bank vault, which meant it had a thick door.
She took a deep breath, told herself to relax, and walked through.
Inside were shelves, crammed full of stuff.
At least Snipworth had categorized the items.
One area was nothing but stuffed animals.
Another section had books.
Various toys occupied more shelves.
There were a few hats and some small books that looked like diaries or journals.
As she stood there, she started to get angry at the thought of how all these personal items had been taken from kids.
A part of her wanted to empty the vault and take it all downstairs to give back to the boys and girls but there wasn't time and there were too many things.
She felt the cat's paw on her leg and looked down.
"I know.
Stay focused on the task."
It looked like Cnawan smiled back at her.
"You know, for a cat, you sure have lots of expressions."
She spotted a section with jewelry and walked over to it.
It only took a moment to recognize little Snipwit's necklace.
She scooped it up and walked out of the vault.
She was just about to walk through the office door and into the hall, when she heard a male voice.
Chapter 25 _______________________
"Greta.
Are you all right?"
Fynn poked her face through the door just enough to see.
A man stood next to Snipworth and stared at her.
He tentatively reached out and poked her in the arm.
"Greta?
What's wrong?"
