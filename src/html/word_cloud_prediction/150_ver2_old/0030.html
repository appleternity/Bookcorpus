In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

A Salient_entity which is deeply involved in the Situation may also be mentioned.  'You have but two choices for your daughter .'  While all the members of this frame denote possible situations, in principle, this frame could be split into a number of subtypes on the following basis:  ''1. Future.n, and most uses of alternative.n and possibility.n all evoke nothing more than a simple possible situation (not necessarily an Situation) with no Agent; the remaining frames would inherit from this. ''2. Use.n evokes different possible things that can be done with a Salient_entity (i.e., Purposes) and thus uses the Using frame; in this frame, the target denotes the Purpose that can be achieved. ''3. way.n evokes different events that can lead to an Outcome (not necessarily a Purpose); this frame should use the Means frame.  In this frame, the target denotes the possible Means actions. ''4. option.n, choice.n, and many instances of alternative.n and possibility.n, evoke possible Situations that an implicit or explicit Agent can bring about at will.  A Purpose that would be served by bringing these Situations about may be mentioned. A Salient_entity related to the Purpose may occur in place of the Purpose.

For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense.

Period.
Wolf had chosen well.
Man eased his arm from beneath her and lowered his head.
His senses were best in his animal form, even his half form was better, but when he touched her...
Skin softer than anything he'd ever touched before pressed against his lips as he kissed her collarbone; wanting more he ran his tongue in a long line tasting the sweet and saltiness of her skin.
He'd never explored the female body in such a way.
Raising his head he ran his finger over a puckered nipple then repeated the movement on the opposite.
He lowered his head and drew it into his mouth, sucking it, flicking it with the tip of his tongue.
He froze when a soft moan escaped her.
He stared for long minutes waiting for her to wake.
When she settled he laid his palm flat and caressed her body.
Her shoulders, arms, her stomach; he ran his hand down one thigh and up the other.
Nothing was left untouched as he memorized every inch of her.
Going further he rubbed her calves and ankles; he lowered his head to kiss her feet, her knees, and her thighs.
He spread them open and the soft curls between her legs brought a low growl from his human mouth.
She had been terrified of Beast in the beginning.
The smell of fear had always been a savored thing for Beast but it had a different affect when coming from her, creating chaos in the mind of the monster that operated on the simple instinct to survive.
There was no smell of fright on her now, only that of her arousal.
He buried his nose between her thighs taking a breath that doubled his chest in size.
He opened her legs wider, positioned his body between them and put her legs over his shoulders.
He kissed the inside of each thigh.
The skin was smooth, softer than that on her arms and legs and torso.
Resting on his elbows he opened the lips of her sex with his thumbs and ran his fingers between them.
Her breath came faster; he watched her chest rise and fall in short burst as he explored her core.
The soft sounds turned into louder moans when he inserted his finger and her hips started rocking back and forth as arousal coated his finger and ran into his palm.
He watched her, studied every panted breath, every roll of her hips.
He pulled his finger from her body and put it in his mouth.
How had he forgotten?
Her scent had called to them, the taste of her skin was good, what coated his tongue was--more.
He lowered his head and feasted.
Pure pleasure shot through his body with each pass of his tongue.
He knew when she woke but there was no stopping.
He would kill anyone--anything that tried, including her.
Her body began to jerk and convulse and she screamed out but not in pain.
He climbed her body, licking her skin as he went.
His erection throbbed, ached to be inside her.
When he reached her face, her mouth opened and he breathed in her exhaled breath, fisted a handful of her hair and threw a leg over his arm.
He groaned as he entered her.
So wet, so tight, so warm.
He stopped when he reached the end of her even though he was not completely sheathed.
He went still, stared down at her, breathing heavily in her face as he attempted to regain control.
He pushed further and stopped when a tiny pained sound escaped her.
He pulled out, just a little and pushed forward again, then out until just the tip of him remained inside before sliding back into the tight velvet that was his salvation.
She grabbed the sheets on each side of her body as he rode her, never breaking eye contact.
Her body was hot, feverish, as it changed to become like his.
When her body started to contract around him, squeezing him until he felt like he had to fight for every push and pull the last of his control snapped and he buried himself as deep as he could go in a powerful thrust.
She cried out, her hands leaving her sides as she grabbed his forearms, drawing blood with her nails.
He howled as his release filled her body.
She slept the day away in his arms.
He dozed some but he couldn't get enough of her.
He'd tried just watching her as she slept but he was powerless, mindless and he'd taken her countless times and still his dick was hard as stone sandwiched between his stomach and her hip as he watched her.
He was a slave to her body and to his.
The smell of her arousal hung in the air, still coated his erection.
Her body was slick with sweat from their earlier joining and the fever of her change.
His seed was still wet on her thighs from his last release and yet he rolled on top of her and settled between her glorious thighs.
He knew what hurt her, knew her limits.
She could take all his length and girth; her body stretching around him as it accepted what only he would ever give her.
Buried deep in her body he couldn't think.
Not with her wrapped around him so tight, stealing his words, all logical thought processes and control.
He could only feel the thick length of him push against the walls of her snug sex, felt every contraction whether it was voluntary or not.
When she opened her eyes he looked into them, searched behind them as he tried to see into her very soul.
Did she know she was his?
That he would die for her, kill for her--live for her.
Her mouth opened when he pushed passed a comfort zone for her.
He liked the sounds, not the ones that were caused by real pain, but the little surprised gasps that he knew now were caused by pleasure.
He wanted to feel her come undone beneath him; to lose herself in his touch.
He felt the orgasm tightened his body, and he lost control of his strokes.
He grabbed a handful of her hair and buried his face in it, took a deep breath, filling his lungs with her scent.
He moved his head and buried his nose in her neck and placed his hands beneath her ass, changing the angle so that she could take more of him.
Forgetting everything but the feel of her wrapped around him, taking him in, owning him, he barely registered her panted breathing, or heard the small sounds escaping her.
He bit down on her shoulder as his cock thickened further before he filled her again.
When his hips stopped jerking and his cock stopped jumping from his latest release he sat up, pulling her with him.
He was still buried in her body as he settled back on his knees with her on his lap, already hard again.
How could he make her understand?
Did it matter if he could?
Did it matter if she didn't?
Lust in any form is a bad thing for a werewolf.
The bloodlust that had been fine-tuned until he'd become the monster Master desired was nothing compared to the lust he felt for this woman.
It consumed his every waking hour and invaded the snatches of sleep he allowed himself.
The need to kill was still there, but dulled beneath the need to claim her in every way.
On the third day the fever that ravaged her body worsened.
He'd never seen anyone suffer from the bite of a wolf and he was physically ill from her suffering.
She refused all food and drink; too weak to do much more than lay on the pile of pillows.
He'd been pacing the small space since the sun rose, only stopping long enough to cover her body when she shivered, or uncover it when sweat poured off her, as he tried to figure out what to do.
If she would not eat or drink human food, maybe it was a fresh kill she desired.
He checked on her once more before he covered her burning yet shivering body with a fur blanket.
He could feel her heart beat; each breath she took was his.
Wolf wanted to lick her, Man wanted to hug her, Beast didn't think in terms of offering comfort (the concept was just too foreign); in the end he simply left.
He stepped onto the dilapidated back porch closing the door softly behind him.
He was torn between leaving her alone and finding something to relieve her pain.
Each day a plethora of new emotions hit him hard.
None of them matter at present.
Night had always been a welcomed thing for him and outdoors had been his first lover.
The sounds and smells of open land was a soothing balm on his soul or had been until her.
Now nothing would do until she found comfort.
His transformation was quick; there was no pain, only the feeling of calm as he changed into the horse size black wolf.
He moved like an apparition cutting through the trees, his inky black coat making him appear more shadow than flesh and blood.
Any other time he'd enjoy the freedom only his animal form offered but tonight wasn't about him.
With every step he scented the air searching for prey until he smelled something acceptable on the night's breeze.
He crouched low, his body becoming part of his surroundings even with his great size.
The buck stood motionless as he scanned the area for a threat, his nostrils flared, his ears scanned for his slightest noise.
The wolf stood still; waited for the deer to decide that it was safe and when the mighty creature dipped his head to eat, it pounced.
There was not time to enjoy taking down the animal as his jaws clamp down on the buck's throat and hot salty blood filled his mouth.
Turning into his half form he slung his kill over his shoulder.
No lights greeted him on his return; there was no electricity in the place.
He didn't need lights, he saw just fine in the dark and soon, so would she.
He laid the deer on cracked, rolling linoleum and went through the bathroom to the bedroom and found her lying as he'd left her.
He knelt beside her and pushed sweat dampened hair from her temple, tucking it behind her ear.
She sighed heavily and turned into his touch, snuggled her cheek into his palm.
The swell of emotion that tightened his chest he craved almost as much as her body when he wasn't half insane from her being ill.
He gathered her in his arms and carried her through the narrow doorways to the kitchen and sat with her in his lap.
With one swipe he opened the neck of the animal.
She stirred, growled low in her throat, the sound vibrating her entire body.
He leaned forward moving her head closer to the carcass.
Her lips peeled back from her teeth revealing fangs.
She opened her eyes and they were no longer brown but the color of the moon, so light blue the pupils almost disappeared into the whites of her eyes.
They were beautiful.
Weak from fever she struggled to get to her meal, but strong arms helped her.
When she struggled to tear meat he pulled it from the bones for her and fed her until she had the strength to do it on her own.
He stroked her hair as she fed.
Chapter Fourteen
Jo woke with a jerk in the dark room with no idea how long she'd been out.
Her last conscious memory was of her captor biting her again.
She knew from the lack of heat that he was not on the pile of pillows with her.
She'd dreamed of his human form; impossibly big, a body that was a work of art.
He looked: dangerous, unmovable, unstoppable, different from the monster that had kidnapped her, yet the same.
He'd done things to her in those dreams.
Things that made her heart quicken and her breathing uneven.
Every hair on her body stood at attention at the memory.
She swallowed or at least her mouth and throat made the movements; she needed about three gallons of water.
She sat up on the pile of pillows, the blankets that covered her falling around her waist.
Pushing completely free of them she stood and headed for the bathroom.
With every step a new memory made itself known.
She'd been sick.
He'd held her while she vomited and ... while she'd fed off a deer.
Her stomach rolled and she ran the last few feet to the tiny bathroom.
She crashed onto her knees and hung her head over the toilet, her fingers gripping the rim as she threw up.
When her stomach was empty she collapsed against the wall opposite the toilet and screamed.
The door she'd closed in her haste to get to the toilet was ripped from the hinges.
It hadn't been a dream.
The man standing in the doorway was the god she'd dreamed of, prefect from the top of his bald head to his massive feet.
She screamed again.
He didn't move towards her and eventually she closed her mouth.
There were no tears, and her throat, raw from the vomiting, was now worse from the screaming.
"No, no, no, no, no," she chanted, wrapping her arms around her knees.
She was naked, recognized the aches in her body.
The man standing in the room wasn't the only thing that was not a dream.
She'd had sex and lots of it.
Behind her closed lids each act played out again and again, she felt her body flush as she remembered how he touched her, his hands, his lips, his tongue.
She tried hard to control her breathing but it was a losing battle.
