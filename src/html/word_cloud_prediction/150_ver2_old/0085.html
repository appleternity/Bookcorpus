Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  \'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .\' \'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .\'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure "covering" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Distributed_position', 'tfidf': 0.8269673519353057, 'lexical_unit': 'coat.v / line.v / wreathe.v', 'definition': 'This frame involves a static (primarily spatial) relationship between a Location and a Theme, in which the Theme is located in many or all subregions of the Location, and is thus construable as covering it.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant.

Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations, 
            where each consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

She hoped they would not find her.
They did.
A few minutes later she saw the three figures emerge at the top of the dune nearest the edge of the rocks.
They saw her in the distance and they ran down the dune in her direction.
She was sure she was too tired to run again, but somehow she found the strength.
She turned and looked to the right.
She was standing next to the highest point in the dunes, and she ran in that direction with her heart racing and her legs hurting, lactic acid filling every muscle in her body.
She had the impulse to look to her left, and when she did, she saw a thin dark figure in the distance, perhaps three hundred feet away, standing in the line where the water met the sand, looking almost like a mirage.
It was him: the man who had so far protected her, but in what seemed like only limited, distant ways.
Yes, it's me.
Keep running, Jane.
They're not going to stop, so you shouldn't.
Yes, but what am I supposed to do?
There was hesitation.
I don't know.
But don't worry.
We'll work through this together, just keep going.
Okay, she replied.
She reached the top of the dune and looked behind her.
Lucas was starting up the dune behind her, only fifty feet away.
The other two men were not as athletic and had fallen behind.
Jane could see the metallic, sophisticated-looking weapon he held in his hand.
This gave her the last jolt she needed to turn and run again.
She ran across the top of the dunes where the grass and dirt was hard, not knowing where her strength came from.
She glanced behind and saw him striding towards her.
He was built for this, she thought.
She was running up the top of one of the tallest dunes when she found herself getting desperate.
She reached the top and looked at the vast sea in front of her.
She searched for Max and found him quickly, once again in the distance, looking at her.
She reached out for him with her thoughts, a faculty she had not been accustomed to using until recently.
Now circumstances were pushing her to use these abilities in new and unexpected ways.
Max, what do I do?
Help me!
You have to fight him, Jane.
It's the only chance you've got to get away.
Scan the area for something you can use as a weapon.
She was about to protest, but realised there was no point; she knew what Max had said was true, so she turned to the sand below her and reached out with her thoughts, passing them over the ground as one would run a hand over some intricate pattern.
Her mind passed over freezing cold, damp sand and pieces of rock.
The taste and smell of sea salt filled her senses as her mind ran over the frigid surface.
Too small, she thought as her mind grasped at one piece of rock.
No good.
A chunk of glass came next.
No, too dangerous.
He was coming up behind her.
She could hear his heavy footfalls in the sand coming down like tree trunks.
The sound of his ragged breathing rose up in the background.
He was only twenty-five feet away now and was starting to slow down.
She didn't need to look around to see him aiming his weapon at her; the image flashed inside her mind.
She turned and looked in his eyes, her blond hair blowing around her.
That surge of anger and defiance returned and showed on her face.
He seemed shocked by what he saw.
She kept scanning the ground with her mind in the background, desperately looking for something she could use.
She was aware somehow of Max watching them intently, a distant third party who seemed to be only a witness at this time.
"Jane, you're coming with us whether you want to or not."
"Come where?
Why?
What the hell are you talking about?"
she yelled back, stalling him, still scanning the sand below.
"You have to be contained."
"Why?"
"Because you've demonstrated extreme ethereal ability, and you used it to endanger a civilian."
"You're lying," she said flatly, shifting her position on the sand as she stared into his eyes.
This seemed to give him pause.
His stance grew solid then, and he planted his feet firmly on the ground.
He raised the weapon higher, aiming it directly at her torso.
"Don't move!"
he yelled.
She glared at him.
She needed only a couple more seconds, she thought, to find the right weapon in the sand below.
Her heart was beating fast, and all of her psychic sense, which before she had very much blocked out, was coming online.
Images and understandings about this man flooded her mind.
There were reflected images of things she didn't want to know about him--things she didn't want to see.
But there was something lurking just beneath the surface, something big.
She hesitated, still scanning the ground below her, because she knew instinctively that this thing near the surface of his mind was important.
It was beneath the basic thoughts, hidden, but not well--something he took out and thought about frequently.
She had only seconds to look.
She couldn't discern what it was, but she had the vague impression that it was connected to her.
A gasp escaped her lips as this realisation came into her mind.
She pushed the images aside as she found what she was looking for: a dull, hard object just less than two feet long.
She knew exactly what it was the second after her mind had discovered it--a brick from one of the houses that had collapsed nearby due to erosion.
Her mind tugged on the brick.
Gently, she thought, and she felt it respond to her will.
Her cells began to light up with that same feeling she had experienced on her doorstep.
She pushed herself harder, moving the brick off the sand.
She turned and jumped the six-foot drop onto the dune below her.
She heard him yell, "Damn," behind her, but she was too focussed on the brick to pay him any further attention.
Good, Jane, now lift it! she heard Max say clearly.
She did exactly what Max said.
She focussed on the brick as she ran down the dune.
The surge of defiance she felt became a beam of power.
The block rose in front of her, obliging her mind.
Sand fell from it like a waterfall.
She ran past the block as it rose upward; she raised her hand, directing it towards Lucas.
The block flew through the air, and she heard and felt a dull thud as it hit his shoulder hard.
She heard Lucas gasp and collapse on the sand behind her.
She stopped and felt the power completely drain from her body as she turned around rapidly.
Did I hurt him...is he okay? she asked, calling out to Max. No.
You didn't hurt him, he's just stunned--a minor injury.
He'll be okay, I promise.
KEEP GOING, she heard Max say.
Her instinct was to check on Lucas, but she unwillingly pulled herself away from the scene and began running again.
She reached the shore a moment later.
Once there, she ran parallel to the dunes where the thin film of water washed around her feet.
The surface was flat, and she had good traction there as she sprinted onward.
Max hovered in front of her, floating about ten feet above the water and one hundred feet ahead of her.
His image was the only thing that kept her moving, as lactic acid now seemed to send screaming sirens from the muscles in her body, begging her to stop.
Her lungs burned with each gasp of cold sea air, and the sound of her deep footfalls on the tough sand echoed dimly back to her.
She risked one look behind her and saw the two other men attending to Lucas as the dune slipped out of sight around the corner of another embankment.
The men were picking him up by his arms.
She felt a pang of regret, but it faded quickly as one of the men looked out towards her.
She turned back around and kept running.
A few minutes later, she was out of their sight.
She glanced around and saw this.
At that point, her mind finally started to relax.
The sun, now a glowing orange disc, cast spectral dances over the small, gentle waves.
Suddenly it was beautiful to her and no longer foreboding and ominous.
The cold January wind blew at her face; it was no longer distracting, but refreshing.
"Can I slow down yet?"
Yes, you should.
You're going to need your strength.
Max was moving towards her across the water with his coat fluttering slightly in the breeze.
She slowed to a light jogging pace, but when she found even that too much, she resorted to walking.
After a few more minutes, she stopped and leaned over, placing her hands on her knees and gasping for breath.
She rubbed her sleeve across her face and saw a pair of feet in front of her.
She looked up and saw Max standing a few feet away.
At first she didn't know what to say to him.
Then she simply said, "Thanks."
You don't have to speak aloud if you don't wish to.
I can hear you telepathically.
She smiled at him and replied, "Oh yes.
Thanks for the reminder."
She laughed at the idea of discussing such a thing so casually, but then the laughter felt like thorns in her throat, and she began to cough.
He stood in front of her as she held her stomach, breathing deeply.
Gradually she began to regain her strength and looked up at him.
He smiled at her.
He appeared young now--younger than she could remember seeing him before.
In the strange, otherworldly garden from the dream of her youth, he had appeared older.
Now he seemed to be in his mid to late twenties and he had the twinkle of youth in his eyes.
Can we move ahead now, Jane?
Are you strong enough?
"Yes," she said aloud as she began to walk beside him.
She looked at him and smiled.
"Sorry, I think it's going to take a while for me to get used to that."
"That's okay.
We can talk aloud if you wish.
Although it may be better for you to exercise your telepathic ability somewhat.
That, and your psychokinetic ability."
"Why, you think I'm going to need it?"
He paused before answering.
"Yes, it looks as though you probably will," he said after a moment during which he looked out at the sea, its waves producing overlapping golden crescent arcs among the wash of white foam.
