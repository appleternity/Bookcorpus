In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.

On a desk there was a computer and phone.
She just had to call her mother and tell her the news.
First she had to use the bathroom to wash her face and hands.
Coming back to the phone, she noticed the bed was king size.
"Looks like lots of room to play around," she mused out loud.
Mother answered on the first ring.
"Mom, are you sitting down?
I have something to tell you."
The excitement in her voice and her mother telling her to slow down brought Jen back to normal.
"Todd asked me to marry him and I said yes."
Mother started crying in the phone.
"Forgive me Jen," Mother said.
Then both of them were crying and after a few minutes, mother said, "What is the date?"
Jen told her she didn't know.
"We will talk about it later and I will call you when we set the date."
She wasn't crying anymore and she went on to say, "Mom, make a list of guests.
Of course Beth will be my maid of honor.
Father Paul should be made aware of the upcoming wedding.
Oh, mom, I'm so happy.
I wish you were here.
No, I wish I were there with you and dad."
"Dad is standing right here trying to listen as we talk.
Tears are running down his face.
We love you very much and dad so wants to meet your man."
She hung up and went back and washed the dried tears off her face.
Jen was busy putting unpacking their clothes.
Hanging up her sun dresses and the other things she put in a drawer.
The chest of drawers was very old.
Beautiful wood and the drawers were deep and spacious.
She put her things on the left and his things on the right side.
Both had packed light.
She was hoping she could do some boutique shopping while they were here.
She packed up a negligee from Fredrick of Hollywood.
Beth had given it to her for a Christmas present last year.
She put it in the drawer for later.
She had just finished with putting their things away when she heard the door open and she knew it was Todd coming in.
Chapter 7
Todd called out her name.
She came in from the bedroom.
He had on a very sad face.
She gave him a big hug.
"Come sit down and tell me about your friend."
He sat in an old rocker that might have been his grandfathers.
She sat on the floor on a Mexican rug in front of him.
Took his shoes off and massaged his feet.
He leaned back and closed his eyes and enjoyed the feeling of her fingers on his feet.
After a few moments, he raised his head up and looked at her.
She was looking at him with a worried look on her face.
He knew she was feeling his pain too.
"What a woman," he thought.
"Honey, John is dying.
A few days at most and he will be gone.
Lung cancer and he was never a smoker.
He was and is a great guy.
Like a second father to me.
I spent many summers here with them playing with the other kids.
He'll be buried in the family plot on the hill behind the house.
He's in no pain.
Our nurse is with him and gives him regular pain medication.
We had a good talk and even though his voice was weak, he words were clear to me.
I promised to take care of Alice and he smiled and then he went to sleep.
Now, I must call grandmother and fill her in."  Jen got up and brought him a portable phone.
He pulled his tie off and unbuttoned his shirt.
She finished the job for him and ran her fingers through his hairy chest.
"Hello grandmother, I know it's late back there but I wanted to fill you in on John's condition.
He has only a few more days and then he will be gone.
He's comfortable and will pass on with no pain.
I'll call you again in the morning."
He listened for a few minutes and then he said "Good bye" and put down the phone.
"Let's take a shower before dinner," She said with a smile trying to take his mind off the trouble with John.
"Good idea, but the shower is small and it will be kind of tight in there."
She pulled him to his feet and into the bathroom they went hand in hand.
After a pleasant shower, they laid on the bed talking about their future.
Todd and Jen discussed when they would get married and they decided a spring wedding would be nice.
He said, "A small wedding would be best, but I understand the need for a larger one.
The society pages will sit up and take notice as soon as it's advertised we're to be married.
The Lincoln name is big in some circles and I'm one of those 'Most eligible bachelors' you read about in the society pages.
Grandmother has so many friends and business associates that'll have to be invited.
You'll need a big truck to carry off the presents."
She laughed and said, "My dad will be so emotional.
He'll not be worth much, but mother will handle all the preparation work.
If your grandmother will give my mother a list of guests, that will help her make a plan.
I think we should hire a professional person to make the wedding arrangements."
He agreed with her.
"Now it's almost time for dinner and I'll get dressed."
They both got up and put on some casual clothes for dinner.
Maria knocked on the door and Todd said through the door they were on the way.
The food was good.
Mostly Mexican food with some American dishes for the guests, such as, fried chicken and a beef barely soup.
A large dining room held about twenty people and tonight it was full.
A large chair sat at the head and it was waiting for Todd to sit in it.
An empty chair stood next to his right and that was for Jen.
Sadly it was a somber affair.
Alice sat to Todd's left and they whispered to each other throughout the dinner.
Jen was so hungry she shocked herself by eating so much.
She ate mostly Mexican food and marveled at the fine taste of it.
She noticed standing back by the kitchen door a large Mexican woman was watching her eat.
She was obviously watching to see if the special lady of Todd's was enjoying the dinner.
After dinner they went for a walk around the compound.
He told her about the vineyard and its parts that made up the place.
First he told her about how many people worked and lived here.
He said, "We have more than one hundred workers and their families.
Most live to the north of here around the other side of the hill.
We built small but nice houses for them.
Water, power and septic system is in place.
We even have a little market for them to shop at.
Fresh food is brought in everyday.
Like a company store in the old days.
However, we only charge them cost plus what it takes to operate the store."
They passed a building with the lights on and workers looked like they were busy with a whole bunch of golf carts.
She asked him, "Why so many golf carts?
Is there a golf course nearby?"
He laughed, No. no golf course.
Workers use them instead of gasoline powered vehicles.
Electric carts work well for us and the grapes don't have to breathe the fumes of gasoline cars.
There is enough pollution in the air as it is, why make more pollution."
They walked on and she noticed a sign that said clinic on it.
"What is that?"
she said.
He told her they had a small clinic for the workers and their families.
"A RN is on staff everyday and twice a week a doctor friend of mine comes up for some of the more serious cases.
We find it is cheaper than providing medical insurance to the people."
He had his arm around her and said, "Let's go back to our house and make love."
She leaned her head on his shoulder and turned him around and they headed back for a night of love making and quiet talk under the sheets.
On the way back he told her that tomorrow he would show her a surprise.
He would say no more and a feeling of well being flowed through her body.
"Tomorrow will be an exciting day."
She said to herself.
Chapter 8
The next day dawned bright and clear.
Hardly any trace of rain was left.
No wind was blowing and Jen heard the birds singing in the big oak trees.
Sounds of workers taking in Spanish could be heard.
She heard someone say loudly, "Speak English.
You're not in Mexico anymore."
Jen lay there smiling and Todd was still asleep.
She watched him sleep and noticed what a strong nose he had.
Powerful eyebrows that was dark and full.
They were connected to make one dark line of eyebrow.
"Very sexy," she thought.
She traced his cheek down to his chin with her fingers.
He made a small sound in his throat and opened one eye.
She ran her fingers over his lips and he opened his mouth and took a finger in and sucked on it.
He reached out for her and they made soft and tender love reaching a place where now, they both understood.
After a shower they went to the big house and they had breakfast alone.
Todd first went to check on John and then he returned to say no change in his condition.
He was sleeping and he sat down and they had oatmeal and homemade bread for toast.
A big jar of homemade black berry jam sat on the table.
Coffee mugs full of his special coffee were already poured for them.
Someone must have seen them walking down to the big house.
