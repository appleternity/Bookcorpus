This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.

LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  \'\' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  \'Hawke\'s Bay winery doubled in size last year.\'  \'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.\'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP\'s like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   \'\' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  \'(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\' \'(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.\'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  \'(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.\'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  \'(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\' \'(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.\'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  \'(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001\'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP "turbot catches" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  \'*Turbot increased in catches.\'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  \'(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to "the people", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  \'(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP "the population of Smallville" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer "of Smallville" is tagged as Item.   \'(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' \'(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  \'(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  \'(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\' \'(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\'  There is no Attribute "1999 price" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as "price" on the 2nd layer.

Jeb, with Seth following and squirming in the saddle, stopped on the edge of a mountain meadow.
Relatively treeless and grassy, the meadow stretched slightly uphill about 400 yards and was at least half that wide with a small stream meandering through it.
Becoming more and more cautious and alert, Jeb surveyed the perimeter intently, then dismounted and, as he pulled his rifle from the scabbard, spoke to Seth, "Guess it's time for a quick shootin' lesson.
I figure your buddies won't be able to get it together 'til mornin' and will be on us by mid-morning.
Go ahead and get down from there.
We'll tether the horses here."
Seth was more than happy to abandon his torture seat and get his feet back on terra firma.
He dismounted and followed Jeb's lead as he found a couple of saplings to wrap the reins around.
Jeb reached in his saddlebags, retrieved a box of shells and his binoculars, and then walked over to a log where he began loading the gun.
He talked to Seth over his shoulder, "Grab that rifle out of your scabbard and some ammo out of your saddlebag.
Bring 'em over here."
Shortly, Seth joined Jeb by the log.
Jeb began to lecture as he continued loading, "OK, boy, this here's a Seko, bolt action, 30.06-caliber rifle with a Leopold three-by-nine variable power scope.
I shoot a Spitzer boat tail with a 150-grain bullet.
Its effective range is 400 yards or so dependin' on who's doin' the shootin'.
It holds six rounds including the one in the chamber.
I realize you probably don't care about this, but the point is, it's important to know your weapon.
This is a long-range, big game rifle.
Yours, on the other hand, is a Winchester Model 70, lever-action, 30-caliber saddle gun.
Its effective range is only 150 to 200 yards.
Now, you ready to give it a try?"
"I guess so."
was the tentative response from an overwhelmed protege.
"Before we start," Jeb continued, "there are a few gun rules you gotta know and don't ever forget 'em when you're around me.
Number one, never put a rifle in your scabbard with a bullet in the chamber.
You don't want to shoot your horse.
Two, never take the safety off 'til you're ready to shoot.
Three, never shoot from horseback if you can avoid it.
Four, always use a dead rest to make sure every shot is a good one.
Five, always make sure of your target.
If there is any question at all, don't shoot!
And six, never kill anything just for the sake of killin'.
Only two reasons for killin' anything and that's self-defense or food.
Understand?"
"Yes sir, I think so."
"OK then, let's get started."
Jeb spent the better part of an hour patiently teaching Seth the finer points of marksmanship.
Seth became engrossed and absorbed everything Jeb had to say.
He asked a myriad of questions which Jeb patiently answered one-by-one.
The adversarial barriers of their initial encounter were beginning to melt and the seeds of a lasting relationship were starting to take root, though neither man was yet ready to admit it.
At the end of the session, both were lying back against the log, Jeb puffing away on his pipe.
Finally, Jeb got to his feet.
"Well, let's get on up the trail and find us a good campin' spot.
It'll be gettin' dark in a couple of hours."
The two mounted up and Jeb led the way across the meadow and on up the trail.
It was almost dark by the time Jeb had selected a suitable campsite and they got things unpacked and set up.
The eight-by-ten canvas wall tent was overkill for only a couple of nights on the trail, but Jeb, with a lifetime of experience, was able to erect it quickly.
He was quite efficient as the skills all came rushing back and Seth did what he could to help.
By the time the blackness of night in the pines became a reality, there was a blazing campfire inside a stone ring, and a Coleman lantern burning brightly in the tent.
Seth was crouched by the fire absentmindedly poking it with a stick when Jeb emerged from the tent and joined him.
Neither spoke for a minute.
Finally, Seth said, "You really think those guys will follow us up here?"
"Yep, I 'spect they were told not to come back without your scalp."
"Why don't we just run from them?"
Jeb reflected a second before answering.
"Son, you never want to be the hunted if you can avoid it.
If we make a stand here, it'll be on our terms, we'll control the situation.
Now, let's get some grub."
*                      *                      *
The next morning, Jeb was up before light, had the woodstove fired up, a pot of coffee perking and the bacon on.
Eventually, he turned up the Coleman, walked a couple of steps to where Seth was snug in his sleeping bag and kicked him into consciousness.
"Wake up, boy.
Come on now.
We have to get ready for the party."
Seth struggled to his feet, pulled his pants on and buttoned his shirt.
Then, he got his boots on from a standing position, a real challenge in the unsteady early morning he discovered.
As he turned toward Jeb, he was startled by his outstretched hand offering a hot cup of coffee, "Here, this'll get your motor running.
Go on out by the campfire and I'll bring out your breakfast in a minute or two."
Seth went outside and, in a short time, Jeb came out to the fire with a plate of chow in one hand and the coffee pot in the other.
He handed the plate to Seth, filled his cup and disappeared back in the tent to retrieve his own.
Jeb came back out, eating and talking while he walked over to Seth, "Hurry up now, we gotta get down the hill."
Seth was getting more and more nervous about the impending confrontation.
"I don't want to, like, walk right up to these guys."
Jeb just nodded and put his plate down by the fire.
"Get your rifle, boy, we don't need the horses this mornin'.
We're goin' back down to the meadow and it's only a couple of miles."
*                      *                      *
As Jeb was striding down the trail toward the meadow, with Seth struggling to keep up, he suddenly stopped and turned to face Seth.
"From here on, there'll be no more talkin' unless absolutely necessary.
Even then, keep it to a whisper!"
Before Seth could catch his breath or respond, Jeb had turned and was back on his way.
Eventually, they stood in the trees surveying the meadow where they had practiced shooting the day before.
All was quiet as they carefully skirted the meadow, purposefully staying in the trees.
It was still pretty dark but Jeb insured that, when the sun did rise, it would be at his back.
When he finally got to the position he wanted with a clear view of the trail across the meadow, he backed into the trees about ten yards and began to set up behind a fallen log, motioning for Seth to get over beside him.
He chambered a round, leaned the Seko against the log and whispered to Seth.
"OK, the sun, when it gets high enough, will be at our backs.
When they come into the meadow with the sun in their eyes, they won't be able to see into these trees.
The range'll be 'bout 200 yards.
Perfect!"
"Man, this is crazy!
You think they're just gonna leave?"
"Probably not but, if we don't give 'em the chance to, we're no better than they are.
Remember, these guys are killers!
Now, be quiet and wait!"
To Seth's surprise, Jeb turned around, sat down and leaned back against the log, pulling his hat down over his face as if to take a nap.
Seth had his Winchester at the ready and peered nervously over the log deciding that somebody had to keep his eyes open.
Just as Seth was beginning to nod off, Jeb suddenly rolled over, grabbed his rifle and positioned it on the log.
He whispered to Seth, "They're comin'!"
"I don't see anything."
"I don't see 'em either, I hear 'em!
Now, keep your head down and your mouth shut!"
Seth gave Jeb the roll-your-eyes, I think you're crazy look and scooted down so he could barely see over the top of the log.
Jeb cranked his scope to nine-power, put the rifle to his shoulder, clicked off the safety and trained it on the place he knew the trail broke into the meadow.
A minute later, a rider emerged from the trees, then another and another.
Jeb identified the lead rider as his neighbor, John Hawkins.
He did not recognize the other two riders but assumed that they were the same two that J.T. had warned him about.
During his appraisal of the situation, Jeb noted that Hawkins had no weapon visible but the second rider, Jake, had an assault rifle slung over his shoulder in such a way that he could raise it quickly to shoot.
The third man, Bull, had a rifle of some kind but tucked in a scabbard hanging on the side of his saddle, handy but still requiring a couple of seconds to access.
The number two rider was definitely the immediate threat and Jeb trained his rifle on him.
When the trio had cleared the tree line by fifty yards, Jeb hollered out, "John Hawkins, this is Jeb Grissom!
Why are you tracking me?"
John did not answer but looked nervously back and forth between the other riders and the trees.
Jake turned abruptly in the saddle and unleashed a barrage of fire from the assault rifle in the general direction of the voice.
In less than the beat of a heart, Jeb squeezed the trigger and the Seko roared a deafening response.
Jake was catapulted from his mount with a bullet through the heart.
Thinking his muzzle flash may have betrayed their position, Jeb knew he could not allow the other man to get off a shot.
Bull was in Jeb's crosshairs before his rifle cleared the scabbard and Jeb allowed him a second to reconsider his actions.
He did not.
Jeb's Seko roared again and it was over.
Before Bull's lifeless body hit the ground, John Hawkins threw his hands in the air and started yelling.
"Don't shoot, Jeb, don't shoot!
I'm not part of this, I swear!"
Jeb and Seth stood up and began to walk toward the remaining rider.
As they got closer, Jeb slung his rifle over his shoulder and instead, pulled his long-barreled .45 from the holster on his hip.
When they got up to John, Jeb pointed the pistol at his head and put his finger across his lips indicating John should remain silent.
Without looking away from John, Jeb barked an order.
"Seth, chamber a cartridge."
Seth shoved the lever on the thirty-thirty down and then slammed it shut.
A cartridge was chambered and the rifle was automatically cocked.
Seth raised it to his shoulder and drew a bead on the terrified rider.
Jeb continued, "Now, keep your eyes trained on him while I check the other two.
If he even blinks, shoot him!"
Seth began to tremble as he aimed a loaded gun at another human for the first time and that made John even more nervous.
Jeb walked over, first to Jake and then to Bull, keeping his revolver trained on each in turn.
He determined both men were dead, holstered his weapon and walked back to John who couldn't stand it anymore and began a rapid-fire jabber.
"Jeb, they forced me to guide them, I swear.
That big one kept his hand on that damned Uzi the whole time.
I had no choice.
I knew you could handle 'em.
Christ, Jeb, you gotta believe me.
I don't even have a gun.
They wouldn't let me."
Jeb stared at his neighbor for a long few seconds remembering how he never really liked the prick in the first place, thought he was an egotistical blowhard.
He was enjoying seeing him squirm in the saddle about to pee his pants.
Finally, "I 'spect you're tellin' the truth, John, but at this point, I really can't afford to trust you any more than they could.
So, get down here and help me get these guys on their horses."
Jeb turned to notice his trembling young guard, " Seth, I want you to slowly turn away and very carefully uncock that rifle."
Seth complied and John heaved a sigh of relief as he began to dismount.
Jeb continued, "Now, while we take care of the bodies, you collect their weapons and any ammo you can find."
