The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).

INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'

This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            A <strong>word-cloud representation</strong> is a group of words that a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            The words in the word cloud <strong>do NOT necessarily occur</strong> in the story snippet. 
            These words can just be relevant or semantically similar. <br/><br/>

            A <strong>word-cloud representation with nouns</strong> is a group of nouns a computer automatically 
            generated to characterize a story snippet. 
            These nouns can either be in the story snippet or be somewhat relevant.<br/><br/>

            In this HIT, you will see a story snippet. <span class="highlight">Please read it carefully.</span>
            The story is long so we have a <span class="highlight">3 minutes time lock</span> for submission.
            <br/><br/>

            At the bottom of the HIT, you will see three sets of word-cloud representations,

"Guy told me the same thing."
"I don't want to be fluff to you, I want a legal and valid marriage to you."
"Let's speak to Neo first.
If he keeps quiet, and we keep quiet..."
"I want him out of your life, I don't want him popping up whenever he pleases, claiming you.
You're with me, and only me, just as I'm with you, and only you.
Get your lawyer to draw up the divorce papers.
We'll meet Neo, and he'll sign them, or..."
panted Daniel.
Martha kissed him gently.
Guy phoned Martha to tell her that Neo would meet her the following evening.
He arrived late at the rendezvous point, and greeted everyone as if he had not kept them waiting.
Martha kept a hold on Daniel's hand to calm him, he was furious.
Guy told Neo that he had to divorce Martha.
"I was never married to her," he said.
"Neo..."
said Guy.
"My name is Alfred."
"We all know you're Neo.
We've had three separate investigators look into you, you're Neo," said Hutchins.
Neo looked at Martha malevolently.
"Why did you have to recognise me?
Why couldn't you have been like everyone else?"
he demanded.
"Why did you leave me with a stranger?"
she asked.
"You bored me."
Daniel gasped.
"You could have divorced me.
It would have been cheaper than a face lift," said Martha.
"True, but I wanted to be someone else more than I wanted to be divorced."
"I don't understand."
"I got tired of being Neo the engineer, with the parents I had, and the brother I had.
I wanted a life lived alone, with no wife, or other family crowding me.
I met Alfred in Cape Town.
He was alone in the world and wanted a family.
We decided to swap lives."
"You could have done that without endangering Martha by leaving her with a stranger," said Daniel.
"He loved you, Dan.
I found you suffocating, he saw you as the father he never had.
Didn't you become closer in the past few years?"
"Yes."
"It was Fred, not me.
Martha, he found you as uptight as I did, that's why he had extracurricular activities."
"If I was that boring, why did you marry me?"
"I wanted to marry out of my league, and you were that, Martha, way out of my league, with your almost royal ancestry, and the wealth you were born into, and inherited.
The social stuff I could handle.
But you were so needy, with your hugs and kisses.
It was enough to drive a man to hang himself."
"Why did you never tell me to stop?"
"It was novel for a while, and once it got boring, I didn't care enough to tell you that you bored me."
Martha nodded, then she smiled.
"Are you alright?"
asked Daniel.
"I can't believe I never saw Neo for who and what he is," she said.
"I was always thankful for that.
If you'd seen me for myself, instead of who you wanted, you'd never have married me," said Neo.
"Enough chitchat, sign the divorce papers," said Daniel.
"I'm signing nothing, timer."
Daniel leapt out of his chair and choked Neo.
Everyone gasped, and stood.
Guy and Hutchins tried to prise Daniel off Neo, and failed.
Martha stood behind Neo and put her hands on his choker's face.
"Daniel, Daniel, please don't kill him.
I want you home with me, not in prison," she said.
He did not seem to hear her.
She kissed him, and she was relieved to feel his hands on her forearms as he returned her kisses.
"I can't breathe," said a muffled voice.
Martha realised that Neo was squashed between her and Daniel.
She moved to Daniel's side and drew him away from Neo.
She could hear Daniel, Neo and herself panting.
"Sign the divorce papers, Neo, or I'll have you arrested for impersonation.
With all the evidence I have, you won't see the light of day any time soon, especially considering all the insurance fraud you're involved in," said Daniel.
Neo looked at him with hatred.
"Where am I supposed to sign?
On the air?"
he demanded.
Guy presented him with the papers, which he signed without reading.
"Look them over, Laurens," said Daniel.
Guy looked the papers over.
"Everything is in order," he said.
"Neo, get out of here, and stay away from my wife.
If you come near her..."
said Daniel.
"You'd better go," said Hutchins.
Neo gave Martha a last look, and left.
Daniel followed him.
"I was right," said Guy.
"About what?"
asked Martha.
"That man would kill for you."
"You noticed that too?"
said Hutchins.
"First time I saw them together."
"Me too."
"What reasons are given for my divorce from Neo?"
asked Martha.
"Abandonment and irreconcilable differences," said Guy.
"Daniel will see to it that the divorce is processed soon, he wants you married to him," said Hutchins.
Martha nodded.
Daniel returned.
"Are you alright, Martha?"
he asked.
"Yes."
"Victor just reunited with his brother."
"When?
How?"
"I told him to come here, then I hurt Neo into admitting the truth to him."
"Oh.
Was that wise?"
"Yes, that way, Victor spills his anger on his brother, not on you.
You've had enough pain from that family.
Let's go home," he said, taking her hand.
He made gentle love to her, that left her crying, touched deeply, physically and emotionally.
He held her tight all night, and they both called in sick the following day.
They spent most of the day in bed, making love or watching movies, or playing games.
Next morning at breakfast, Daniel gave Martha a long look.
"What is it?"
she asked.
"Are you alright?"
"Yes."
"Neo's words didn't upset you?"
"Not as much as they would have done if you hadn't been with me."
"Do you want to talk about Neo?"
"No.
Do you?"
"No.
I have to get to work.
Have a good day," said Daniel, then he kissed Martha, and left.
She called in sick, and went to see Dimpho.
Dimpho held her tight.
"Thank you, for the food, the nanny and the nurse before her," she said.
"You already thanked me."
"I want to be sure you know I appreciate you."
"I do.
How are you?
I hope you're getting enough rest.
You need to get back to work soon."
"Victor suggested I stay home for a year."
"No." "Martha!"
"Victor has problems, you need to have your own source of income."
"Why do you say that?"
"I'm buying food for your family, the family needs another source of income."
"You're right."
"I don't believe in secrets between couples, but I don't think Victor needs to know that I was here."
"I wasn't going to mention it.
He gets upset when he hears your name, and all because you make my life easier."
"I have to go."
"Thanks for coming by."
"Tell me if you need help, with anything."
