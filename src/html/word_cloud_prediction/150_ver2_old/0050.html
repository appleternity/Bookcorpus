That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

In the case of events, fame entails a large number of people being aware of the event's occurence; in the case of concrete entities, including humans, fame entails awareness of existence. In both cases, often fame is accompanied by awareness of the Entity's significance in historical, cultural, or social contexts.

Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.' 'Unless you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.'

The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.

CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   \'\' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    \'She threw her shoes into the dryer .\' \'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .\' \'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .\' \'\' \'\'  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): \'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI\' \'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .\' \'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI\' \'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .\' \'\'  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone\'s intentions as changing their location: \'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .\' \'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .\' \'\'  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): \'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .\' \'\'  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: \'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years\' \'One can not press this argument too far .\' \'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .\' \'She flung him a savage little smile .\' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. \'\' \'\'  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme\'s position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): \'\'  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. \'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.\' \'\'  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). \'John filled the box with old toys.\' \'\'  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). \'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.\' \'\'  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. \'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .\' \'\'  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Katie dropped to her knees and crawled through the broken window, feeling the glass scrape her imaginary knees and elbows and distantly wishing she would bleed from those wounds.
Knowing she could be hurt and never really feel the effects should have gladdened her - made her as giddy as a goat, Mom used to say.
Instead, it depressed the crap out of her.
Made her feel less real.
I'm not a real girl.
Where the car had rolled and some flying debris or other had caved in the roof and half of the driver's side, Katie found herself looking at an impossibly dented sheet of steel.
A scrap of gold muslin waved beneath it and she knew, just knew, that the person she had to find was on the other side.
How to get there though?
Well, she was a ghost, right?
And ghosts could walk through walls, right?
Maybe the hospital had just been a fluke.
That paranoid part of Katie made her wonder if that was all a myth and she would just end up knocking herself out or something.
Shrugging, Katie decided she had to try.
Nobody deserved to die alone.
As a test, she pressed her hand to the metal and felt it slide through.
It met a bit of resistance but hell... floating through sheet steel hardly sounded easy!
Katie wiggled her fingers, feeling the tickle of air and ripped material and almost pausing to revel in another new ability, and pulled her hand back.
It was fine.
And it felt ... odd.
Like it wasn't hers any longer.
Blinking away tears she finally felt as though she could cry, Katie placed it.
Her hand, at the very least, felt as though it belonged to an actual phantom and not just a dead girl whose brain did not know it yet.
"Hang in there just a little longer.
I'm Katie and I'm on my way.
Don't freak, okay?"
And that was all the warning she had time for because that invisible force pulled Katie forward until she had passed through the former roof and found herself staring down at a familiar face.
Gold and green on top; white roses in her hair; eyes of silver and gold all at once.
"Mademoiselle Romani."
She hunkered down and saw something flicker behind her eyes.
The shadows seen far too often on the faces of her friends.
Mademoiselle Romani was a psychic and she knew things before they happened.
And she never told what she saw if it couldn't be changed.
She knew something she couldn't change, and she was not going to tell Katie what it was.
"It's okay.
I know what you're thinking."
Metallic eyes focused and then swam away, focused again.
Breathing was getting hard - and it wasn't just the slowly deflating airbag crushing her ribs or the half a steering column piecing her chest right through.
"Sometimes people have to stay dead."
Mademoiselle Romani smiled and left a few pictures in Katie's head before her features dissolved into the altogether plainer ones of the woman who had been driving.
Apparently Mademoiselle Romani could see the past as well as the future.
No time to think about that now.
The woman slumped between the driver and passenger seats was clearly in tremendous pain; she was the priority.
"Can you hear me?"
Half-lidded eyes, green and brown powder all smudged, searched for the voice, strangely able to hear but not see Katie.
She didn't bother to question why or how this bizarre situation was happening.
All that mattered was that she had some way of communicating with the woman.
"Breathe, okay."
To her credit, the woman tried to slow her panicked breathing, but the frantic, shallow breaths were making so much movement that a lung could easily tear.
"Please," she rasped.
"No."
"No.
No what?"
The first thing that came to mind was that the woman just didn't want to die.
Who did?
Katie found a gap between pieces of the splintered dashboard.
"You're going to be okay."
It wasn't a lie but it felt like one.
As always, Katie felt guilty about it, about allowing another person to believe in something false.
But the woman needed it.
She had to trust things were working to save her.
She had to trust she was not a lost cause.
"I'm not going to hurt you."
"Where..?"
"I'm right next to you."
A pink-haired good luck troll dangled, lop-sided and way too smiley, from the bent rearview mirror.
She instructed the woman to look in the shards of looking glass still left in the frame.
For some reason Katie had a reflection.
Or it could have just been that the woman was touching death and could perceive a new dimension to the world through it.
Her eyes flew wide and the breathing got panicky once more.
She instinctively flinched away from Katie, a devastating mix of confusion and terror tensing her body, making her heart pound like a butterfly in a tiny iron cage.
What if the metal shifted and perforated her heart?  "de Rossa would know what to do," Katie murmured.
Even Lainy or Chris would have a better idea than her.
Lainy might have mainly treated minor injuries in her years as a nurse but surely they covered gross chest trauma in training.
And Chris was a paramedic and used to patching people up on the fly - maybe even people in worse states than this.
Dr de Rossa, a nurse and a paramedic who'd risked his life for her, and she'd left them all behind.
They should be here - not her.
"Try not to move.
That's kind of a stupid thing to say, huh?
I mean, where are you going to go?
Did I think you were going to get up and dance the Hokey Cokey?
I'm an idiot."
A gasp of laughter sawed the air.
"I... like you... remind me... name?
"I'm Katie Cartwright.
I'm going to stay right here until-" Suddenly, the woman sniffed at the air and frowned.
"Smell."
"Do I?"
"No.
Not... you.
Outside."
Katie opened her mouth to protest - she couldn't smell a thing - but then it flooded her nostrils like it had been there all along.
All these long minutes and all around her.
She hadn't even noticed.
Maybe she was learning, on some level, to turn off all unpleasant feelings and senses.
But this sudden stink was as offensive as they came...
"Holy shit.
I have to go."
...Petrol.
In the space of a few seconds, Katie had braced herself for that deep nausea and fought it back as she faded through the grotesquely twisted roof, listened with pin sharp hearing for the steady drip drip drip of a fuel leak and traced it back to the car she had just left.
"Petrol leak!"
she shouted, waving her arms around.
She was roundly ignored.
Had she really expected anything else?
Just 'cos one dying woman saw me, I'm suddenly thinking the whole world knows I'm here.
That makes perfect sense.
So what could she do?
She couldn't even alert the rescue workers to the car wreck they appeared to have missed.
And even if they did notice at some point they almost certainly wouldn't catch the petrol leak in time.
Nor would they probably smell it under smouldering rubber and the exhaust of ambulances revving and racing away.
Petrol smelled much the same as liquid or gas.
Marcie would know what to do now - she might even be able to use her mechanic skills to somehow plug the leak until it was safe.
Was that even possible?
Redundant question really.
There was already acid-smelling liquid all over the ground.
A hundred cars backed up on all four lanes behind her - about half with their engines still running in the vain hope everything would magically clear away to let them past.
A rescue team was still busy chopping vehicles open with industrial strength cutters.
One spark...
Just one errant bolt of metallic heat...
It was scary to think that it took such a tiny amount of energy to set the whole thing alight.
And right at the heart of the explosion would be a woman with a probably fatal chest wound whose name she didn't even know.
"Anybody!
Can anyone hear me?!"
It was worth one more shot.
"Please!
You can't..."
Katie tried to shout around a sudden lump in her throat.
A handful of metres away, a woman was clinging to life by her fingernails.
A woman who was going to die anyway.
From blood loss, yes.
A collapsed lung, I can deal with.
But if that petrol tank goes up...
I can't let her be blown up.
So, why wasn't she doing anything?
Katie looked at the car wreck behind her with stinging tears blurring her vision and knew with cold certainty that it was too late.
Whatever she did now, it was going to be too late for her.
It wouldn't be too late for everyone else though.
She could still protect everyone else; accelerant based explosions weren't fussy about who they hurt.
The innocent motorists and their passengers, the real-life angels who were trying to save everyone today... she could save them all herself.
And they will never even know.
But how?
How could she get them to pay attention?
Think, think, think.
She was battering at the puzzle and wandering past men and women in hi-vis suits when it came to her.
She stopped beside a man who seemed to be in charge of the fire crew - he was barking orders at his team and they were obeying.
It might not even work.
Theory was telling Katie that if she could drift through steel and glass she should be able to go through flesh and bone.
If she stopped moving midway, in the middle of the body, she could possess it - control what it said and did.
Just until she was finished.
Going through the idea more slowly, it sounded increasingly insane.
It was beyond the section me now stage and well into fetch me a strait jacket.
