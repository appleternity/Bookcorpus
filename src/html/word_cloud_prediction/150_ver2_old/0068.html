In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

This frame contains verbs that participate in the ditransitive construction, with a recipient as the direct object, as in the following: 'I sent Bill the manuscript.' Certain Verbs in this Frame focus on the initial sending act, while others do not.  For example, I sent it rapidly can either mean the act of sending was initiated quickly or that it moved quickly.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). \'\' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically "impinging" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: \'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008\' \'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. \' \'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.\'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions (\'the hopelessness surrounding them\'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies (\'Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed\').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.'}, {'frame': 'Firing', 'tfidf': 0.6179295576208786, 'lexical_unit': 'dismiss.v / shitcan.v / discharge.v', 'definition': "An Employer ends an employment relationship with an Employee.

The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus "glinting", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a "hard cold" emotion like hatred, while "sparkling", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a "beautiful" emotion like amusement or excitement.

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses ("a STRONG person") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses ("a STRONG push"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   \'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.\'  \'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.\'  \'A powerful force tore off the tree\'s branches.\'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. \'\'  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: \'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.\' \'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.\'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: \'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.\' \'He was a forceful speaker.\'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  \'\'  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame\'s FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE\'s capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE\'s tendency. For example, "a STRONG person" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while "an ENERGETIC person" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - "a STRONG push" and "an ENERGETIC push" seem rather comparable.

Ranmaru thought sadly as he raised his sword.
Forgive me Nagi...
Kenmaru let out a battle cry as he swung his sword forward and unleashed the powerful Black Fire attack upon Ranmaru- Ranmaru let out a battle cry of his own and swung his own sword forward to unleash a red fiery attack- "Black Fire Attack!"
"Fire Blast Attack!"
The two attacks clashed in midair but it was just as Ranmaru had known all along.
The Black Fire pushed back on his attack and consumed it almost instantly.
And now the Black Fire attack was headed his way, ready to consume him.
Goodbye Nagi...I'm sorry I failed to protect you...
"Ranmaru!"
It was Nagi's beautiful melodious voice, which sounded like the temple bell from her village.
Ranmaru opened his eyes to see that Nagi was standing in front of him, and she was...glowing.
A beautiful, white-tinged aura of immense purity surrounded her body and she had her hand outstretched before her while using her power to shield Ranmaru and herself from the Black Fire!
His miko love was fighting to protect him!
Nagi...Ranmaru's heart clenched in his chest as he watched her.
She really was beautiful.
She was wearing her usual miko robes - a white haori shirt and red hakama pants.
She was the complete opposite of himself.
A fragile, dark, pale beauty.
Nagi was delicate, refined, with long silky black hair, small hands, peridot-colored eyes, and skin as pale and fragile as porcelain.
In fact she reminded him of a porcelain doll.
She had always looked like a single touch from him would cause her to shatter.
But he had always been very gentle with her for that reason...something he would never have done for anyone else...
Such incredible power!
Ranmaru couldn't help but be impressed by Nagi's display.
As the fire pushed against the shield Nagi had created, she struggled to use more of her power to keep the fire at bay and then managed to dispel the attack entirely with one final push of her power.
Nagi had conquered the Black Fire attack!
However, blood trickled out of the corner of her mouth.
Her body was trembling from the aftereffects of using such an immense amount of her power in one go, and she sunk to her knees from utter exhaustion.
"Nagi!"
Ranmaru rushed over to her side.
"Ranmaru..."
Nagi smiled weakly.
"I'm so glad you're safe."
Nagi's eyes flickered somewhere directly behind Ranmaru.
"Oh thank goodness.
It's gone..."
Upon seeing his miko love weakened and looking even frailer than usual Ranmaru became blinded by the sudden rush of hate he felt for Kenmaru.
"Nagi, do not worry.
I will make him pay for hurting you.
I will defeat Kenmaru.
And protect you."
Ranmaru stood and turned his attention back towards Kenmaru spotting him a ways away.
"Wait...don't go Ranmaru..."
Nagi reached out her hand to stop him, but he didn't hear her, so blinded by hate and rage was he.
"No...wait...please, there's something I need-" But her voice was too low, too weak, for Ranmaru to hear, and her hand fell when she realized that she would not be able to reach him in his current state.
She watched Ranmaru raise his sword and charge Kenmaru and willed her eyes to stay open so that she could watch the rest, but her eyelids felt heavy and she fell forward onto the ground collapsing in a faint, her energy finally leaving her.
Kenmaru was in bad shape and coughed up a large amount of blood, which dribbled down his chin, and stained the ground in front of him.
The Black Fire had destroyed and damaged several of his internal organs, and until they regenerated he could not use the Black Fire again without causing his immediate death.
He turned to see that Ranmaru was completely unharmed, and had transformed into his nine-tailed fox form due to being consumed by his bloodlust and losing what was left of his humanity.
"Stubborn bastard...let's end this..."
More blood trickled down his chin and he wiped it away with the back of his hand, a grim expression on his face as he smiled lopsidedly.
"I'll show him how much I've changed...that I don't need him to protect me anymore..."
Ranmaru growled fiercely revealing his sharp teeth, and placed one of his clawed paws in front of him as he prepared himself to attack.
Kenmaru transformed into his own two-tailed fox form - a fox that had snowy-white hair and pink eyes.
An albino fox.
He too mimicked Ranmaru and snarling while revealing his own long, sharp fangs moved one paw forward as he prepared to attack his foe.
They stood off like this - facing each other - appraising their enemy.
And then the two foxes rushed at each other, using their yokai speed and power, and they attacked each other leaping up into the air and slamming into each other.
As their speed increased to the naked eye they became nothing more than two bright lights slamming into each other in the air - like two angry fireworks, sparking and exploding as they collided.
The air was filled with the powerful shockwaves from the force of the attacks that they were using on each other and the ground around them began to explode and crumble...
Finally, Ranmaru and Kenmaru passed each other as both of them used their final and most deadly attacks, putting an end to their fierce battle.
Blood spurted out from a wound on Ranmaru's shoulder and he turned to face Kenmaru.
Kenmaru leered victoriously revealing his white teeth, and was seemingly unharmed before he frowned suddenly and collapsed - blood spraying into the air from a deadly wound on his neck.
Ranmaru leapt onto Kenmaru's prone body, still in his fox form, and was prepared to rip his throat out when- An amused, trilling laughter filled the air.
Ranmaru recognized that laugh.
It was her.
He turned to see Nagi's twin sister and the sight of Nagi with that twisted smile on her face caused him to shiver.
Kagura was standing not too far away from him, with a pleased expression on her face.
There was also this cat that ate the canary smile upon her blood-red painted lips.
She was hiding something...Ranmaru realized.
Kagura was twirling a single leaf in her hand, a fox magic talisman that Kenmaru had gifted her with in order for her to be able to transform into the mirror image of Nagi.
This would have been so that Kagura could have approached Ranmaru while pretending to be her sister, but now that her sister was dead the spell Kenmaru had gifted her with was no longer needed.
A pity.
Kagura tossed the leaf away and approached Ranmaru.
"Darling Ranmaru..."
She purred, "I see you've won your little battle.
Did you have fun?
I bet you did.
I know how much you love to fight.
Love the heat of battle - that feeling of not knowing whether or not you'll live or die.
It's orgasmic isn't it?
A warrior, no a beast, like you doesn't feel truly alive unless he is in the midst of a battle to the death.
You love fighting more than anything Ranmaru, do you not?
Apparently even more than my very own sister..."
Ranmaru's eyes widened as he suddenly remembered about Nagi.
Where was she?
His eyes frantically searched the scorched battlefield in search of her.
And then he caught sight of her - There!
Lying face first on the ground was the prone, bloody, broken, and unmoving form of his miko love. Nagi...
There, lying in a pool of her own blood...
--Nagi!
Ranmaru quickly transformed back into his human form and rushed towards her, "Nagi!"
He bent over her and took her limp body protectively into his arms and looked down into her lifeless face.
"Nagi?
Nagi!
Speak to me!
Wake up Nagi!
Open your eyes!"
He began to shake her vigorously, her head snapped back and forth in a chilling manner.
Ranmaru looked down at her shocked, eyes full of disbelief.
Her eyes weren't opening...This can't be happening...
"She won't wake."
Kagura began in a singsong voice, "And do you want to know why?
Because she'd dead!
You killed her Ranmaru!"
She burst out, her voice taking on a sudden hateful and angry tinge.
But then her tone suddenly turned mocking.
"Just kidding, like I care!"
"No..."
Ranmaru shook his head and murmured to himself.
No...it can't be.
I didn't...no...
"You knew my sister was weak, sickly, and yet you used your full yokai power while in her presence and this is what has killed her.
Foolish yokai beast."
She sneered.
"You really are so pathetic.
You couldn't even protect the woman you loved.
All you know how to do, all you're good at is - killing."
Kagura's words were like knives.
Ranmaru shook his head, "No...no...no...NAGI!"
He raised his head and looked up at the sky in despair and howled while he clutched her broken body to his chest, tears were streaming down his face.
Tears that hadn't fallen for centuries.
"I didn't mean to...my love..."
Kagura came up behind Ranmaru, "Yes, you did.
After all, you're just a beast that loves fighting.
A tool for killing.
But perhaps in that respect you could become useful to me somehow.
There are so many who stand in my way.
And I can have you get rid of them for me.
And so you shall become mine!"
Kagura reached down and placed the enchanted Control Collar that Kenmaru had gifted her with around Ranmaru's neck.
"Embrace."
She spoke the word of subjugation, the word of 'punishment', just to try it out and make sure that Ranmaru was truly in her clutches now.
Ranmaru cried out in pain as the collar constricted tightly around his neck and sent painful electric shocks coursing through his body.
"That's for killing my sister, darling Ranmaru."
An evil and triumphant smile formed on Kagura's face.
"I'm going to have fun breaking you as punishment for loving my sister.
I wonder how many centuries that will take...No matter, I'm immortal now too."
She laughed gleefully.
Ranmaru hung his head. This...this is only what I deserve...
END OF FLASHBACK...
"What I fight for...?"
Flashes of memories he had long tried to bury and repress had begun to surface within his mind.
And he had begun to remember bits and pieces of how he had failed to protect his miko love...how he had caused her death.
He suddenly felt like throwing up.
"You do have someone to protect, Ranmaru.
Don't lose sight of what's important.
This will sound funny for a robot to be saying but don't lose sight of your sense of self.
You aren't just a warrior.
You unlike me, truly have a heart.
