        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <h4>Story 1</h4>
                    <pre>"You tried to kill me while I was sleeping but more importantly, you abandoned Thirteen."
"You have named my Kumovon child already.
I guess he cannot keep the name I had given him since he is no longer mine, and you have no right to criticize me about the care of my children," Shukujo told her.
"You are in the Mortem, you should expect anyone of the Residents to try to kill you at any time, so do not chastise me for seeing an opportunity and snatching it.
Now tell me where you acquired such a thing to sever the link that is between me and my child."
"I didn't sever your link.
It's still there.
I've learned to always be on my guard so that I don't cut any threads between those of family and anyway, I'm not talking to you," Kein told her as she pouted.
"Go away.
I have to think."
"What is there to think about?
You are going to die here and most likely by my hands and fangs."
"I need to find the Atlantean a book he has never read," Kein told her.
"The problem is that I heard he is very old, older than King Ammon, so he has read a lot of books.
I could find him a very rare book but there's still no guarantee that he hasn't read it."
She glanced at her backpack as she added, "I do have one very rare book, but I don't want to ever part with it.
I'm still learning from it."
"Why not tell him the story of your soon to be short boring life?"
Shukujo said, mocking her.
"Tell him my story?"
Kein said as she sat up.
"That's not a bad idea.
Thank you.
Thank you, Shukujo."
"Why are you thanking me?"
"Your idea is good," Kein told her.
"And I don't think I would have ever thought of it on my own."
"Do not thank me.
I did not intend to be helpful.
Never thank me...
Actually, I take my idea back.
You cannot use it."
"Too late," Kein spoke excitedly as a little light trickled into the hopelessness she had.
"The idea has been planted, and I'm going to run with it.
Thanks again."
"Do not thank me!
Never thank me, baka!"
Kein set Thirteen on the floor and quickly left, heading to Dr. Jekyll's room.
Sometime later...
Kein left Dr. Jekyll's lab and went to the Atlantean's swamp, and then she called out, "I'm back!"
He soon appeared out of the water and moved to the dock below the twenty-foot one.
"Mi cha, do you remember my warning?"
he questioned her.
"I do," she replied.
"That is why I brought you a one of a kind story that has never been published."
Kein tossed some papers that had been stapled together, and he caught them and flipped through them.
"Did you make this?"
"I did.
I also wrote it.
Dr.
Jekyll said I could use some of his office supplies."
"I see that you have all of your appendages," the Atlantean started.
"What did you have to trade to acquire these?"
"Nothing.
I just waited till he was really really busy and asked him if I could have some of his supplies.
He waved me away, so I took it as I could have them.
I'm not sure he even knew I was in the lab."
"He can get that way when he is working," the Atlantean told her, and then he looked at her crude book and read its title, "The Kumovon And The Little Girl."
He peered up from the book and said, "Is it a fairytale?"
"No, a true story.
I was never one to make up things, so all I could write about was what happened to me.
Does it meet your requirements?"
"Allow me to read it, and then I will tell you if your life is yours for a few minutes more."
The Atlantean sat where he stood, and Kein waited while he read through the book and after some time, he closed the book and stood.
"What did you think?"
she asked.
"It meets the requirements of a book I have never read, so I will acquire the Waters of Life that you requested."
"What did you think of the story?"
"The book's binding was put together in haste.
The drawings within it were crude, but they were drawn with care and love.
I also thought-" "You can tell that just by reading it?"
Kein interrupted.
"No, I can get a sense of things when I touch objects.
I can tell if someone is telling the truth through the air, but I have to make physical contact with a person or object to get a sense of things," he answered, and then he said, "The story's style is as if a child wrote it.
Was that intentional?"
"No, I don't think so.
My writing is still...
I need more practice."
"I do like the story.
It is... what is the word I am looking for.
It is endearing, and you say it is all true?"
"Yes," Kein replied.
"Why did the Kumovon not devour you?"
"I upset her," Kein replied.
"I did something very wrong, so she didn't devour me."
"I do not think you understand my question," the Atlantean stated.
"At any time, the Kumovon could have eaten you and left the cavern.
Human flesh is very nourishing so no matter how small you were, she could have eaten you, healed any injury she might have had, and left at any time."
"Eat...
Devour..."
Kein spoke softly.
"I thought they had different meanings.
I didn't realize back then that they meant the same thing.
I think I took her wanting to devour me as..."
She paused and then said, "Clans and houses devour those who they want to bring into their family and so as a lonely child, I thought she wanted me as her own."
"The book you wrote actually gave me my answer," he told her.
"I just wanted to know if you had accepted the truth yet.
You must have been a very lonely and desperate child if you wanted a Kumovon to devour you."
Kein thought fondly of those seven months with the lady as she said, "I was lonely but..."
She placed her right palm on her chest over her heart, and then she made a fist as if grasping her heart and said, "I also really cared about her and at the time, I thought she cared about me."
Kein dropped her hand to her side as she continued, "I now doubt the feelings I thought she had towards me.
I believed with all my being that when she was better she would take me with her, but the lady abandoned me.
She left without saying goodbye."
The Atlantean spoke, "I still do not believe you realize the extreme danger you were in.
The Kumovon wanted to slice you open and eat your intestines, and yet you treated her as a dear teacher, no... more than that.
You treated the Kumovon lady as if she was your birth mother.
You are not Kumovon, but you were a very confused little girl."
The words he spoke had a power to them, almost as if he touched her very soul with them and brought the memories dear and tragic to life in a way that rampaged through her defenses, and it allowed uncontrollable tears to stream down her face as she said, "I know...
The more I'm here the more I realize that."
She wiped the tears away as she said, "Why would she want me to be part of her family?
I was just something to pass the time.
I was just food to her.
I was a way to escape her prison.
I was just..."
"I see I have touched on something sensitive," the Atlantean spoke, and then he said, "I am sorry.
My intentions were not to make you cry."
"It is fine.
I have already stopped crying," Kein told him.
"You have fulfilled your part of the bargain, so I will go now and acquire the Waters of Life in the vessel you left.
It will take me some time.
Return after the witching hour, and I should have it by then."
The Atlantean went and stored the book Kein had written in one of many wooden chests that lined the docks, and then he went, grabbed the vessel, and returned to the swamp water.
Kein watched as he went,  and then she went and sat on the end of the dock and since she was alone, Kein wept bitterly into her palms.
Elsewhere...
Controller's room...
"The Atlantean has made the human cry," Blue Wolf spoke up.
"My Resident has earned quite a bit of points for himself."
"He has also earned you a lot of money from the Emotional Fund," Controller told her.
"What is this Emotional Fund?"
Yellow Dragon questioned.
"It is an endless pool of money that pays out to Coaches in money and to Residents in points when certain criteria are fulfilled."
"I understand," Yellow Dragon said.
"One of the criteria must be to make a participant cry.
What other criteria are part of this Emotional Fund?"
"There are many," Controller told him.
"Examples are laughing for joy; it is rare and one of the highest payouts and there is also screaming in rage or anger, but it is one of the lowest payouts.
This particular fund has blind criteria so only after they have been met and paid are they known."
"I understand," Yellow Dragon stated.
"Would any of the Coaches like to strike a bargain with me?
I will pay to know what other criteria are known by them for the Emotional Fund."
"I will take you up on your deal," Blue Wolf spoke up.
"You are nearly as new as me," Yellow Dragon said.
"I would prefer to see if one of the other Coaches will take my offer."
Green Serpent said, "I will if the reward is worth my time."
"Here is what I will pay for each blind criterion that is known to you," Yellow Dragon stated as he sent the amount to Green Serpent.
Green Serpent looked over the amount and said, "A bargain has been struck."
"A bargain has been struck," Yellow Dragon replied even though he had already said it.
The two Coaches switched to a restricted feed that only the two of them could communicate on.
Yellow Dragon said, "Tell me what you know."
"I know of three blind criteria for the Emotional Fund," Green Serpent began.
"Someone reveals a secret to another, and both the one telling the secret and the one hearing the secret earn points and their Coaches earn money.
The second is a reunion takes place in the Mortem.
The more joyous the more reward.
The third thing is a wrong is revealed between two participants.
Either someone informs the others through the Inquisition Seat or a confession is made.
Those are the blind criteria that I-" Yellow Dragon interrupted, "I know what the Inquisition Seat within the Judicium is, but I thought it was against the rules of the Mortem to... how should I put it?
It is against the rules of the Mortem to reveal anything about a participant that is not revealed in the Mortem."
"You're correct about that," Green Serpent stated.
"But there are also exceptions to that rule."
He paused and said, "We should return so not to miss too much."
They disengaged their restricted feed.
"Good, the two of you are back," Controller spoke.
"Let us go around and see if anyone would like to make any new wagers."
"I would like to wager that my Resident the Kumovon will kill the human by the end of this day," Green Serpent spoke.
"I will take that wager," Red Phoenix stated.
"I wager this human will last at least four days among the Residents."
"I will take that wager," Purple Rose said.
"I believe the human is too kindhearted to survive within the Mortem, so I would like to add something to our wager."
Red Phoenix said, "I will hear you out."
"I not only believe this human will perish, but I wager she will perish in a very painful way that will last several hours."
"What a terrible thing to say?"
Blue Wolf spoke up.
"Are you wishing this poor human ill-will?"
"I have no feelings either way towards this human," Purple Rose replied.
"I am merely forecasting her inevitable end."
"I would like in on this wager," Green Serpent spoke.
"I would like to wager on the side of Purple Rose."
"I accept your joint wager," Purple Rose said.
"Would anyone else like to join in?"
"I'm still very new at this," Yellow Dragon stated.
"I think I'll step back and watch the outcome of this."
"What about you, Blue Wolf?"
Purple Rose questioned.
"I guess I can make it ladies versus gentleman, so I am in," she replied.
"I do like to root for the underdog.
I also see this kindness of hers.
I think it is a useful tool for her and has many ways that it can be used."
Controller spoke up, "Are there any other wagers at this time?"
He waited a few moments, and then he said, "There is not, so I call the wagering at an end for now."
Basement Level...
Kein finished her cry, dried her eyes, and moved on to King Ammon's room.
She wanted to update him on her progress and wanted to ask him her other question for the day.
She was in better spirits since crying.
Kein usually never let herself get to the point of breaking down but for some reason, she felt better after doing so.
She called out to King Ammon, but he never answered her so after about twenty minutes, she started through the tomb, calling out to him.
The Egyptian tomb passages were dark and in ruins, and Kein expected some creature or thing to spring out of the darkness at her and try to take a bite out of her, but none did.
She noticed light ahead, then the passage ended, and a large valley with a river flowing through it was on the other side of the tomb.
The place was gorgeous and full of life and light, and she stood there in awe of the sight and never heard King Ammon approach her from behind.
"It is a wondrous sight," he said in her mind.
Kein jumped with the intrusion to her thoughts, and then she spoke, "You startled me."</pre>

                    <pre>There was no way for her to control it.
"Well, parts of you were enjoying it.
The rest of you was rather upset about it.
I think that's why you were so grateful when I finally saved you."
He licked his lower lip, eyes half lidded.
"So incredibly grateful."
She shivered, his memories brushing against her, and she could feel his body against hers.
Her skin crawled with the feel of his hands, and she began moaning under her breath.
The vampire came closer, and the air practically filled with sparks as the distance between them shortened.
Her back arched, and she heard Rikter gasp as he watched her move.
"What are you talking about?"
she asked breathlessly.
Rikter closed the gap in a blur, trapping the girl against the wall with his presence, his arms braced on either side of her shoulders.
She could taste his musk, and the princess whimpered again.
The vampire drew a deep breath, his mouth near her neck, and Tayla watched his neck work as he swallowed deeply.
"You were so on edge, aroused, intoxicated, and you wanted me.
You threw yourself at me, and you begged me to take you."
His voice became a deep whisper, and her skin crawled pleasantly in reaction.
"I was so close to giving you what you wanted."
Tayla shook her head, a moment of clarity giving her a brief respite.
"No.
It is merely your desire I feel.
It makes me want you.
You are using it against me."
Rikter lowered his head, his mouth a hair's breadth from her shoulder, and she felt his lust trembling between them.
"Oh yes, I do desire you.
Any man would be a fool not to desire you.
And you tempt me.
You make me want to give in, to break my word."
He groaned, and she shuddered in response, her hands suddenly going to his waist.
"You tempt me like no woman ever has before."
Tayla shook as she fought to break free.
Her fingers traced the edges of his stomach, following the line up to his chest, and she sighed.
He moved his head, his breath washing across her neck, and his hunger surged, ripping a groan from her.
Her hands twitched, and her nails raked his pectorals.
"I do not want this," she whispered desperately.
He chuckled lowly, bending his mouth to hers.
"You kissed me after I rescued you.
Do you remember that?
Do your remember biting at my neck?"
His lips brushed hers, and she shivered.
"No," she whispered.
She bit her lip, turning her head from his questing mouth.
"No," she said with more strength, her hands pushing him away.
"No!"
she finally screamed, shoving at him, scratching his chest.
He stepped back, and she glared at him with tear filled eyes.
Tayla slapped at his chest, her hands flailing as frustration surged through her veins.
"I do not want you," she declared at the top of her lungs, her hands clenching to fists.
Her blows thudded on his solid chest, and he took another step backwards.
Tayla didn't see his hand move, but she was suddenly reeling back, her cheek stinging.
The princess turned back to him, eyes wide with shock, cupping a hand over her burning cheek.
She saw his shoulder twitch, and then his other hand was slamming into her exposed cheek.
Tayla cried out as she stumbled back, crashing into the wall.
Her knees buckled as stars danced before her eyes, and she slid to the floor in a heap.
She tried to mumble an apology, but it came out a scream as his boot lashed out.
The toe dug into her thigh, and she cringed away, instinctively covering her head.
Rikter's surge of anger hit her almost as hard as his fist, and the girl began crying.
Her thoughts were a blur of apologies, but she could speak none of them.
Even crawling away didn't save her, as the vampire followed Tayla across the floor.
She screamed as the heel of his boot stomped into the small of her back.
Her vision became a blur of white pain, and everything faded to the searing throb in her back.
Tayla thought she scrabbled at the floor, but there was no way to be sure.
Someone was keening pitifully, and it sounded like her.
Breathing became an impossibility, and the princess collapsed on the floor.
Her world remained distant, a part of her mind detached from the goings on.
Tayla was aware of Rikter suddenly stooping to her side, his voice concerned as he called her name.
She watched herself try to answer, saw him frowning.
Pain overwhelmed her momentarily as he pulled her into his arms, and she knew she started sobbing afresh.
The vampire held her in his arms, touching her leg and back, fingers probing tender flesh.
She kicked and screamed, trying to writhe away from him, but he held her firm.
Sighing with relief, he lifted her up, and carried her to her room.
The walk up the stairs was too much for her, and she blacked out momentarily, coming to as Rikter laid her in the bed, beginning to take her clothes off.
She moaned, stirring, attempting to help him, then winced in pain as something in her back spasmed.
Tayla panted helplessly as the vampire knelt beside her.
"Don't move, my little rose.
Just let me take care of you."
His voice was full of pain, and Tayla could feel his sorrow.
She let him undress her, watching with helpless eyes, pondering on his actions.
One moment he is beating me ruthlessly, the next he is practically crying over me.
I do not understand him.
Not entirely true.
I understand that he has only ever lifted a hand like this when I have attacked him.
All I need to do is control my own reactions, and not provoke him She cried out as he lifted her to a better position in the bed, pulling a sheet over her.
But can I learn to control my emotions?
Rikter knelt beside the bed, clasping her hand in his, and she saw the bloody tears standing in his eyes.
"I'll find something to dull the pain, my rose.
I'm so sorry I went this far.
Can you forgive me?"
"Of course I forgive you," she said quickly, without thinking.
She trembled as her body throbbed, and frowned at him, forcing more words past aching lips.
"I will forgive you if you can forgive my actions."
Rikter kissed her fingertips, and a tear fell down his angled cheek.
"Tayla, you have absolutely nothing for me to forgive."
He kissed the palm of her hand.
"I provoked you, and I let my fear get the better part of me."
"Fear?"
she asked, confused.
"I felt no fear, only anger."
He nodded, pressing his forehead against her hand.
"It's because I don't let anyone know about it," he whispered.
"I was angry.
Angry about more than just my plans getting mucked up.
I was frustrated that Starbeth interrupted us."
Tayla blushed, biting her swollen lip.
"I was angry at myself that I have been letting my emotions get the better part of me.
I thought I had burned it out of my system with my work out, but then..."
His voice trailed off, and the princess waited patiently.
He looked up, eyes haunted, and brushed his mouth across her fingers again.
"I felt your hunger.
I felt your attention.
I felt you shaking, was shaking myself with it, and I was angry at that."
"I did not mean-" He pressed a finger to her lips, cutting off her words.
"I know you didn't mean it.
I know you can't control it.
I already told you that.
But I was already on edge, and it irked me that I should feel something from an untrained girl.
I swore I would never let anyone force me to feel something I didn't want to.
When you tried to get me to back off, I just snapped."
He let the silence build, and she watched him carefully.
He pressed his head to her hand again, then began to rise.
"Do not leave me," she said swiftly, clutching at his hands.
She couldn't have said why she wanted him to stay, but she knew it had something to do with the anguish she felt inside him.
He smiled briefly, his eyes lighting up, and he squeezed her fingers.
"Let me get a servant then.
Get you something to eat, and something to dull the pain."
He bent down, running a hand through her hair.
"Would that be all right?"
She nodded, feeling like a little child, enjoying the attention.
He kissed her forehead, then walked from the room.
Tayla must have dozed, because the next thing she knew he was touching her shoulder, urging her to sit up.
A tray of food waited on the table beside her, and she allowed him to adjust her pillows until she was lounging in an upright position.
He settled next to her, balancing the tray across her legs.
"How bad do you feel?"
he asked, clasping his hands around on knee.
He had put on a shirt while he was gone, though it was not closed all the way.
His hair was damp, curling around his face.
It was hard for the girl to recall the way his mouth snarled when he was angry.
"I cannot rightly say," she said, snuggling back into the pillows.
"Everything hurts.
I want to cry."
He winced, turning his head away.
His hair shifted, curtaining his face, and she shivered with his anguish.
She reached for him, and he looked back at her when her fingers brushed his shoulder.
"Where is the pain killer?"
His smile as fleeting, his hand trembling faintly when he reached for her.
"You should not carry this burden alone."
Rikter closed his eyes, settling his hand on her collarbone, drawing a deep breath.
Tayla's breath caught in her throat as the vampire drew on her pain, numbing her to the tortured aches of her body.
There was some stiffness still, and a knowledge that she was wounded, but Rikter had taken most of it to himself.
The princess smiled shyly when his black eyes reopened, and was rewarded with a deeper smile from her captor.
She looked down at the food, a thick stew with flaky bread on the side, then back at the vampire.
"Tell me about what you fear," she said.
His eyes narrowed for a moment, and she felt his emotions suddenly cut off.
She sighed, not realizing how deeply she'd shared his pain.
He shook, and she watched his gaze shift, as if he looked at something far away.
"I told you that Alexisana finally revealed herself to me.
It was a bit of a shock, but I handled it well.
I didn't care, actually, because I was so in love with her.
It just made her that much more divine to me.
I told her she could do anything she wanted to me.
"She took it as whole hearted submission.
She let me taste her talents, showed me that she could share my sensations.
She used it to turn her little torture sessions into something blissful, despite the pain.
I begged for more, because it was headier than any drug I'd ever tried.
She kept testing my limits, leaving scars as signs of her love, and I endeavored to prove myself worthy for her.
"I was with her at one of her little parties when one of her male friends asked to use me.
I balked, and told her no, and she didn't like that."
Rikter paused, closing his eyes.
His voice was agonized when he next spoke, and Tayla reached a hand to grasp his.
"She gave me to her friend, and as he raped me, she forced her pleasure onto me.
I got sick, and I tried to fight it, but there was no stopping it.
It felt like it went on forever.
"When the party was done, I tried to lash out at her.
I tried to tell her I would never be a plaything for anyone to use, and we got in a fight.
She lashed out at me, and she broke my arm in three places, and then she had her way with me.
All the time she was using my body, she told me how delicious my pain was, even as she laced it with ecstasy."
"I dreamt of that," the princess whispered.
Rikter questioned her with a pain-filled gaze, and she licked her lips.
"The day after you killed Mardain, when I was sleeping in your arms...I dreamt of something just like that."
He shivered, turning his head away.
The air chilled with a taste of fear, and she bit her lip painfully.
She squeezed his hand, tugging it towards her, and the vampire looked back, frowning with his private pain.
"I was thinking about all the tortures that bitch inflicted on me," he whispered breathily.
"I had no idea it would leak into your dreams."
She smiled endearingly, wondering at her reaction, and pulled him closer.
"I have never slept in someone else's arms like that.
There was no knowing it was possible."
The vampire relented to her tugging, and let himself fall against her body.
The dishes clattered on the tray, and the princess slid it far from them before it spilled.
Wrapping herself around the baron, she felt his tension relax.
"It only got worse from there," he said as she stroked his long hair.
"She started to keep me as an animal.
No longer was I her pampered lover, I was locked in a dark cage, I was barely fed, and I was tormented by anyone who came by.
She used to have me beaten just to see me bleed.
I seemed to lose my mind, and I became the beast she wanted me to be.
I raged and struggled when she let someone use my body, and I attacked anyone who came too close to me.
It was amusing to her and her ilk to taunt me, to see how much I would hurt myself to get at them."
He shook in her arms, and she found herself pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
He sighed, wrapping an arm around her stomach, settling closer.</pre>
