        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <h4>Story 1</h4>
                    <pre>He had only taken two steps when he felt himself seized by an arm that appeared from behind the door and yanked him forward with great force.
Tripping over the mat, he fell heavily onto the floor.
Stunned and shocked he lay for a moment unable to move, and then curled up in agony as he was viciously kicked in his side.
The door slammed shut behind him, and Charlie howled out her fear and isolation in the darkness of the kitchen.
David lay curled up for a few moments, and then tried to lift himself up on his left elbow.
Horror and dismay filled him as he caught sight of Beth, lying slumped against the wall on the far side of the room.
A bruise stood out on her cheek and a tiny spot of blood hung from her lower lip.
"What the hell!"
he started to say, but a voice, quiet, yet full of menace, interrupted him.
"Stay where you are, bastardo.
She is not hurt badly."
As the man spoke, David felt himself pressed down onto the ground by what he took to be the heel of a shoe.
"Not yet, anyhow," the voice went on.
"Later perhaps things could change.
We'll see."
The voice was calm, matter-of fact, the voice of one in command, of one enjoying his power.
David shuddered as he recognised it.
The memory of when he had last heard it, in Italy, flashed into his mind, and with it the horror of what he had experienced there.
"Antonio," he muttered.
"You remember me!
I'm honoured."
Antonio said quietly.
"I said that you would be next.
You should have listened."
He took his foot away from David's back and moved into the centre of the room.
"You may stand," he said.
"But slowly.
I do not want to kill you immediately."
David painfully pushed himself away from the floor and stood up.
His side ached and his right knee was stinging, but he was more concerned with Beth and how she was.
He made a movement as if to go over to her, but Antonio stood in front of him and waved a finger in the air.
"Oh no," Antonio said, and smiled.
"If you want to get to her you've got to get past me."
The smile disappeared from his face and he said, "Do you understand?"
He took a step back.
"You see, it's a little game.
We used to play it at school.
To get to the other side, you have to get round the person in the middle."
His head turned a little to the left and an evil smile appeared on his lips.
"Or you have to take him out."
David suddenly had a flash back to the time when, as a boy, he was on his way to his first scout meeting and he had been confronted by another boy who had asked him for a fight.
Now, as then, he felt all his strength flow out.
His legs felt weak and he found he was unable even to clench his fists.
He made a move towards Beth.
Not an aggressive move, but just as fast as he felt himself able to do at that moment.
"Oh dear," sighed Antonio as he slammed his fist into David's midriff.
"It seems that this game isn't going to be as much fun as I thought it would be."
He had moved with lightning speed, but seemed to expend no effort at all.
He bent down and, with apparent ease, picked up David from the floor where he had collapsed, clutching his stomach, gasping for air and retching.
"You're going to have to do better than that," whispered Antonio as he pushed David back against the wall.
"Much better.
If you want her to live, that is."
David felt himself pinned back so that he was aware of the awkward unevenness of the cob against his spine.
His eyes were screwed up with pain so it was with difficulty that he saw before him Antonio's face smiling with arrogant conceit.
"I've had such a long time to think about how I'm going to kill you," Antonio said without any emotion in his voice.
"It's kept me interested all the time I've been slowly working my way here.
I thought, maybe I would use the knife, like I did with my puttana of a wife."
This last phrase was delivered with his only show of emotion as he spat the word 'puttana' out with venomous ferocity.
For the first time David felt anger beginning to rise up in him and made a futile attempt to move.
"Oh, that's good," cried Antonio.
"That's good.
So you're not entirely the emotionless, passionless English.
Perhaps we'll have some fun after all."
The Italian pulled David away from the wall and just as easily slammed him back against it.
"But I decided that the knife would be too easy.
There would be no satisfaction in it for me.
You understand?"
He looked at David with the same arrogant, superior smile on his face.
"So," he went on, "I've decided to kill you in the manner that would give me the most pleasure.
Capisci?"
Antonio waited for some reaction, but getting none, the smile left his face and he jerked his right knee into David's groin and stepped back.
His face was impassive as he watched his enemy fall to the floor screaming and clutching his agony.
Tears washed down David's face as he writhed in such pain that he was hardly aware of what Antonio said next.
"I've decided that we're going to fight.
We're going to fight for this ugly lump of girl."
He turned to the still form of Beth and waited, hoping for the maximum effect of his words, and then quietly, with deadly, vicious deliberation, he continued with, "And I am going to kill you."
He smiled with satisfaction.
"With my bare hands."
He walked over to David, lifted him to his feet and struck him across the face with the flat of his hand.
"Come on, then," he said.
"Now try to hit me."
David stood swaying, his whole body shuddering with pain, his eyes not focussing clearly, his fear showing openly in his open mouth and fixed expression.
"You're not even trying," screamed Antonio, and hit him several times in the face in rapid succession, followed by a sharp punch with rigid fingers in the solar plexus.
David lay on the floor and licked the blood on his lips.
His vision was blurred and he drifted in and out of awareness.
Time seemed to slow down and he seemed to see Antonio coming towards him in very slow motion.
Suddenly everything changed and he found himself back in the terror of one of his recurring dreams.
He was strapped to a table, unable to move and a foul figure was bending over him slapping him slowly across the face, muttering, "I'm going to kill you, now."
Present and past seemed to merge and he was then aware of Antonio bending over him, shaking him and slapping his face.
David seemed to have become immune to the pain, and was just aware of the concussion of the blows and, distantly, the sound of a voice.
He was also suddenly very aware of his fear and how it was stopping him from expressing his true feelings of anger against the indignities and the pain he was experiencing.
As he sank into the fear, a realisation blossomed in his mind, one that came as a frightening shock - that what he was experiencing he was allowing to happen because of one thing alone.
It was not because he was weaker.
It was not because the others were stronger or faster or better trained.
It was because he thought he deserved it.
He wanted it to happen in an attempt to assuage his guilt for what he had done to the girl in Italy.
Quickly there flashed before his mind's eye pictures of him going from Scotland to Italy and once more thrusting himself onto the girl Francesca Powell.
She had been sent there by her father and married to a close friend of the family.
Once more they were discovered together, but this time she also was beaten and broken and forced to watch him as he was tortured.
His guilt shifted to thoughts of Anna and the blame he secretly felt for what had happened to her, and he knew that what he wanted, secretly, had wanted for a long time was punishment for the wrong he felt he had done.
But then he thought of Beth and the love she had shown him, demanding nothing and accepting him just for what he was, and a feeling grew in him that she did not deserve this.
He owed her more than he could ever repay, and with this thought he felt a strength start to grow deep within him, a determination, which fed an anger against all people like Antonio, who use their knowledge and power to bully others.
He lay for a while feeling the blows on his face but now using their energy to build a bubble of rage which he suddenly allowed to erupt in a roar of anger as, with all the power he could muster, he smashed his fist across the bridge of the Italian's nose.
He didn't see the expression of surprise and disbelief that flooded over Antonio's face as he found himself hurtled across the room by the force of the blow.
For David sank immediately back on the floor, his strength spent by the energy he had expended.
And he also didn't see the look of satisfaction on the face of Beth as she smashed the heavy base of a mike stand across the head of the Italian.
"Ugly lump of a girl, eh?"
she said as he fell unconscious to the floor.
She looked at his head and said, "Now, there is an ugly lump."
With some difficulty, for she was still feeling a bit groggy from the blow she had suffered from the fist of the Italian, she staggered over to David.
"Come on," she called out to him as she tried to help him up.
"He's not going to be out for ever and we've got to get to the pub and ring for help."
David looked at her and the joy he felt in seeing her sent a surge of energy through him.
"What's happened?
Where's the scumbag?"
he groaned as she tried to lift him.
"I've given him a sore head, but he won't be out forever, so you've got to try to make it out of here."
"Why can't we ring for help from here?"
he asked as he struggled to his feet.
"He cut the wires before you came back."
She gasped as she strained with the effort of helping him to the door.
Charlie barked an excited greeting as they slowly opened the door into the kitchen and followed them reluctantly out into the rain and wind.
The hill leading to the pub was a struggle for both of them, a battle, not only against the weakness caused by the injuries they had received, but also against the ferocity of the storm that had sprung up since David had arrived back from the pub.
The wind howled from the South West, driving the rain into their faces as if it had sided with their enemy and was trying to slow down their flight.
However, the massive relief they felt on their escape from the terror of Antonio generated its own energy, and despite the apparent efforts of the elements to hinder them, they managed, muttering words of endearment and encouraged by a buoyant Charlie, dancing in front of them, to reach the pub, finally push the door open and fall in an undignified heap on the stone floor.
An unusual hush fell on the pub as the door flew open and they arrived, wet, dirty and with bruised faces streaked with blood.
Even Charlie realised that something was different, for, instead of rushing to the fire, as she normally did, she sat by the two of them with her tail wagging and barked her summons for help.
It arrived swiftly in the form of George, Alfred, and Norman plus two hikers who had arrived a few minutes earlier, escaping from the ferocity of the weather.
Together they helped the two bruised figures to stagger to the comforting warmth of the fire, where Tom waited for them with a couple of brandies he had hurriedly poured.
"What the hell happened to you two?"
cried George as he helped Beth onto a chair, but before either of them could utter a word, the door again burst open and Antonio strode in confidently, his face a mask of arrogant contempt for all.
In his left hand he held a gun, which he pointed at the group around the fire.
In his right he had a large dangerous looking knife.
"Well," he said, "what a delightful scene.
Our two heroes and all their yokel friends."
He stepped further into the room and smiled.
"Barman, a gin and tonic, if you please," he called out trying to mimic an English gentleman.
He was still smiling when he said with an evil sincerity, "If you do not hurry, I shall blow the brains out of two of your valuable customers."
With that he pointed his gun at the two hikers, who now were beginning to wish that they had remained in the comparative safety of the storm.
One of them, a slight, freckled faced lady fell to the ground in a faint.
"Typical English," said Antonio looking down at her with contempt.
"They're German, actually," muttered Tom as he passed to go to the bar.
"Perhaps, then I'll shoot them anyhow," said Antonio with a smile, his eyebrows raised.
The second German opened his mouth in horror and he bent down to cradle his partner in his arms.
"Koninchen, koninchen," he whispered tenderly, and gently rocked her, tears streaming down his face.
"Don't worry," Antonio said to him, "I've not come for you, or your revolting friend."
He turned to the bar, placed the knife on it and took the gin and tonic that Tom had hurriedly poured.
"He knows who I've come for," he said pointing at David.
"Don't you, bastardo?"
He spat out the epithet with disdain.
David turned to look at him, defeat and despair showing openly on his face.
The energy that had come to him with the thought of escape and freedom drained away leaving him with a profound feeling of hopelessness.
Antonio quickly drained the glass of its contents.
"Very good," he nodded at Tom.
"For an Englishman," he added with a sneer.
Then in business-like fashion he picked up his knife and stepped away from the bar into the centre of the room.
"The question is," he said in a matter of fact voice, "do I kill you now, here, in front of your yokel friends, or do I take you elsewhere and really enjoy myself?"
He smiled, "There's no difficulty, really.
Is there?"
He levelled the gun at David.
"Stand up, bastardo," he said quietly.
David stood very unsteadily and stared at his executioner.
Part of his mind registered that those near him had, with the exception of Beth, moved carefully away from him and he smiled.
"Come here, bastardo."
It was clear to all that Antonio was revelling in his power, savouring his moment of triumph.
As David moved towards him, shuffling and obviously still in pain, Antonio stepped to one side and motioned for him to pass by.
It was only when David had passed him that he realised that he had made a mistake.
For, in order to cover David he would have to turn his back on the rest of the bar, and if he covered the bar he would have to leave David unthreatened.
So Antonio compromised and walked sideways his gun wavering between his enemy and the customers of the pub.
As David reached the door and started to open it, a mighty gust of wind snatched it out of his hand and smashed it against the wall.
Taking advantage of the surprise caused by the sudden noise George, for he had been in his younger days a cricketer of note, threw a heavy glass ash tray with delightful accuracy at Antonio and struck him a glancing blow on the head.
"Run David!"
he shouted.
"Run!"
David looked back and saw Antonio had dropped the gun and was clutching his head, so he turned and ran as fast as his tired body could into the darkness and the welcome of the heath.
In the bar there was a roar as everybody took advantage of the reversal of fortunes and hurled everything to hand at the Italian.
He, realising he had, in his pain, staggered too far away from his gun to retrieve it, turned to face the mass of bodies rushing in his direction and waved the knife at them.
Quickly, but very carefully, he moved backwards, and, reaching the door, gripped the handle, stepped out into the night and slammed it shut.
Tom reached the door first, opened it, and everybody spilled out onto the road.
There they were met by the gale, the driving rain, and an impenetrable blackness.
On the heath David crouched in the middle of a circle of gorse bushes.
He had crossed the road as fast as was possible for him in a mindless panic, running blindly into a world of howling, icy winds, merciless needles of rain beating into his face, mud and impenetrable tangles of brambles and gorse.
He knew that there were only a few pathways open to anyone on the heath and realised that it would not be long before Antonio found him, so he had crawled under the bushes as far away from a track as possible, trying as best he could to ignore the painful scratches he received.
As he had crossed the road he had managed a glance back at the warmth of the light blazing out of the pub and had seen Antonio stagger out clutching his head.
The only pleasurable feeling he experienced came as he wondered who had managed to inflict some damage on the gangster.
There was another advantage to his position, in that the bushes gave him some shelter from the wind and rain, but he realised, nevertheless, that he would not be able to remain out in these conditions for very long without danger of hypothermia.
He had managed to hear Antonio cursing as he crashed through the unfamiliar terrain, and once indeed the gangster came within a very short distance of him, but fortunately turned away before discovering him.
After a while there was silence from him.
David realised that he too had gone to ground and was waiting to see how long David could last before giving away his hiding place.
Soon, even though he was well sheltered from the wind, David started to become acutely aware of the cold.
Beads of icy rain dripped down the inside of his collar and he realised that his feet had started to lose any feeling at all.
To escape his discomfort, for, besides the cold and wet, he was still suffering from the beating he had received from Antonio earlier on, he made a huge effort and turned his thoughts to Beth.
He had managed to catch sight of the look of despair and horror on her face as he had been forced to move towards the door of the pub, and he was surprised at how passionately he suddenly longed to be with her.
"At least the bastard didn't manage to get her," he thought, but then immediately there flashed into his mind a picture of Anna, lying in the bath in the apartment in Milan, and he understood clearly how much he had changed since that terrible night.
He realised how close he had got to Beth over the past three months, how swiftly the gap had widened between him and Anna.
It was with some surprise that the thought came to him that he hadn't thought of her since just before Christmas.
He had caught the mention of Milan on the news one night, which made him think of her, and he had fleetingly wondered how she was.
But then came the holiday rush and all he could think of was the job and gradually his need for Beth, professionally and personally, took over everything.
During the day he and Beth had spent a great deal of time at the cafe in St. Agnes, and a week ago, whilst they were all having coffee, out of the blue Anthony had suddenly turned the conversation to his dreams.
"You said just before New Year that you had stopped having dreams about the torture of the lutenist.</pre>

                    <pre>I'm willing to bet that whoever we take out would rather work for you than be a slave to Jabba."
Borshan and Danmar stared at each other, their brows rose in unison--Lando had a good point.
Chapter 18
I'm suffocating, Akbar reflected with a strange calm.
At least it feels like I'm suffocating.
Of course I've never done well in confined, darkened spaces huddled with many others.
And I've never been a prisoner before.
And then obviously there was the hunger brought on by meager rations which wouldn't satisfy a womprat.
Why not heap that on to the factors causing his extreme shortness of breath.
He felt as if his stomach was puckering against itself,  cramping agonizingly to remind him that food was vehemently required.
Naturally, it was doing him no good to ruminate on these ills.
He had to accept them as harsh realities tempered by fact that most of his life he had led a fairly pampered existence.
Being a senator used to generate a strong sense of purpose in Akbar's mind.
In the early days, much was done in the way of progress for his people.
Their wants, needs, and prayers were answered thanks to Akbar and his team's aggressive yet strangely non-threatening strategy of senate manipulation.
Service our needs and we promise you three-fold back in galactic benefit for the core systems.
And the promise was delivered.
Time and again.
But as always with every species that exists with higher sentience, when things are too good, there come the unconscious need to tear them down, to give the devil his due, as they say.
A new supreme chancellor--the timid and easily swayed Valorum Gazarra--allowed a blindness to happen within the interplanetary dealings.
And certain mon calamari's struck secret contracts with governmental officials to start receiving far more than was rightfully due them.
And then the Clone Wars eventually came to pass allowing an even greater disparity between the haves and have-nots--despite the concrete policies of the hardlining new supreme chancellor, Palpatine.
And suddenly, Senator Akbar, the once commander of the calamari navy, felt as impotent, purposeless, and suffocated as... well as he did now being a conscripted prisoner.
Whose work detail consisted of picking away at rock in the hopes of striking tibanna coal.
Pick, pick, pick, stab, stab, stab, dig, dig, dig at the cragged walls of black rock, scarcely finding the precious tibanna.
Mindless work for a fruitful, brilliant mind.
Not unlike the situation of course of the galactic senate in the past thirty or so years.
As Akbar desperately tried to recapture the greatness of The Republic yet was mired by futile searches for the ones who took too much and left virtually nothing for the rest.
In trying to get the calamari voice heard in the in the senate hearings but always being drowned out by endless debate.
How Akbar despised the greedy power elite--the abusers, the betrayers, the callous indifferent to the mass suffering of the galaxy.
Yet pitied them for these socialites led in his mind useless and shallow lives.
But mostly despised.
"Admiral!"
a whispery voice called out to Akbar.
Though his mind was pained with lack of oxygen and cancers of the past, he twisted his neck to glance at the one who called out to him--Dosh.
The personal aide crouched low as he ran toward the admiral and met him, placing a hand on his shoulder.
"Sir," Dosh continued, "we found the mole!
The traitor!"
As Dosh got this out, three more calamari's lowly trotted toward the two.
One was being forcefully escorted as his brethren flanked him and clasped his arms with crustacean-like hands.
Once they reached Akbar and Dosh, they shoved the captor to his knees and faced their superiors.
"This is him, sir," Dosh elaborated with conviction.
"I have no doubts."
"You have nothing!"
the held calamari balked.
"You've made a huge mistake!"
Dosh yanked up a small communicator and held it up to the suspected traitor's face.
"Then what was this doing underneath your cot?!"
"I told you I have no idea what it was doing there!"
"Of course you'd say that," said one of the calamari's gripping his arm.
"I hate to condemn one of our own," the other calamari captor admitted, "but I'm afraid it fits.
Amash here is the only one of us who has been with the regiment for the shortest amount of time."
Akbar pursed his aquatic-featured lips and drew in a deep breath, let it out.
"I'm afraid the circumstantial evidence against you is quite strong, Corporal."
"Sir," Amash pleaded, "if I could have been with you longer, I would have.
But my family needed me."
Akbar afforded himself an instant or two of mind pouring, and washing down of the facts, the damning evidence.
"I loathe to condemn one of our own, myself, but...
I'm afraid we must keep you under constant watch from now on, son."
"Sir," Amash said, eyes wide, "all I've ever waned to do is serve you and the alliance."
"If that's true, then you will cooperate fully with us and not attempt to make any trouble.
And you cannot know our plans from this point on."
Amash buried his eyes as bowed his head humiliatingly low.
"...
I understand."
"Dosh, let him go."
"Sir," Dosh began with controlled alarm, "do you really feel that's wise, admiral?"
"He can't alert them now without revealing that we already know he's a spy."
Dosh's eyes darted to the side as his head began one long nod.
"And after that they would kill him, I see..."
Then he locked eyes on Amash.
"...
But be warned, young one, we will be watching your every move now."
Feeling like a small fish under a very large microscope, Amash scurried off the moment he was unhanded.
Dosh looked after the fleeing calamari, as did Akbar.
The other two men followed after Amash, making sue not to lose the suspected traitor.
Dosh turned back to Akbar.
"Hopefully, this puts us back on track."
With a bit of a prideful grin, Akbar cheered, "Good work, Dosh.
I've always been able to count on you, son."
Dosh bowed his head briefly with a satisfactory smile forming his lips.
Then Akbar turned serious.
"Now we have to move up the raid.
It is likely that the imperials will wonder why they haven't received any new information from Amash."
"If we succeed in getting out of here, sir, do we still take him with us?"
"Yes, he must stand trial."
"He may slow us down.
Possibly even get us killed."
"Nevertheless."
Suddenly, a spray of ebony pebbles stung the backs of the two men.
"Return to work!"
thundered the guard who had kicked up the stones.
Akbar and Dosh briskly dispersed from each other and set about the endless task again.
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig....
Chapter 19
Eighteen men from Bestine were born into slavery.
None of them directly owed debts to their owners fro it was all merely ancestral contracts passed down from those who borrowed far too much.
And had the misfortune of being weak in character.
Or simply tragic luck in their risky investments.
Bestine had its laws, its traditions, as any world or subculture did.
And a longstanding edict for the countries therein mandated that debts be paid in "Tree Branch" servitude.
"Tree Branch" referring to slave family trees that "branched" out with their offspring to carry the burden of working off almost innumerable debt.
Some slave owners were honorable, and set down reasonable limits of repayment for "Tree Branch" services.
Thus eventually allowing the families to become free of servitude obligations.
None of the eighteen, however, who were to be sold to a baron on Ansion, were fortunate enough to be owned by such fair-minded individuals.
All, as it happened, were conscripted by a ruthless, cunning count who took advantage of an addendum in the law.
The addendum stated: slave owners may set terms of the contract for the duration of the conscription.
Translation: an owner may set the price for a slave's rate of work; if a slave works a full day of hard labor, it might represent only one credit against the debt.
And if the credits owed amounted in the hundreds of thousands--or even millions... then "tree branchers" likely never stood a chance of seeing freedom.
The owners could also, as had just been attempted, sell their conscripts off world to the highest bidder.
The count who sold the eighteen men hoped to make a sizeable profit while still keeping enough conscripts to perform the necessary menial tasks.
But soon he would be receiving a transmission from the Ansion baron that the slaves never arrived.
And that the crediting to count's personal bank account would be placed on hold.
Both count and baron were about to reach new levels of rage and accusations.
But that was of no concern to Borshan as he walked the halls of Jabba's illustrious palace.
In his hand he held a blaster that was trained on the eighteen slaves who trotted along ahead of him.
Danmar similarly held the men in corral with his own pointed weapon.
One other man poised a weapon on the conscripts--a man who had very recently been liberated.
And was indeed, as Lando predicted, quite pleased to be working for Borshan now--as opposed to joining his fellow Bestinians into Jabba's den of suffering slaves.
The unfortunate indentured were all suited and helmeted in the traditional Ansion guard regalia, complete with bladed gaffee sticks.
Although each guard held the impressive weapons, none would be a match for well placed blaster hits.
And thus not one of the marching slaves raised their sticks in defiance or protest.
They simply walked where Borshan told them to walk, toward Jabba's main audience chamber, to new conscription.
To likely a fate worse than death.
And Lando was now one of them.
"Ah Borshan," Jabba bellowed in deep, booming native tongue, "I see you've brought me new security numbers.
Excellent, my good boy."
"As promised, as promised," Borshan replied with a profit-induced smile as he herded the slaves into the main audience chamber.
"May they serve you well in protecting your grand establishment."
Jabba's lackeys, his hanger-ons, stood around the clearing of the chamber, which was the center of the room, ogling and mumbling comments regarding the new acquisitions.
Jabba merely lounged on his massive slab, leaned on his post, and puffed his trusted wire pipe as he observed the scene before him.
"I believe we discussed two thousand a head, did we not?"
Borshan jovially nodded once while saying, "That we did, and thanks for a fair price indeed."
"And how would you prefer payment this time?"
"Oh, account crediting suits me fine."
"Very well then.
Fortuna..."
And Jabba's majordomo, Bib Fortuna came forth to face the hutt. "...see that it is done."
Bib nodded and hastily departed.
Jabba refocused on Borshan.
"Borsh, you seem short of your usual compliment of men."
Sour faced, Borshan breathed, "Aahh, lost them in the acquisition.
Risks of the trade."
"My condolences.
Stay a while and drink to their memory."
Another nod and a half grin.
"Thank you, don't mind if I do."
A servant girl came forth and offered Borshan, Danmar, and the former slave/new employee drinks.
All three partook.
Fortuna reappeared and glided up to Jabba's side.
"Master, I have favorable news--Boba Fett has arrived at Mos Eisley.
And he will be bringing Solo here shortly."
"Excellent," Jabba cracked loudly to all.
"A toast, everyone," And he raised his personal stein of ale.
The crowd of lackeys raised their own drinks.
"To Boba Fett--the bounty hunter who always gets his man!"
The room erupted with, "To Boba!"
then they downed hardy gulps their various concoctions.
Chewie, damn it, Lando urged in his mind, as if somehow the wookiee might be able to psychically hear him.
Tell me you've made it to Mos Eisley to intercept Fett!
Don't let him reach this palace with Han in tow, PLEASE...
Chapter 20
"So..."
Luke began with strained believability etched in his expression, "they're just simply going to let us go?
That's it?"
Luke had asked this on a moment after Jorman had entered to join the stunned boy in the main hold of Jorman's ship.
And explained to him that indeed they would be shortly debarking from the imperial convoy.
"That's it," Jorman replied with a shrug.
"As I told you, they believe me to be a shadow agent working for the emperor.
So whatever I order them to do... they do."
"Incredible," Luke remarked with an impressive tone.
"I mean I've seen it done before but... not on this big of a scale."
Once again, Jorman shrugged.
"The benefits of dealing with weak minds.
I'm sorry, I've interrupted your training session, haven't I?"
"I hadn't got too far into it actually."
Luke held up the lightsaber that Jorman had given him to use.
"I've just been getting used to this saber, the feel of it and all."
"Well, if you have, let me see what you can do."
"Got it," Luke said as he spun around to ignite the saber, its greenish-white glow served to paint Luke's form in the same color.
"Remotes activate," he commanded and the three practice globes lit up and shot into the air to surround the swordsman.
He whipped his blade into an attack stance and the remotes sailed this way and that, avoiding collision.
They spat shocker blasts--laser lances that provided only a small shock sensation to the subject, to Luke.
But he maneuvered his saber in odd spirals to cleverly deflect each bombardment.
Jorman studied Luke's movements, his tactics, his style.
It was clear that the boy had training from quite experienced combat saber men.
Nothing was getting through his defenses.
However, Jorman also noticed that in Luke's swipes, parries, and so forth, a perfection of moment fluidity was missing.
It'll come in time, Jorman mused, the boy is still young.
And still, what he was seeing from him was quite-- "Impressive," Jorman completed his thought out loud.
"Remotes deactivate."
The remote globes ceased their assault and resolved themselves to equidistant positions in mid air.
Luke walked back over to Jorman, breathy from the vigorous activity.
"Thanks," he said, acknowledging the compliment.
"Benefits of not wanting to get shocked again."
Jorman cracked a half grin, but then continued on with his assessment.
"Your movements are predominantly smooth and effective.
Perhaps a bit of refinement could be made here and there.
But otherwise you're coming along...
Who were your instructors?"</pre>
