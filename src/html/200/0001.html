        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <pre>A moment later the telephone double beeped and he picked up the receiver, still standing in the same position.
The conversation was short.
"Hello, George.
What happened last night?...
"Are the locals doing anything?...
"Brush, you say.
Is she seasonal?...
"Keep the same one on it.
Tell her to keep me informed of any developments...
"Affirmative, but no later than tomorrow...
"Thank you, George."
He cradled the receiver, then held a button and asked for messages.
He lowered himself into his chair, lit his first cigarette of the day and waited, expressionless, for Suzanne to appear.
Chapter 5
Twenty-four red and white heifers stood side by side, eating hay from a pair of wood bunks close to one side of the pen, unaware of the struggle behind them.
Pat had known as soon as he had seen her that she was in trouble, had stopped his customary whistling and humming and fed the others some extra ration so they'd move away from her.
She lay with her head thrown back and a bit of foam coming from one side of her mouth.
He approached her from behind, speaking softly so as not to frighten her, then laid a hand on her neck to be sure she was aware of his presence, wouldn't jump up and go berserk.
She breathed a weak bawl, kicked a bit, moved her head back and forth along the ground, then threw herself into the same position from which she started.
Pat grabbed her by the ears and lifted her head up, swung it forward and down, then pushed his right foot as far as he could under her shoulder so she wouldn't roll back.
He stood there with the one leg braced against her back, still holding her head by the ears, trying to get her into some position that he thought would let her heart start pumping blood to all the necessary parts again.
While he stood there, he talked to her in a low, reassuring voice.
"Easy, mama.
Take your time.
I'm not here to hurt you, El Stupido, just trying to save your life if you don't mind.
So stay cool and we'll get along just fine.
OK?
Take it easy, old girl.
And don't roll your eyes at me that way.
Save it for the old bull.
Just lie still a minute and things'll start to look a bit better.
You're doing OK, now, so just wait till your eyes get focused again.
Maybe if you'd switch your tail or something to let me know you were going to be OK I'd feel a little better.
Too bad you can't talk and tell me what's wrong.
But you wouldn't know anyway, would you girl?
After all, you're not the brightest critter on God's green earth, are you?
So just settle back and wait a minute.
Do you feel like talking to the vet?
No, I don't suppose you would.
But don't go to thrashing around and break my leg.
OK?
Just take it easy ...atta girl..."
Jenny Brush stood outside the pen, watching the heifers as they tore off and then chewed mouthfuls of the green, sweet-smelling hay and listened to the nonsense coming from inside the pen.
She had found no one in the house so had walked toward any movement she could see.
The man leaning over the red and white cow and talking in its ear had evidently not heard her approach.
She didn't want to be here, didn't particularly like the man, and so didn't offer to help or even to make her presence known.
She felt it unfortunate that she had been on duty when the call had come in.
Why hadn't K gone instead?
Or Jones?
The Park director usually did all the work that involved any kind of official outside the Park.
Of course, Mr. Jones had taken the afternoon off and was, therefore, not available.
And K was busy with a group of Boy Scouts.
So it had befallen Jenny, whose turn it was to work the last shift, to drive to East Gate and deal with Deputy Botts, a chore she had carefully avoided ever since she had to deal with the man to clear up a minor misunderstanding about the places in which she could and couldn't leave a Park vehicle while in East Gate.
She watched silently as Pat pushed his leg farther under the animal and continued to talk in a low, even voice.
He had winked at her the evening before while sitting in the East Gate office of the county police.
In a bad mood to begin the evening, Deputy Botts had soured her farther when he had patted her backside as she leaned over to retrieve some forms from the cabinet.
Pat's wink had affixed her scowl for the rest of the evening.
It had been an innocuous wink, but it was a wink never-the-less and Jenny Brush hated winkers.
Her Uncle Henry had been a winker and she shuffled all winkers into the same category as her Uncle Henry.
Every summer her mother had put her on a bus bound for Kansas to visit Uncle Henry and Aunt Fran.
They lived about as far from anywhere as she thought it possible to get.
Uncle Henry always met the bus with the same black car, so old it still had running boards along each side, although they had mostly rusted away, and had the spare mounted in the fender instead of fastened securely in the trunk.
As soon as they had all stepped into the house Uncle Henry would invariably run his hand over her front, wink and say, "When you gonna grow some tits, girl?"
then burst out with a high-pitched, lecherous laugh.
And then Aunt Fran would join in, her ample bosom and bottom pitching and rolling with the onslaught.
Jenny Brush hated winkers.
She watched silently, immobile, as he continued to hold the cow's head and talk softly to it.
The image presented this morning seemed to be at odds with the one presented to her the night before.
Deputy Botts had filled her with stories of marijuana and whiskey, motorcycles and rowdy parties, wild men and wilder women.
He seemed to glory in the times this Ivers and one of his cronies named Walt had spent in the county jail under Russell's watchful eye.
He had almost sounded disappointed when his story ended with Ivers going into rehab at the VA hospital in Capital rather than doing any time in the state's prison facility, the Big Lockup as he called it.
Suddenly the cow seemed to get her second wind.
Jenny jumped as it bellowed forcefully, stiffened its legs, threw its head back, and died.
Pat was thrown off balance and went backward, his right foot caught halfway under.
He pivoted his torso on the way down to relieve the tension on his lower leg and landed without uttering a sound in at least one pile of manure.
"Cranky old bitch," he said, but softly and with no trace of anger in his voice.
His clean hand went to the left side of his head, near the bruise that spread across his temple.
"Crap," he said a little louder, and shook the cold, wet mass from his other hand as best he could.
He waited a minute until the throbbing in his head stopped and then struggled to get out from under the approximately half ton of suddenly limp bovine while rolling in the manure as little as possible.
"Why'd you have to go and die like that, you old crank?
Didn't give me much of a chance, did you?"
He rolled the other way, put his free left foot on the cow's back, pushed and strained and finally retrieved his right foot.
"And then you had to go and throw me in a pile of shit, you ungrateful old mongrel airhead."
He slipped the heel of his sneaker back on his foot and retied it, then got to his feet and looked down at the cow, wiped the biggest pieces of manure from his pants with a finger and shook them off as best he could.
He reached down and wiped his hands on the cow, turned and wiped most of the traces off his pants against her back.
This done, he stood, turned toward the cow, grabbed her ears again and lifted her head up to make sure she was indeed beyond help.
"Dead as a doornail, you old biddy," he muttered as he turned away.
The color rose in his face when he noticed the lady in uniform standing there.
"Oh," he muttered, and lowered his eyes.
He grabbed his cap by the bill and took it off and held it in both hands.
"I didn't know anyone was here."
Jenny shrugged and said, "What happened?"
"She died."
"I can see that," she said, thought to herself, 'What a jerk,' then out loud, "Was she sick?"
"No." Jenny stood there and watched his discomfort.
He motioned toward the cow with the cap, then grabbed the bill with both hands again, looked alternately at the ground, the cow, and Jenny.
"At least I don't think so," he finally continued.
He stood uncomfortably in the middle of the pen for a moment, started to say something, shut his mouth, and walked through the pen toward her.
He stood for a minute at the end of the bunks and looked over the remaining heifers.
The closest one raised her head and he reached over and rubbed between her ears.
She tolerated this for a few seconds, then shook her head and went back to her hay.
Pat glanced over the group once more, then continued to the fence and climbed over.
"They have a kind of, you know, a self-destructive habit of shutting off their, um, their heart sometimes," he explained as he stood up.
"They just lie on it wrong, you know, get their legs uphill and then, like, can't get going again.
Anyway, I, um, I guess that's what this one did," he looked back into the pen at the dead cow.
"Although you wouldn't think there was enough of a, um, you know, a slope in there for her to get into such a fix."
"I'm Jenny Brush.
We met at Deputy Botts' office last night," she held out her hand and tried to keep all warmth out of her voice.
"Yes, I remember," he said, holding out and looking at both of his own manure covered hands, palms up.
"Excuse my, um, smell."
He thought he had recognized her the previous evening, had glanced surreptitiously at her several times trying to remember where it had been.
Once their eyes had met and he blushed and lowered his gaze, but not before the offending, almost involuntary wink.
It wasn't until the long drive home that he remembered, and then could hardly wait to get to the pile of papers stacked neatly in one corner.
He opened the second section of the most recent Capitol Herald-Gazette and scanned it until he found a short, two paragraph editorial written by one Jenny Brush.
He went through several more and found not only editorials but several articles dealing with activities and happenings in Tinker's Maze Park.
He finally found a two week old paper with a picture to accompany the editorial.
Sure enough, it was the same Jenny Brush.
He bent over, pulled one of the few plants growing in the immediate vicinity, and used it to wipe his jeans and then his hands until only a bright green smear remained.
"Nasty stuff," she ventured.
She tried to keep her voice as cold as it had been up to this point but failed.
Warmth was her forte, a quick smile and easy laugh that matched the twinkle in her dark eyes.
Anything else was an act and she carried it off only with difficulty.
"A little bile, a little hay, not much else.
It, you know, um, it looks, smells worse than it is."
"A rose by any other name," she said, cold again.
Shakespeare seemed only a bit out of place.
"You're not here to talk about my cow," he ventured after they had walked in silence a few paces.
"No, I'm not."
Cold gave way to official.
"In fact, I'm here to talk about last night.
Russell wasn't very satisfied."
Pat stopped and looked at the mountains that rose behind the cow's pen.
Then he turned to the young lady and asked, "Did I, um, leave something out or, you know, like put too much in?"
"We tried to reach you earlier this morning but couldn't come up with your number here so I was volunteered to drive over and see if you would come back and get some things straight about last night."
Pat stopped, put both hands in his hip pockets and rocked back on his heels as he looked up.
Jenny also stopped and waited for his response.
His thought process seemed to her to be slow, almost torpid, as if he mentally surrounded a subject and then chose carefully the bits he wished to talk about before saying anything.
It was at the completely opposite end of the spectrum from her own quick and sometimes ill thought out responses.
Finally he started to walk again, hands still in the pockets, and said, "I can come over later this afternoon if there's, um, more paperwork.
Right now I should, you know, probably get the vet and see, um, see just why that old biddy kicked off.
Just to make sure it's, you know, not contagious, you understand."
They walked a short distance in silence before Jenny said, "You want to tell me again just exactly what you saw and where you saw it?"
She looked up at him, noticed again the scar that ran through his eyebrow, making it look as if there were two short ones over his right eye and causing the eyelid itself to droop.
This fascinated her.
The people she had known during her life were all still perfect.
Their only scars were small ones garnered while shaving or from other minor accidents.
Every nose was still straight.
None of them limped or winced from pain when they moved.
He stopped, but this time didn't hesitate with his reply.
"I explained that last night.
The Timini Trail.
You know, the one that goes off Deer Run and up past Black Lake.
I would guess, oh, like maybe three or four klicks past the lake, maybe a little more.
It's hard to tell exactly.
You know, where the trail switches back on itself."
She looked at him in an accusatory manner.
"I know what you said.
It's just that I thought there was maybe another trail like the Timini that got you confused or maybe we didn't go far enough or something.
Nobody could find it."
He thought back on the previous afternoon, extracting the location and all the other details from his memory as he started to walk again, changed directions as they rounded the end of another pen made from thick weathered boards and railroad ties like all the rest.
"I'm going to call the vet.
Have to go in to Polton to call.
I, uh, don't have a phone you know.
If Doc can get here yet this morning I can maybe, um, get you straightened out this afternoon."
Their feet kicked up little puffs of dust as they walked through what might once have been the front yard for the unpainted house that would have looked as though no one lived in it except for some torn curtains in the two small front windows and the fact that the front door was shut rather than hanging half open as was the case with most of the abandoned houses in the valley.
And the porch light was on.
"But it's pretty much like I said, you know, just past Black Lake a bit.
There's only, uh, one trail there.
At least, just one hiking trail.
Not used very much.
I think it, you know, pretty much ends after the switch backs, just kind of fades away once it hits tree line.
If you keep going you just come back down this side or else, um, follow the ridge over to Eagle Peak and then take that trail back down.
But that's a long ways over to the Peak, and this side isn't all that interesting.
At least, not like the Park side.
You know, mostly just kind of an easy slope, a little open grazing, lots of scrub and timber."
"I know what it's like."
Jenny didn't like being lectured to.
"I work there, you know.
It's my job to know the trails, the marked trails, anyway.
I've been over them all several times during the course of my employment and I don't need instructions from you."
Pat stopped and looked at her, almost smiled as he said, "I didn't mean to imply you didn't know them.
I was just being sure we were talking about the same place.
OK?"
They walked in silence toward the green pickup truck with the official emblem fading off the door.
As they approached it Jenny looked at him and said, "Do you really live here or do you just have your cows here?
I mean, if Russell needs you again, where can you be found?"
"Yeah, I live here all right."
He glanced at her and noticed the disbelief written all over her face.
She didn't bother to hide it so he continued, "Well, not exactly right here.
Not in the house.
I mean, I used to but now, you know, I kind of, like, well, live, um, I live over there."
He pointed toward a bulge in the mountain side with a huge ramshackle door hanging on broken hinges.
"Over there," he repeated when her eyes had scanned past the bulge more than once.
"Still, um, leave a light on in the house, though.
That's for Walt, you know.
But I don't, like, stay there anymore."
She shaded her eyes, scanned the direction he had pointed, finally rested her gaze on the bulge, shook her head in disbelief and said, "But that's a potato bunker, right?"
"Yeah.
Well, it was.
But I've kind of moved in."</pre>

                    <h4>Story 2</h4>
                    <pre>When he viewed the enlargement he noticed a series of numbers beside it, so small that they were almost invisible to the naked eye - 27459.
He quickly copied them down on a sheet of paper.
What could they mean?
The first thing he tried was to turn to page 27459 in the Spell Book but found that this page only contained a spell for turning lead to silver.
He let out a deep sigh.
At that moment he happened to look up at the shelves that lined the walls of the Ancient Library and contained the hundreds of thousands of volumes.
The shelves were numbered according to the subject of the books they contained to make it easier to locate the volume you desired.
However, he knew that there were nowhere near 27,000 categories.
It seemed that he had struck another stumbling block.
He looked at the numbers again and a light bulb lit up in his brain.
He picked up a pencil and put a decimal point after the number 4 - 274.59.
He knew immediately that he had found the secret.
Hurrying over to the shelves as fast as his creaky old legs could carry him, he followed the shelves around the walls until he came to the section marked 274 in gold letters, "History of Magic".
This section contained hundreds of books that had probably never been referred to in thousands of years.
He let out another tired sigh when he discovered that no volume had a decimal number printed on its spine.
Time to think logically again.
He was certain that he was on the right track.
Now he only had to figure out what the number 59 meant.
The first option that came to mind was to start at the beginning of the section and count each book until he reached volume 59.
When he did this he found a thick, leather-bound book titled, "Advanced Spells From The Tenth Millenium Before The Establishment Of  Perisus".
He knew that  Perisus was the famous capital city that had lasted for thousands of years before crumbling into decay when terrible sandstorms began raging across the desert.
He also knew that, during the height of its fame, the city was the centre of magic and attracted Shamans and others from around the cosmos.
This had to be it.
He felt certain that he had found the book with the locking spell by using the simplest method of all.
It seemed that his future with Maximilian would be safe.
With his heart beating rapidly he carried the book to a reading desk and opened it to the contents page.
He scanned the chapters and there it was - "How To Lock Spells".
"Eureka!"
shouted The Keeper and he began to read the instructions.
The incantation to infuse a wand with the locking spell was clearly set out and also included the method for cancelling the spell.
The Keeper fetched a pencil and began to copy down the incantation.
He was so excited that he broke the lead in three pencils before he was finished.
He finally sat back and considered his achievement.
The small asterisk had obviously been put in the Spell Book as a secret clue to link the freezing spell with more advanced magic.
Just as he had noticed it and drawn conclusions, so had the Shaman, Ekon.
Then it had simply been a matter of experimentation, trying various solutions until they struck gold.
How wonderful.
How clever.
Now he had to get the information to his Master, Maximilian.
Where could that mischievous elf, Husan, be?
He hurried out of the Ancient Library, spell in hand, to track down the little imp.
Husan was out of favour and restricted to the palace since he had been rescued from the giant squid by Maximilian during Matilda's Neptune adventure.
His job was to clean the Ancient Library and dust the books and shelves.
However, The Keeper found him out in the courtyard enjoying a game of Seega, an ancient Arabic game like checkers, with another elf.
"What are you doing out here?"
demanded The Keeper.
"You should be inside dusting the books."
"Oh," replied Husan, stifling a yawn, "I got bored with that and then I thought to myself, 'You've earned a break'.
So here I am."
"You've earned nothing, that's what you've done," shouted The Keeper.
"And you've learnt nothing as well.
After what you did with Neptune you're lucky to even be here."
But chastising the little imp was a waste of breath.
He only saw what he wanted to see and that was mostly what would benefit him.
He quickly changed the subject.
"Anyway, why are you chasing me?"
he asked.
"I have an important message that I must get to Maximilian," said The Keeper, "and, as he's in Frizland at the moment, the only way to reach him is by using your telepathy."
"Aha," laughed Husan cheekily, "so now you need me.
Well isn't that interesting since I'm involved in this game of Seega at the moment and it looks like I'm winning so I'm afraid you're going to have to wait."
He crossed his arms in defiance.
"Why, you little whippet-snippet," blustered The Keeper, utterly shocked by the impudence of the elf.
"You cheeky little pest.
Wait 'til I tell Maximilian."
The mention of his Master brought Husan back to earth.
He was in enough trouble with Maximilian already without adding to his record.
"Hmm-ph, very well," he snorted, "if Maximilian needs my help, how could I refuse?
What do you need me to do?"
"That's better," said The Keeper.
"I want you to send our Master a message by telepathy.
I'll write it down for you and you have to make sure you send it exactly as it's written.
Do you understand?"
"Of course," said the elf cockily.
"You know you can trust me."
The Keeper took out a pencil, opened his copy of the two spells, and wrote the message to Maximilian.
He handed it to Husan who studied it for several minutes, closed his eyes and sent the instructions to his Master.
Chapter 29 The Shamans' Cave
Maximilian wasn't far behind Fizzcrank as he sped across the snow and into the forest.
He just knew that the troll was somehow involved in the disappearance of Matilda and he intended finding out what had happened to her.
As he entered the forest he saw Fizzcrank's sleigh in the distance.
He was heading towards the mountains.
Maximilian slowed down and dropped back so as not to be seen.
Fizzcrank finally arrived at the grove of fir trees that concealed the entrance to the Shamans' cave.
He climbed the final slope on foot and disappeared from view just as Maximilian pulled up below the mountain.
He decided to pull back into the cover of the forest and see what happened as he had no idea what was behind the fir trees.
When he had positioned the sleigh so that he could see the grove of trees, he settled down to watch.
It was only a matter of minutes before figures appeared from behind the fir trees.
Four of the figures were dressed in robes but had their hoods down so that Maximilian could identify Rashi.
He didn't recognise the others, the tallest of whom was poking his finger at Fizzcrank's chest but the troll didn't seem offended.
The confrontation came to an end as Fizzcrank jogged down the slope, hopped into his sleigh and headed back towards the forest.
Maximilian quickly took up the reins and turned his sleigh around.
He moved off the track that Fizzcrank would use and waited.
When the troll's sleigh reached his hiding place, Maximilian spurred his horses forward so that they blocked the path.
Fizzcrank's progress was brought to a sudden halt.
Maximilian could see the fear in the troll's eyes as he recognised who had stopped him.
He jumped down and tried to sprint into the trees but Maximilian simply lifted a wand from his robes and froze the troll in his tracks.
He climbed down from his sleigh and walked over to the frozen figure.
Within two minutes the spell wore off and Fizzcrank slumped to the ground, shaking his head.
"Not as permanent as your spell," said Maximilian, looking down at the sad figure lying in the snow, "but nonetheless useful for rogues like you."
"It's not my spell," protested Fizzcrank.
"The Shaman's used it.
I had nothing to do with the spells."
"Perhaps not," said Maximilian, " but you have been helping them in their cause."
"Only because they threatened me," the troll lied.
"They said they would freeze me for good if I didn't do what they asked.
I had no choice."
"Rubbish!"
shouted Maximilian.
"The only fear I've seen from you was when you saw me.
Even when the Shaman was poking you in the chest you didn't seem afraid.
Who is he and why was he angry with you?"
"His name is Ekon and he said I shouldn't have come to the cave," said Fizzcrank.
"What cave?"
interrupted Maximilian.
"The Shamans' cave is behind the trees.
It's their base," Fizzcrank informed him.
"It's where they have the little girl."
"Matilda?"
"Yes," said the troll.
"They forced me to bring her here so that they could stop you from interfering."
"How can I get to her?"
asked Maximilian.
"Impossible," stated the troll.
"There are servants everywhere and you would be seen straight away.
And Ekon has strong magic, even stronger than yours."
"I doubt that," said Maximilian grimly, "but I'll have to confine you while we find out."
He took the rope belt out of his robe and tied Fizzcrank securely to a nearby tree.
He also tied the troll's sleigh to a branch with the horse's reins.
Having done that he climbed back into his own sleigh and headed for the Shamans' cave.
Chapter 30 Checkmate
Maximilian had been seen.
One of the troll servants was out for a stroll in the forest and watched from behind a tree as Maximilian stopped Fizzcrank's sleigh.
He hurried back to the Shamans' cave to report what he had observed.
He stumbled breathlessly into the room where Ekon was sitting with Rashi and told them that Maximilian was in the forest below.
Ekon simply smiled.
"Come to rescue his little friend, has he?
Well he's in for the surprise of his life.
It couldn't have been more perfect."
He pulled his wand from the pocket of his robe and waved it in the air.
"We needn't worry about his interference any more; we have the power to destroy him.
And we'll do it in front of the girl.
Bring her to the front of the cave."
A servant troll hurried off to follow Ekon's order.
Matilda was being kept in a cell in the furthermost part of the cave.
Apart from the fact that the cell was quite small, she was comfortable.
There was a bed, a wash-basin and a toilet and the steel door ensured her privacy.
A collection of books on the bedside table gave her something to pass the time and she was fed regularly with tasty meals.
The thing that worried her was the effect her disappearance would have on Maximilian when he discovered that she was missing.
He would be devastated, and all because of her disobeying his wishes.
Matilda was surprised when the door to her cell suddenly opened and a troll servant motioned her outside.
She stepped into the corridor and followed the troll to the front of the cave where the Shamans were waiting.
Two trolls stood either side of her when the party moved out of the cave, through the grove of fir trees and out into the open as a sleigh appeared from the forest below.
Maximilian had paused on his journey back to the Shamans' cave to consider his options.
He knew that Ekon had the power to freeze him permanently and that he had to avoid being exposed.
On the other hand, he had to get past the Shamans to rescue Matilda.
He finally decided to take his chances, confront the Shamans and, using his spell shield, hope for the best.
Perhaps if he were to use his own short-term freezing spell to stun them for a brief time he would be able to rescue Matilda.
He saw that as his only chance.
As his sleigh cleared the forest Maximilian looked up to see the Shamans and Matilda standing in front of the grove of fir trees at the top of the slope.
They walked down towards him as he halted his sleigh below.
He climbed out of the sleigh, took his wand from beneath his robe then waved his hands down his sides to invoke the spell shield.
His back was protected by a large boulder and there were hillocks of snow on either side.
His disadvantage now was that, with the spell shield in front of him, he couldn't use his wand.
He watched as Ekon came forward from the group.
"You can put that little stick away, Maximilian," said Ekon, pointing to Maximilian's wand with his own.
"It won't help you when I freeze you for good."
He was unaware of the spell shield as he pointed his own wand at Maximilian and muttered the incantation for the permanent freezing spell.
A look of shock came across his face when the spell didn't work.
"What the ... ?"
he exclaimed and repeated the incantation.
Nothing.
Maximilian smiled.
"Having a problem, my friend?"
He wanted to upset Ekon and distract him until he could remove the spell shield and use his own wand.
Ekon went red in the face.
"What have you done?"
he screamed.
"You can't escape the spell!"
This time he shouted the incantation, thrusting his wand forward in anger.
Still nothing.
The other Shamans were watching Ekon's failure in amazement and Matilda's heart was thumping as she saw her hero doing the impossible.
However, just when it seemed that neither Ekon nor Maximilian could achieve what they wanted, the stalemate was broken from an unlikely source.
Ekon's screams had awoken a polar bear, dozing behind one of the snow banks that were beside Maximilian.
The large animal suddenly appeared at the top of the snow bank, saw Ekon screaming and charged towards him.
It hit the Shaman before he could react, knocking him to the ground.
His wand flew into the air and landed in the snow.
The other Shamans had quickly retreated along with Matilda when they saw the bear attack.
Maximilian had his chance; he reversed the spell shield and pointed his wand, not at Ekon, but at the bear which stood with gaping jaws over the Shaman.
The animal was instantly frozen but Ekon could not escape from beneath it.
Maximilian calmly walked over to the Shaman's wand and retrieved it from the snow.
"How quickly things change," said Maximilian, looking down on Ekon.
"Get this monster off me," shouted Ekon.
"All in good time," replied Maximilian, delighting in the Shaman's discomfort.
At that moment the polar bear came out of the spell and dropped dizzily to the ground beside Ekon.
"Thank goodness for that," stated Ekon as he attempted to stand up.
"Uh, uh," said Maximilian, shaking his head.
"Now it's your turn."
He pointed his own wand at Ekon and the Shaman was frozen to the spot.
The bear slowly climbed to its feet and wandered off groggily over the snow bank.
Maximilian then turned his attention to the other Shamans who had been watching with horror as events unfolded.</pre>
