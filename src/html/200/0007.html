        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

And she endured his praise, freely surrendered this time to adoration.
Chapter 18
On the clear hot Saturday morning, Zach and Becca decided to take their landlord up on his offer of a day's use of his double-wide parked on a waterfront lot at Bodie Lake, the state's largest manmade reservoir, the lot about an hour's drive north of Shefford along a thinly travelled interstate and a few miles of country roads.
Becca's first impulse was to call Mrs. Brackett to see if Jonah wanted to join them, but she suppressed that initial urge.
Jonah was safe with his great-grandmother and well-supplied with art projects and weekend reading assignments from Mrs. Anders.
This day would be for her and Zach.
They hurried about the small kitchen like excited school kids before a field trip and threw together a lunch commensurate to that theme--diagonally sliced peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches with store-bought white bread, potato chips in pleated plastic bags, seedless white grapes washed and wrapped in paper towels, and a four bottles of cream soda buried in ice in a small red and white cooler.
Becca closed the bedroom door before slipping into her one-piece bathing suit and Zach wondered about this sudden modesty.
After a couple minutes, he tapped on the door.
"Yes?"
"You O.K.?"
The door swung partway open.
"Couldn't be better," she said as she stepped back and pulled on her shorts over the bathing suit and tucked in the pale blue T-shirt.
"Why?"
He took two strides forward and hugged her with all his strength.
"Because I love you."
"Not too tight," she said and squirmed in his embrace.
He relaxed his arms but kept them loosely wrapped around her.
"And I also do as I'm told."
She laughed.
"Then you won't throw me in the water if I'm not ready?"
He reached down, grabbed her around the hips, and tossed her over his shoulder.
"What about when you are ready?"
He carried her into the kitchen then the living room as if prowling around for some body of water to toss her in.
She giggled into his shoulder and lightly pounded on his back with her fists.
"Zach, let me down," she cried though, like the long-ago schoolgirl she once again was, she hoped against her plea that this frisky boy would never set her down.
The double-wide shoe-horned between two behemoth pines was adequate to their needs--a place to park the car, stow their lunch, pee, freshen up.
But the tidy sandy beach on a picturesque cove and the clear cool water sparkling under the blue skies and bright sun--that was far better than they'd expected or dared to hope.
It certainly wasn't the ocean--lacking the waves, the incessant sound of surf, the salt-scent, the pesky gulls--but it was darned good enough, in some ways even better than the ocean--calmer, more private, no human visible along the tree-dotted shoreline undulating in either direction: a human-scale big-water shore, only without the humans.
What more could they ask for?
Zach posed that exact question to Becca after they'd spread their blanket then towels on the white imported sand, after she'd laid down on her stomach in the sun on one of those towels and he'd taken a quick swim in the cool but not cold water, doing a series of backward somersaults in the clear water then reversing his spin and doing a longer series of forward somersaults, glimpsing the sun at the peak of each loop before descending again into the dim deep to rise to the sun, time and again, embracing with youthful joy the water and the sun and the day and his life.
"What more could we ask for?"
he said to her and the blue dominated setting after sitting on the other towel with his arms resting on his wet knees and staring across their small cove and into the broad channel to the trees on the far side.
Becca closed the paperback Dune and laid the side of her face on the warm towel, looking up at him with one eye open, the other hidden below.
"For time to stop."
He thought about that a minute then nodded slowly.
"How long?"
"Oh, about a thousand years."
"Then we resume where we left off?"
"No.
We're a thousand years smarter.
The world's a thousand years better."
"Or worse."
Becca closed her one eye and nestled her face into the soap-scented towel backed by the soft blanket backed by the soft sand.
"Don't say that, Zach; don't even think it," she whispered into the towel.
Zach turned around and lay on his stomach beside her, let his face slowly slide along the soft cloth till it came up against and nuzzled her lotion-scented neck.
"Will your skin be a thousand years drier?"
"Mmmm," she cooed.
"Mummy-dried skin with sunk-in cheeks and a sharp-edged jaw with big yellow teeth sticking out under dark holes for eyes."
Zach lapped lightly at the moist and incredibly soft skin beside his lips.
"Then you know what I think?"
"What?"
she said, her face still buried in the towel.
"Before you freeze time for a thousand years--" "Yes?"
"The one thing we absolutely must do--" "Whisper it to me, Mr. Always Horny and Can't Ever Get Enough."
"Is roll your twenty-two year old body over--" "Yes," she cooed as he slid his hands under her thighs and breasts and gently rolled her over.
"And slide my twenty-four year old hands here--" He slid one hand up under her butt as she raised her thighs slightly to give him better access.
"O.K."
"And here--" And slid his other hand up under her shoulders and around her neck.
"I like where this is heading."
"And I lower my face to your young and warm and expectant lips--" "Sounds better by the minute," she said, her eyes closed the whole time.
"And just before I touch my lips to your soft ruby-colored lips of youth and vitality--" "Yes."
"I pass my lips close to your ear--" "Tell me."
"And whisper that if we're going to be frozen for a thousand years--" "Mm-hmm."
"Then I might as well say--" "I'm waiting."
"It's time to--" "Please."
"Throw you in the water whether you're ready or not!"
She screamed as he picked her up and cradled her in his arms and ran best he could across the narrow beach and splashed out into the water still holding her and stumbled and splashed still holding her, refusing to let her go and Becca screaming and laughing hysterically the whole time till he finally stopped in chest-deep water still holding her in his arms and her screams and laughter stopped as her lips locked on his and simply wouldn't part from there as he spun slowly eyes closed in the brilliant flashing stars inside their heads and the one brilliant star outside their heads and the world of blue with seconds passing into minutes passing into a thousand years though their welded lips remained soft and pliant the whole time.
Chapter 19
Becca woke with a start in the middle of the night and grabbed the receiver of the phone and pulled it to her ear.
"Hello."
"Me-bec!"
She sat bolt upright.
"What's the matter, Jonah?"
she shouted into the phone.
"Me-bec--."
The line went dead.
"Jonah?"
Becca shouted into the receiver.
"Jonah!"
A dial tone filled the silence in her ear.
Becca jumped out of bed without turning on the light and started to pull on the jeans she'd draped over the chair before going to bed.
"What's up, Bec?"
Zach said sleepily, his head still in the pillow.
"It's Jonah.
Something's wrong."
Zach sat up and scrubbed at his eyes.
"What's wrong?"
"I don't know.
He just said my name then hung up or had the phone taken away.
I don't know, Zach.
Something's wrong."
She tried to put on the T-shirt by feel and got it backwards.
"Can I please turn on the light?"
she shouted.
"Sure, Bec.
Go ahead."
By now he was out of the bed and moving around to where she was standing in front of the dresser in the dark.
The lamp on the nightstand came on with a blinding brilliance.
Becca had her jeans on and a bra and quickly straightened the T-shirt and slid it on over her head and arms.
Zach came around and slid between her and the dresser.
He put his hands on her shoulders and tried to fix on her eyes with his still somewhat clouded by sleep.
"Calm down, Becca.
Tell me what happened."
She took a deep breath.
"It was Jonah on the phone.
He said my name twice then the line went dead.
He sounded terrified."
"How do you know it was him?"
"I recognized his voice, Zach.
I know his voice.
And he called me Me-bec."
Zach nodded.
"So what are you doing?"
He checked the clock on the nightstand.
It was 2:12.
"I'm going to Mrs. Brackett's."
"Whoa.
Whoa, Bec.
Wait a minute.
You can't go over there in the middle of the night."
"Why not?"
"That's a warzone after dark.
Besides, you don't even know if that's where he is."
"I don't know anywhere else to look."
Her hands and shoulders were shaking violently.
Zach hugged her then guided her to a seat on the edge of the bed.
"Sit here a minute.
Take a few deep breaths."
"We've got to do something, Zach."
"I know.
We will.
If you'll promise to stay put a minute, I'm going to call Mrs. Brackett's house."
Becca nodded.
"O.K."
She took a long deep breath and held it in her lungs before releasing it in a drawn-out exhalation.
Zach went to the kitchen and dialed Mrs. Brackett's number taped beside the wall phone.
He let the phone on the other end ring twelve times before hanging up, each plaintive ring like a groan of increasing intensity in his heart--not for Jonah or Mrs. Brackett but for Becca gasping behind him.
He returned to the bedroom.
"No answer."
"She says her phone sometimes doesn't work."
"If Jonah was calling from there, then it was working."
Becca nodded.
"So maybe he's not there."
Zach shrugged.
"Maybe not, but it's a place to start.
Even if he's not there, she might know where he is."
He took his jeans off the hook on the closet door and put them on.
"Maybe we should call the police," Becca said.
"And tell them what?
That you think you got a call from a boy no relation to you and he might be in trouble but we don't know where he is or what kind of trouble?"
Becca nodded.
"So what should we do?"
"I'll drive by Mrs. Brackett's house."
"Zach--."
Zach raised his hand to stop her protest.
"I won't even get out of the truck if there's any hint of trouble.
I'll just drive by and take a look.
In the meantime, you keep trying her number and stay near the phone in case Jonah calls again."
"And I'm just sitting here waiting?"
"You're here if Jonah calls.
You're trying Mrs. Brackett's number."
"And if you don't come back?"
"If I'm not back in half an hour, or call you from Mrs. Brackett's to say everything is O.K., call the police and send them over there."
Becca nodded.
"I hate sending you out there.
It's not your fight."
"It's ours," he said as he finished tying his work boots.
She nodded in resignation.
"Be careful," she said, not rising from her seat on the bed, feeling all but paralyzed with fear and confusion and doubt.
"Always am," he said.
He leaned across the bed and kissed the top of her head.
"I love you."
"You too," she said, barely a whisper.
Chapter 20
The street was totally deserted and totally dark.
In all his earlier visits, Zach had failed to notice the lack of streetlights, but now their absence was all too apparent and ominous as he turned off the paved road.
He down-shifted into first gear--a creeper gear designed for fieldwork--and the truck moved forward at a crawl.
Not only was the street dark but so were all the houses.
This made sense for the numerous structures that were boarded up or vacant, but even the occupied ones were not marked by even a nightlight's glow.
He tried to remember which houses were occupied then realized he couldn't.
This late at night, they were all the same.
To a carload of punks driving by with guns pointed or bricks to throw, they were all equal, all dead and deserted.
He slowly approached Mrs. Brackett's house on one side, Snake's on the other.
Both were dark.
He wished his headlights had a wider spread so he could better see around each house, but their glow only reached a little ways off the road and showed nothing along the houses' sides or back yards.
To get a fuller view, he'd have to angle the truck in the road and shine his lights directly at the house; and he chose not to disrupt the peace and quiet of the setting through such an aggressive action, an action that might prompt a call to the police or a volley of gunshots.
He reached the dead end of the road a quarter-mile farther on, littered with more trash than the county landfill and looking especially forsaken in the limited reach of the truck's lights.
He turned around, careful not to run over a discarded mattress, and headed back the way he'd come at the same creeping speed.
As he came up on Mrs. Brackett's house from the other side, the bedroom side, he was praying to see some glimmer of light through those gable-end windows.
But there was nothing.
He could barely make out the end of the house from the surrounding night.
Then he recalled how Becca had said Jonah's windows were all taped over with dark paper.
There's no way he'd know from outside if anyone were inside.
As he crept past the house, his first thought was to keep going, drive on home and wait for morning--it wasn't but a few hours away--to try to sort this all out.
But then he imagined Becca's face after telling her he hadn't found Jonah and didn't even know if he were at Mrs. Brackett's or not.
He couldn't bear that sadness, that confusion, that desperation.
He directed the creeping truck to the side of the road just beyond the house, the spot where he and Becca always parked when visiting, though facing the opposite direction and in dark black as pitch now.
He switched off the engine and cut the lights.</pre>

                    <pre>"But there is not much we can do, we have to go."
"If you must go," Silas said, "then stay as far to the north away from Saragon as you can.
No one was sure if the Empire would stop at Saragon or push further north."
"We will, I promise," he assured them.
He turned his attention to the vacant-eyed younger children.
"Now who would like to hear a silly song about a bunny?"
They perked up at that, at least the younger two did.
One of them said very timidly, "I do."
So James began to sing.
"Little bunny Foo Foo hopping through the forest..."
While he sang, he pantomimed the little bunny hopping along with the rest of the cast of characters.
For the remainder of the evening he sang all the old silly songs he once sung as a child and even threw in a couple of poems.
The children sat in rapt attention and after the first two songs, began to smile a little and even clapped along.
The adults, seeing life return to their children, clapped along as well with tears in their eyes.
Eventually, James' voice cracked and he had to stop for a while.
Miko, surprisingly, began a song about a lord who couldn't find his slippers.
It was a silly song, but one that the children had heard before because they sang along with him after the first chorus.
The rest of the night was full of singing and silly tales.
For a time at least, the memories of what happened and what their futures might hold were forgotten.
All that mattered this night was that they had brought joy back to the children.
The following morning when the sky began to lighten, even before the sun rose over the mountain peaks, James and Miko made ready to get through the Pass.
Silas, Bellon and their families gathered around, shaking hands.
Silas' wife even went so far as to give James a kiss.
"Thank you so much for last night," she said with tears in her eyes.
"I wish you all well," James said as he mounted his horse with Miko following suit.
James reached into his shirt and pulled out a bag of coins, tossing it toward Silas who caught it.
"Take this and start a new life."
"We can't accept this," Silas said and made to hand it back.
"No, you keep it," James said, refusing to take it.
"I have plenty of money.
What good is it if you can't use it to help out your fellow man?"
"How can I ever repay your generosity?"
"Before the year is out, help two people who are less fortunate than you," James explained.
"Also, ask them each to help two people within a year.
Start a chain of giving, who knows where it might lead."
When all was ready he and Miko mounted up.
"We will," said Bellon.
The rest of the adults agreed.
James reached down and shook hands with Bellon and Silas, "Good bye now, and good luck."
"May the gods speed you on your way," Silas said.
"And be careful," his wife added.
With a final wave, James and Miko headed toward the summit and into Madoc.
Behind them, James heard one of the little girls begin to sing, "Little bunny Foo Foo..."
With a tear beginning to well in his eye, he hurried along toward the way stop.
They didn't get far before they were once again challenged by a soldier, a different one than the day before.
"Travelers are not allowed beyond the way stop."
"We can take care of ourselves," James assured him.
"Be that as it may, my orders are clear.
No one, and I mean no one, is to be allowed to endanger themselves by traveling into the Madoc area."
He stood and barred their way, staring at them.
"What if we just ride around you and go anyway?"
"Then the soldiers further east will stop you," the soldier explained.
"If you persist, they will arrest you and place you in jail for your own safety until you realize that it's not safe for you to go there."
"Damn!"
James muttered under his breath.
Turning his horse around, he headed back toward the west.
As they returned, they found that Silas and Bellon had already returned to the refugee area with their families.
James glanced at Miko who was looking at him with a questioning look on his face.
"Don't ask me!"
he said.
"I wasn't," Miko replied innocently.
"I am simply waiting patiently to find out what we are going to do now."
Smiling, he looked at James.
"I don't know.
I certainly don't want to waste the time backtracking all the way to Trademeet and then go north through the Dragon's Pass.
That will add days to our travel time."
"Why don't you use that compass thing of yours," suggested Miko.
"It might just be time to do that," James agreed.
"Good idea."
Miko beamed at the praise.
They returned to the spot where they spent the night.
They dismounted and James removed the compass from his backpack.
He sat as far from the road as he could with his back to the rock wall.
Motioning Miko over he said, "This may take a while, so make sure I am not disturbed.
And remember, we don't want anyone to find out I can do magic, alright?"
"Alright," agreed Miko as he took his position a little closer to the road.
James settled down and held the compass in his hands on his lap, beginning to tap into the magic.
He concentrated on finding a way through the mountains that he and Miko would be able to travel, one which will avoid the soldiers who patrolled the road.
He concentrated harder and harder and then felt the magic surge forth when he released it.
To James, it felt as if the magic was expanding from him in a spherical radius, causing ever increasing amounts to be drawn from him while searching every nook and cranny of the mountain for the elusive path.
The spell continued to draw large amounts of power from him.
After a short time, he started to feel the effects.
His head throbbed and his breathing became more labored.
Yet still the spell wasn't finished.
He had not yet found a path through the mountains.
Suddenly, the flow of power eased as the powers began to merge and flow in a more singular direction like a pack of dogs that caught the scent of a fox.
Then all of a sudden it was over and the needle of the compass pointed westward, back toward Trademeet.
Opening his eyes, James saw where the compass pointed and sighed.
Miko heard him and asked, "Did it work?"
"Yes," James replied, "but it's pointing back the way we came."
He showed the compass to Miko.
"Is it directing us toward Dragon's Pass?"
"I don't know, though we may have little choice."
Getting up, he had a sudden dizzy spell and briefly lost his balance.
Miko saw him falter and put James' arm around his shoulder.
After a few steps and several deep breaths, he began to feel better.
He then removed his arm from around Miko's neck.
"I'm okay.
It's passed."
"Too big a spell again?"
James nodded.
"I think so, but I seem to be better able in handling the effects."
He mounted his horse and they turned to follow the direction indicated by the compass.
Several hours later and still following the compass, they arrived at the plateau where the old abandoned keep stood.
When the keep came into view, the compass swung toward it.
"Great!"
James heard Miko exclaim when he realized where the compass pointed.
"Somehow I knew we'd be going in there."
"I had my suspicions too," James admitted.
Thinking the way may be further down the plateau and not at the old keep, James angled them to go around its left side.
But when they passed the entrance, the compass turned and pointed toward the opened front door.
He showed the compass to Miko with a grin.
Shrugging, he turned his horse toward the entrance and dismounted.
James peered through the slight opening made by the door being ajar, but couldn't make out anything in the dim light.
Turning back to Miko he said, "Let's secure the horses around back and then investigate.
We don't want anyone coming by and helping themselves while we are in there."
They walked the horses around to the back where they secured them.
James took his backpack and they returned to the entrance.
He paused a moment then asked Miko, "Want to go first?"
"No," replied Miko, a little nervous.
"Alright then, I'll go first."
James stepped up and slowly made his way through the doorway, passing into a poorly lit room.
He made his glowing orb and the light from it revealed a large room with several doors and two hallways that led from it.
The compass indicated they should take the hallway directly opposite the door.
He walked to the hallway.
As he entered, the light from the orb revealed something large lying across the floor not three feet from where he stood.
As he moved closer he discovered it was a dead body in the latter stages of decomposition.
The clothing on the man, at least he thought it was a man, was in pretty bad shape but looked as if it had been of good quality.
Miko saw the dead body illuminated by the orb and gasped.
"James, we shouldn't be in here," he said with a tremor of fear in his voice.
"Let's find another way."
"Don't be scared," he said reassuringly.
"It's only a dead body."
He leaned down and grabbed a stick.
He began to poke through the dead man's clothes.
"Most likely this was a merchant traveling through the Pass that ran afoul of bandits and they dumped his body in here.
See, look, there is no purse on him, nothing at all of value."
James used the stick and turned the head.
"And look," he said indicating the back of the head, "it's cracked like someone hit him in the head with something hard."
"Maybe the bandits are still here?"
Miko said worriedly, looking around.
"Not likely," he replied.
"If they were still using this place, they would hardly have left a dead body rotting in the hallway.
They would have dumped it out back where they wouldn't have had to walk over it and smell it."
"I suppose you're right," admitted Miko, though still not very reassured.
"So relax, we're going to be okay."
"If you say so," Miko replied halfheartedly.
Leaving the body behind, they continued down the hallway, passing two doors before coming to a halt before the third.
"Why are you stopping?"
"It's indicating that we need to go through this door," he explained.
He tried the handle but found it locked.
He handed the compass and glowing orb to Miko before throwing his weight against the door.
With a crash, the door burst in, breaking off a two foot section of the doorjamb in the process.
His momentum carried him a little ways through the door where he stumbled and fell.
He rolled down a flight of stairs and came to rest at the bottom.
Bruised and scraped but otherwise unhurt, he got to his feet.
At the top of the steps he saw Miko illuminated by the glow from the orb looking down at him.
"Are you okay?"
the boy asked.
"Yeah," replied James, "come on down.
But be careful, I might have broken a few of the steps during my fall."
Being extra careful, Miko took it one step at a time, skipping over a few broken ones.
He finally made it to the bottom.
It was a small room, only about ten feet by maybe twelve.
The only exit was the door at the top of the stairs.
The room itself was empty except for the dust that had accumulated over time.
James retrieved the compass from Miko and sure enough, it was still pointing the way.
This time it indicated the direction they needed to go was through the wall.
Pointing to the wall indicated by the compass, he said, "It says that we are to go this way."
"Another secret door like in Lord Colerain's estate?"
Nodding his head, James replied, "I think so, give me the orb for a second."
Holding out his hand, Miko passed him the orb.
He did a thorough inspection of the wall and failed to find anything that looked like it could be a trigger to open the secret door.
He then moved to the adjoining walls, searching for some trigger or other mechanism that could possibly open a secret door.
Miko looked around and noticed a design on the floor, partially hidden by the accumulated dust.
"James, look at this."
James knelt to take a closer look.
Brushing away the dust he discovered a square shaped stone engraved with a design of a circle within a circle within a circle.
He applied pressure to it but nothing happened.
Getting to his feet, he had Miko step on it while he pushed on the wall but nothing happened.
"Maybe there are others we need to release first," he theorized.
"Look around for any more similar designs."
Miko discovered a second one on the wall about midway up the stairs.
This one was a single circle.
Excited, James said, "If there is one with three circles and another with just the one, then there may be another with two.
And hopefully by pressing them in the correct order, it'll enable us to open the secret door."
"Makes sense," agreed Miko.
They looked but failed to find two circles, one in the other.
"I don't think there is one here," Miko said after they had searched for a while.
"There has to be," he insisted.
"It wouldn't make any sense otherwise."
He got on his hands and knees to closely examine the floor inch by inch.
"But we've examined all the walls and floor over and over," Miko went on.
"There is no such design here."
Standing up suddenly, James looked at Miko, "You're right.
We have searched all the walls and the floor, but we haven't looked at the ceiling."
He turned his gaze upward and sure enough, there was the design with two circles, one inside the other.
"I knew it!"
he exclaimed excitedly.
"Miko, go and press firmly on the single circle."</pre>
