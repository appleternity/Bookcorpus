        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <h4>Story 1</h4>
                    <pre>Meri sighed and started following him.
Henry took a look over his shoulder to make sure that nothing had tried to sneak up on them while they were stopped.
Satisfied that nothing was coming, he followed the rest.
They carefully and cautiously approached the delivery vehicle.
The group of survivors got in line with the car, Dennis got down on one knee and looked under the truck to see if the could see bodies or signs that there might be some activity on the other side.
Dennis grimaced as he stood up, still a little sore from slipping into the pool of blood getting off the bus.
Standing up, Dennis put his hands on the small of his back and leant back stretching out his tight muscles.
"This is going to hurt tomorrow," Dennis says out loud, as he hunched his shoulders forward.
"If we survive that long."
He muttered to himself.
"See anything?"
Henry whispers to Dennis.
"No, there was nothing to see.
There appears to be another vehicle turned on its side pressed up against this truck.
Other than that, it looks OK."
"Do you hear that?"
Meri says from behind the two men.
"What's that buzzing noise?"
Henry stands still and holds his breath for a minute to listen to the sound.
"I hear it too."
Henry listens to the noise for a minute longer.
The sound appears to be coming from all around the group, it seems like it's coming from the front of the truck, the back of the truck and inside the truck.
"Do you hear bees?"
Meri asks.
"No," Dennis responds.
"That's live wires.
Do not touch either of the vehicles or poles, if you want to live to see tomorrow."
Dennis goes first through the two vehicles, being a tall man he has to duck underneath of the pole.
As he walks under the pole, he is looking up at it making sure there are no hidden wires before he motions the others through.
On the other side of the pole, he stands up straight again and faces the others.
"OK.
Come on through."
Meri is frozen in her tracks as two zombies stand up by the front fender and make their way towards Dennis' back.
She sticks her arm out straight and points past him trying to mutter any words.
Dennis sees her pointing and trying to say something and immediately raises his crowbar out of instinct and recoils a little seeing two of them so close.
He swung his crowbar across in front of him and catching the first zombie in the chin, the crowbar got trapped in the dead man's bone, and the force of the swing throws it to the ground.
Dennis stomped on its head and yanks the bar out to get ready for the other one but is surprised to see it standing there just out of Dennis' swing zone.
"Guys, we have a problem."
Henry piped up from beside the still horrified Meri.
Dennis looked up to see a group of six other zombies coming around the corner of the delivery van and walking towards Meri and Henry.
Immediately Henry recognised one of the zombies in the front as the mechanic that found him in the woods this morning downtown.
Trevor had a few rough cuts and scrapes along his cheeks, and most of his coveralls were torn from trying to get over the razor wire fence on the other side of the highway.
"What the hell."
Henry stammers backwards, bumping into Meri who turns to see the group.
"Run!"
Dennis screamed at them.
Henry turned toward Dennis and grabbed Meri by the shoulders to turn her in the direction that he needs her to go.
"Move. Move. Move." Henry said as he's helping her along.
Henry reached up with his free hand and pushed Meri's head down as they get closer to the light pole.
Dennis took a step forward and swung the bar toward the still zombie catching it in the temple.
The zombie dropped to the ground instantly as Henry and Meri go running past him.
Dennis turned around to see the first zombie approaching the pole and hit it with his face.
The zombie convulsed from the amount of electricity running through its body.
Stopping beside the zombie was the old man in the fedora hat that Henry had seen in the parking lot, he had stopped too close to the body of the electrically charged one, and its flailing hand reached out touched the old man's arm.
Both zombies began to dance uncontrollably in the parking intersection.
Dennis backed up as the first zombie fell to the ground taking the other one with it since they became fused together.
Chapter Sixteen
Henry crossed the intersection and ran up the embankment on the other side.
He turned around and pressed his back against the cold touch of the brick building.
Meri was huffing beside him as she turned and placed her hand against the wall while spitting on the ground.
"You should not spit," Henry said as she looked up at him.
"It's only going to dehydrate you faster."
Meri did not have the strength to reach out to give him the finger, and she did not have the breath to tell him what to do with his food.
She just looked back to the ground trying to regain her composure.
Henry looked out at the road and saw the zombies moving uncontrollably as the pole electrocuted them.
"I'm glad we did not touch that pole then."
Henry said, "I almost had to reach up to catch myself when Dennis almost hit me in the face with that crowbar."
Meri turned towards the intersection as another body fell to the ground.
He watched as the zombie dressed in the mechanic uniform then bent at the waist and stepped up to it's two fallen companions.
His face never losing focus as it walked forward, all of its attention was on Dennis.
They both watched speechless as the mechanic bent down and walked underneath of the pole.
"Run!"
Meri screamed at Dennis.
Dennis looked over his shoulder quickly and saw that Meri and Henry had their backs pressed against the back of the brick building.
He returned his focus to the zombies that were making their way towards him.
The mechanic and a woman wearing a puffy fur coat had managed to make it underneath of the pole.
Behind them, two more had ducked down underneath of it with another three waiting in the background.
One of the men walking under the pole currently was taller than the others, and he did not duck enough to make it clearly through.
The clothes that he was wearing started to smoulder from the direct contact with the metal pole.
Dennis smiled briefly as he was backing up across the road, never taking his eyes from his pursuers.
Behind the first two zombies, the larger zombie suddenly burst into flames.
The zombie had fallen to the ground and continued to crawl across the ground.
"I guess it's stronger than the others.
That's not a good thing."
Dennis said to himself.
Dennis peered around the lady in the fur coat in enough time to see the large zombie get back to its feet covered in flames.
With every step that the zombie took a trail of melted rubber was left on the road from the creatures shoes.
The large strides of this zombie gave it the appearance of walking faster than the others, it also allowed the zombie to catch up with the first two zombies.
The flaming man bumped into the lady wearing the fur coat which instantly began to smoulder and burn.
Within seconds the faux fur coat began to drip liquid fire onto the road.
Dennis could start to smell the burning flesh as they inched closer.
"We have to do something!"
Meri screamed as she turned to Henry.
"We cannot just leave him there."
She reached over to Henry and grabbed his arms and shook him.
"Let me think a second."
He said as he shoved her hands off of his arms.
Henry looked over at the man that had saved his life probably twice already today, and if he could find a way to help him, he'd probably protect him a few more times before the sun went down.
"Fuck it."
Henry put the bottle of water on the ground beside Meri.
"Stay here.
And if it goes wrong, run like you've never run before for the Wholesale store."
Henry turned his attention back towards Dennis who was getting closer to the embankment, he was no longer looking where he was going.
Henry knew he was leading towards him to keep Meri safe.
The rest of the zombies had managed to get through the obstacle and were starting to surround Dennis.
Henry took a deep breath and started running down the hill, towards a fight.
Something he had never done previously in his life.
Henry raised his hammer in his right hand as he started running up the embankment and towards the group of zombies that begun to surround Dennis.
Dennis slowly started reaching his left hand behind his back while his right hand was waving the crowbar back and forth to keep the group of zombies at bay.
His hand fumbled with the edge of his shirt as he reached for his gun.
The one thing that Dennis knew that no one else did is that he had only one bullet in his gun and he was going to use it to end his own life to give his new friends a chance to escape.
Dennis' fingers felt the cool handle of the gun, and his breathing slowed down knowing that this torment would soon be over.
"I'm coming!"
Henry yelled as his feet hit the pavement running as fast as he could.
"On your right!"
This was a familiar phrase that he used a lot while running on the trails and streets by his house to let walkers know where he was when he was overtaking them.
Henry had hoped that Dennis knew this phrase.
Dennis heard the footsteps coming up behind him.
They were coming too fast to be another zombie laying an ambush.
Hearing Henry's warning triggered an urgency within Dennis, he realised that he was not quite ready to put his life down right now.
He had people to take care of and people who were going to take care of him.
Dennis released his grip on the handle of the gun and put both hands on the bottom of the crowbar and sneered "Let's dance."
Henry came whistling by Dennis' right shoulder faster than he could have anticipated but he was not running by him, he was sailing through the air after he had jumped from just behind Dennis.
Henry had made a last minute decision that the towering flaming zombie had to be the first one to be taken down.
That was the one that posed the greatest threat to everyone.
He knew that running directly at the man was a bad idea as he could be tangled in his arms or burned by the heat of the flames.
Henry aimed his body for the small opening between the tall man and the lady wearing the fur coat.
He swung his hammer down on the top of the man's skull and caved it in with a resounding wet thud.
The momentum of his body flying through the air pulled the man over and knocked two more of the group down at the same time.
Henry hit the ground still running and make a sharp turn ready to take on the rest of the crowd.
Some of the group had turned to face him, and that left Dennis with the mechanic, the lady wearing the fur coat and a pre-teen girl wearing a mini-skirt.
Henry felt bad for what was about to happen knowing that they used to be people too.
He did not have much time to worry about it as the two zombies knocked down by the tall man were starting to get up.
Henry almost did not see the little old lady coming at him from the right until her arthritic fingers tried to grab his arm.
He turned his body towards her and gave her a solid kick to her stomach as she brought her mouth closer to his arm.
The force of the kick knocked the dentures from her lips, and she tumbled to the ground, even in death her hands did not have much use anymore.
He jogged over to her and put his foot on her head, turning her eyes away from his body and brought the claw end of the hammer down jamming it in between her eyes with an audible crack.
Henry wretched a little and almost passed out from what he had just done when he hear the growling noise coming from behind him.
He turned quickly to notice that the pair advancing on him were identical twins.
Without even thinking about it, Henry was trying to decide who was the older of the two women, it was always a game that he liked to play with his mother on the summer days they spent travelling through the city when he was younger.
The woman on the left was wearing a business suit with a grey top, while her sister was dressed in a flower pattern dress.
Even with this much damage and blood on their faces, it was hard to mistake their relationship.
"I think you're the older one," Henry said as he pointed to the woman on the left.
"So, you should go first."
Henry took a few running steps before jumping towards the older of the twins.
He brought his hammer down with more force than before since these girls looked fresher than the others.
Henry's arm swung through the air and connected with nothing.
The woman had ducked to the right and avoided his attack.
He landed on the ground a few feet away and quickly turned to see the younger twin lunging for him.
He took a step backwards out of shock and narrowly managed to avoid the woman's hands as they tried to grasp his shirt.
He brought his hammer upwards hoping to be able to catch the woman off guard and regain his advantage.
His hammer connected with the woman's throat as she fell to the ground, her body was heavier than he was expecting and the hammer slipped from his hand.
Henry looked as her body landed on the ground with her arms stretched out towards him.
The hammer sticking out from underneath.
He bent down quickly and pulled on the handle trying to dislodge it from her head as her sister approached him.
Henry struggled with the hammer, the fall had lodged the claw end of the hammer in the woman's spinal cord, severing it.
Her mouth continued to open and close as her limbs no longer worked.
The woman in the suit approached him with a sense of urgency, knowing that Henry was unable to defend himself, she snarled at him and reached out for him.
A blindingly fast object scraped his ear and the woman's head exploded out the back of her body and fell to the ground.
A loud explosion recoiled beside Henry's face, and he slammed his hands on top of his ears.
Henry looked over his shoulder to see Dennis holding the smoking gun in one hand.
Henry fell to his knees, landing on top of the still biting lady in the flower dress, and started to have a mild panic attack.
His heart was racing, and he was unable to control his breathing, he was on the verge of hyperventilating.
Henry could barely hear anything his eyes darted around the pavement trying to keep himself from passing o
A clang beside him startle him, and he looked over to see the crowbar sticking out of the back of the head of the woman he was kneeling on.
Dennis stood with his hand out.
"Come on, we cannot stay here for long."
Henry took the man's hand and was helped back to his feet.
Dennis bent down and pulled the hammer from the dead woman and gave it back to Henry.
"Thanks for that.
I did not think I was going to make it."
He looked over his shoulder to see Meri sitting on the ground next to the building.
"To be honest, I was saving that bullet for myself if things went terribly.
You saved my life right now."
Henry looked a Dennis and then over to the building.
"Do not worry, I won't tell her about it."
Nodding towards the gun.
"Besides, I was just returning the favour, I'm pretty sure you saved my life a couple of times today already, and the day is not even half over yet."
Henry took the hammer from Dennis and wiped it on the dress of the woman.
"These things are smart."
He looked towards the woman in the suit that Dennis had shot.
"That one ducked my attack when I jumped at her."
Dennis looked back towards the hill where there was a pile body smouldering somewhere behind him.
"Yeah, I do not like this at all.
That mechanic was probably the worst of them all.
He actually stood back and tried to walk around me while I was fending off the other two."
They walked back towards the building, and Henry noticed the bodies were laying on top of one another on the bottom of the embankment.
"I did say tried to ambush me.
I swept the group all into the ditch with the crowbar, and they landed on top of one another.
That old lady caught them all on fire, and so it made it easy for me to spike them in the head all at once."
Henry stopped to look down at the mechanic.
Dennis noticed him looking at the man.
"What's up with that one?
You recognise him?"
"Yeah, I do."
said Henry.
"He works on your car before or something?"
Dennis asked looking at Henry.
"No, nothing like that.
That one tried to kill me this morning and has apparently been following me since then."</pre>

                    <h4>Story 2</h4>
                    <pre>The only worry he had now was the concern that there might be wild cards hiding out there somewhere... but attention to detail was HIS edge over those wanting to take his power away... and he was sure he had covered all the bases he knew about... it was the unknowns that could cause problems, and that's why he made it his business to know EVERYTHING!
Only this time he HAD missed something... one of those unknowns... it had not gone on official records yet... only three people knew at this point and one of them was the judge who had signed the court order... it was a matter of timing. ...
The phone on Dave's desk was ringing while Dave and Berry just keep standing there staring at each other... it had only been a half hour since they had left the Chief's office and both were thinking the same thing... maybe something went wrong... it was too soon for him to have talked to the DA... maybe his meeting with the Mayor went badly and he was canceling his offer to help... they were both so wrapped up in things that could possibly go wrong with this case that neither of them were thinking very positively.
When Dave finally picked up the phone he was anticipating bad news.
After a long pause a smile began to grow across Dave's face.
Berry exhaled a sigh of relief... he could tell it was GOOD news.
After a few more seconds of listening to the caller, Dave finally responded.
We'll be down to the Task Force office shortly... we can listen to the recording and you fill me in on the details then... he hung up the phone and turned to Berry... timing again... it appears that the task force just placed a legal wire tap on a suspected crime family boss, and they have just gotten a recording of a phone conversation that is very interesting.... want to have a listen? ...
The Joint Organized Crime Task Force Initiative was mandated and funded by a State Senate Bill 9027.43B that had been introduced by a lobby group made up of police chiefs and law enforcement officials within the state... and it had been endorsed by the Mayors of each city it was to be established in.
The State Bureau of Investigation was tasked with building each city's organization.
Most of them were established in a location that appeared to be a business in order to keep a cover over the real activities going on within.
The local task force was not much different.
They had acquired a building near Warehouse Row.
When Dave pulled up to the location Berry noticed that there were several cars in the parking lot, and there was a large sign above the door that said "Simmons Imports".
Who's Simmons?
Berry smiled widely as he spoke to Dave.
There actually is a Simmons... he runs the front... in case anyone does actually come in to do business... it appears just like a import business... front counter, cash register... complete with a Mr. Simmons as the proprietor... he's actually an SBI agent working with the task force...
Entering the building Berry followed Dave around the counter and through the door Dave had opened going to the back.
The ceiling was much higher and it was much wider than the front.
The area extended back at least a hundred fifty to two hundred feet.
As soon as he entered the main operations area, Berry made note of the recognized technology the task force had employed.
Around two walls to his left were situated a grouping of large screen and projection type displays.
In the center of the room there were a number of rows of cubicles, each including at least two computers and several display screens.
The far end of the area housed a raised platform extending out from the wall about 25 feet.
It ran from one wall completely to the other.
The raised area was enclosed with glass walls extending to the ceiling in front and it contained various items of electronic surveillance and recording equipment that appeared to be controlled from a central panel.
Berry noticed there were several rolling chars situated around the floor in glassed in area, but currently only one of them was occupied, and it's user seemed to be focused on the control panel until he turned to see Dave and Berry crossing the room.
Berry continued to follow Dave over to the platform, up the steps, and through the plate glass door the occupant had opened for them.
This is Benny...
We call him Benny Goodman because he's a real good man with all this stuff...
Johnson, Benny Johnson... he held out his hand toward Berry.
Berry was much into shaking hand but he responded in kind.
I'm Berry...
Berry Sullivan, I know...
I probably know more about you that you do yourself... it's my job you know...
Berry's look showed that he was very uncomfortable.
He started to respond rather rebelliously when he was cut off.
Hey, I'm just kiddin... a little eaves-dropping humor... all I know about you is what I have read in the papers, and what Dave here has told me... nice to meet ya Berry.
Benny's huge honest smile showed that he really was just kidding.
Nice to meet you too Benny, I'll be sure to be more careful what I say over the phone from now on.
Berry's smile showed he was attempting a little humor of his own.
I don't have a wire tap on you that I know of... unless of course it's under an alias...
Benny's smile returned the tort.
Dave interrupted their little banter.
So what have you got Benny?
We just receive an ok for a wire tap and I had finished setting it up when I got a flag... there's this algorithm that determines hits and using a percentage of key words that are run through an AI for voice recognition it then localizes the voice command words...
Berry probably understood every word you said, but for a computer illiterate person like me, you're going to need to put it into everyday terms I can understand.
Dave was a little annoyed.
OK, here's the deal... my equipment caught a conversation between an unknown and someone we just obtained a legal wire tap for... it was sort of a fluke... don't say anything, but I had already setup the tap, and was waiting on the order, when I decided to do some recording tests to make sure it was working ok.
Dave was getting anxious... bottom line?
Bottom line is that the equipment caught and flagged a conversation from the tap before I got the order, but after it had been signed by the judge... which makes it still legal and admissible... am I right?
I would say so... what's the conversation about?
That's why I called you... it has to do with the Loften murder, and since you're the lead detective on that one, I thought you should hear it... it's only audio you know... no video... that wasn't in the order.
You know...
I think it caught the conversation because there were a number of key words and phrases I programmed in specific to the organized crime figures in this area... might not have got it otherwise.
Benny was fishing for a complement.
He got it... that's great thinking Benny... the department will be sure to hear about this.
Berry joined in.
That's good computer thinking...
I can see why they put you in charge of this area.
Benny smiled from ear to ear and spun around in his chair.
Set down gentlemen, and have a listen... you're gonna love this! ...
Although the recording wasn't that long it contained a lot of information.
Dave and Berry had exited the glass room and were sitting in the cubicles discussing the implication of what they had heard.
The first thing I need to do is alert the department that they are planning an attempt to take out Vinnie... we need him to break this and we can't afford to let anything happen to him...
I probably need to get back to the department and make sure he's safe.
This conversation certainly gives us a reason to bring Sophia Grendandino in for questioning, and if we can get her to talk, maybe we can get to the bottom of all this.
Berry was about to respond when he felt his cell phone vibrating in his jacket pocket.
Taking it out he realized from the caller ID it was Dianne.
I need to take this call... hang on a second.
It didn't matter that they had just begun to discuss the recording... he had already decided a while back that he would not let his job get in the way for their relationship...
Hi, what's up?
Can you meet me for a late lunch?
I am famished... so hungry I could eat a cow...
The conversation seems odd to Berry.
They almost never met in the afternoons because that was usually her busiest time at the institute... and she usually didn't eat very much... and a cow?
She wasn't a vegan... not even a vegetarian... but she usually did not eat red meat.
Berry was somewhat careful with his response.
Sure I can do that... say in a half hour?
That would be great... we can meet at our usual place... you know... see you soon.
He was almost certain something was wrong now... she didn't give the name of the place they would meet, but instead called it their usual place... she had always referred to it as Gruderman's Deli because she liked the old couple that ran the place... he was sure she was being evasive on purpose so as not to say too much over the phone...
Dave, I need to step out for a bit myself... it was Dianne... she wants to meet me in thirty minutes... she was being very evasive over the phone... like she didn't want anyone to hear... it was sort of odd... maybe it has something to do with this case...
I did ask her to check into a few things for me...
Dave looked up at Berry.
I know what you're thinking but before you say it... no, she has no idea where this all goes... all she was doing was searching references...
I didn't tell her anything... but she's a very smart lady... who know what she's found out... maybe she just wants some advice on a class... either way I'll be back to the department as soon as I talk to her and we can continue this then. ...
When he arrived she was already there sitting on the far side of the parking lot in her car waiting for him.
She got out first and came over to his car.
We're going to talk while we are walking... look like this is just a normal conversation... and don't ask any questions until I am done....
This is IMPORTANT... now smile and act normal no matter what I say... because like you usually say, just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean someone isn't out to get you...
I have stumbled across some information that really scares me...
Berry tried to look normal and attempted a smile occasionally as Dianne told him what she had found out about the major donation to the institute that saved them... that it had actually came from a special think tank group that was run by a holding company with ties to someone who was very powerful.
She told him how she suspected that a liaison based in the institute who was placed there by the think tank was actually working for the holding company and was put there as a spy to discover information.
But it was when she mentioned a name that Berry almost chocked trying to keep from looking surprised.
Have you ever heard of a man named Agustus Rensillere?
Berry was quick to respond.
Holding his hand to the side of his head and appearing to scratch his cheek, he covered his mouth from prying eyes.
Don't say another word... just knowing that name could put you in jeopardy... we need to talk in private... be careful what you say... there are people who read lips... we need to go back to my car and go though the take out before we go for a little ride.
If we stay calm and look casual it will appear like we just changed our minds and decided to get carry out...
The look on Dianne's face was almost expressionless... she just stood still and stared at him for a second... then she spoke through closed lips as if she was a ventriloquist... you surh is saheh ta tauk in yer cah?
Don't worry... my car isn't bugged... you're looking at the king of electronic devices...
I always check it regularly... especially lately...and yes having paranoia doesn't mean you're not being watched... oh... and by the way... nice ventriloquist act.
He smiled as they turned to go back to his car... odd he was thinking about his little joke's timing right at the moment... he shouldn't be thinking about jokes with the seriousness of the situation... he made a mental note that Muffin's influence was beginning to rub off on him... at first he decided he should recheck him thinking... then he changed his mind... for the first time he realized why Muffin always looked at the humorous side... it was a good way to relieve the tension... maybe Muffin had the right idea after all! ...
While Berry was meeting with Dianne, Dave was busy following up on the recorded phone call they had listened to.
He had asked Benny to trace the other end of the call and analyze the recording for anything that stood out like background noise of something of the sort.
Dave was being careful and trying to cover all the details... it was getting to be almost more than he could handle in his mind... there were so many details to this case... so many factions involved... it was hard to imagine the entire scope of it all... it reminded him of some thriller novel that was currently pushing to the top of the best seller list... it had all the trappings of a mystery written to keep the reader on the edge of their seat... only this one was real life... and it involved real people's lives...
He had picked up something to eat on his way back to the office and had almost finished pounding it down when the Chief walked through the door.
Word is you have a recorded conversation that indicates they want to kill Balboa to keep him from talking... sounds like he might have something important to say after all...
He tossed a folder on Dave's desk....
I believe this is what you were wanting... it's a little more than even I expected...
I think the Mayor put some pressure on him... it looks like the DA's a politician too.
Thanks Chief ...
Don't thank me... just get the information from Balboa, put it all together, and make sure you have a case that will put the crime families out of business for good... that's what we're here for.
As the chief left the office Dave couldn't help thinking that Berry was right...
Chief Dobbin wasn't such a bad guy after all... he just wanted to see the city cleaned up like every other law abiding citizen... only he was in a position to do something about it and he wanted results.
Dave was resolved to give them to him... ...
CHAPTER 26 After getting their order from the drive up window, Berry headed towards the park.
He figured he could park his car under the trees along the parkway and they could eat while discussing the situation without being observed too closely.
Berry told Dianne what he had discovered about the power broker, his plan to move college sports to a semi-armature/semi-pro status league, the gambling aspect, and all the high level political angles... he was careful to leave out his sources but he pretty much gave her most of what he knew... he figured since she was already involved to a level that could endanger her life she had the right to know all the truth... at least as much of it as he knew about himself.
When he had finished his briefing, Dianne turned to him with a look of a loving friend.
You need to be careful too Berry... if he's gone to all this trouble to keep an eye on the Law Enforcement Institute, he probably has people in the department... how many people know all you've told me?
Besides Dave and me... and now you... that makes only the three of us that have all the facts as far as we know them... we haven't even told the Chief about the power broker angle and all the politics involved.
You may still be out of the radar scope on this one Berry... my suspensions were first aroused when I discovered that the think tank liaison had requested a copy of our records on all the law enforcement officials who are involved in our programs and all the paid staff working for the institute.
And that's when I realized that you name was never given to him... although your help has been invaluable, you are not a paid staff member and don't have an official position at the institute... so the information the liaison received never mentions you as being involved... that could be a plus for you... you still have the element of surprise going for you.
Well, there are a couple of things that could have put me on the radar beside my involvement with the institute... he was thinking not only about his involvement in the department but about his friendship with Muffin and Muffin's sources... but Muffin was always careful not to involve Berry in that part of it so maybe he was still off the screen.
Either way we need to proceed very cautiously and try not to get too emotional about all this... we need to keep a level head and give a show to anyone who might be watching... we want to tell them that nothing is wrong and we are just going about our normal business as usual... if we arouse any suspensions, it could be bad for both of us... oh and don't mention any of this to ANYONE no matter how much you trust them...
I want to keep this close...
I still don't know who we can trust... better to trust no one than trust the wrong person and... well you know what I mean.
He avoided being graphic so as not to disturb her more than he felt was necessary... he wanted her to feel safe.
When they returned to the deli lot where she had parked he pulled into the empty space next to her car.
I'll keep an eye on things and see what I can find out about this liaison...
I'm right here if you need me... don't hesitate to call if you get spooked...
I've got your back side... she smiled a big grin and winked at him...
I didn't mean it THAT way... well maybe I did ... either way you know what I mean... he winked back.
He felt it was better to keep a light note on the situation in order to help her feel more comfortable and not worry too much.
She planted a kiss on his cheek and got out ... she smiled back at him... somehow she DID feel safer knowing Berry was watching out for her. ...
Dave was just about to call Berry when he walked through the door of Dave's office.
There's been a development you need to know about.
There's been a couple of developments here at the department too... but you go first.
Berry closed the door before speaking.
It seems that our power broker has infiltrated the Law Enforcement Institute...
Dianne has come up with some information that indicated he has people in place there to keep an eye on things... and maybe here in the department too...
You need to know that after she told me about what she had found out, I filled her in on most all of the details...
I felt she needed to know so she could steer a solid course and keep from gaining too much attention...
I didn't want her to get involved, but she is already, and I don't want her to get hurt Dave...
So now that she knows that only make the three of us who have most all the pieces... it looks like it's a good thing we have keep some of these detail to ourselves...there are people working for whoever is behind this whole mess and it could get back to them... if too many people found out what we know... that could put a number of people's lives in danger...
Dave nodded telling Berry he understood his motive for telling Dianne what they knew.
So what have you got Dave?
The bad news first... what I have is that it appears this guy IS a magician... the cell phone traced back to what they call a throw away... a pay as you go type... and it looks like the purchaser's information is bogus... the address went to a location that would be the center of the coliseum parking lot... if there actually were houses still there... my guess is that all the rest of the info including the name is also fictitious... and although we could determine which cell tower the call was being transmitted from, that only limits it to a five or six mile radius of the tower... he could have been just passing by at the time...
In addition to all that, Benny did an analysis on the voice... bad news there too... looks as if the caller was using some kind of synthesizer to disguise his voice...
Benny said that the voice's wave form was electronically produced... something about the peaks being clipped...
I didn't understand it all but suffice to say it looks like a dead end as far as tracing the phone's user or the exact call location at this point.
The good news is that we have our deal in writing from the DA....
You're not gonna believe this but he is offering Vincent Balboa immunity from the murder of Charles Loften and his involvement with the organized crime families in exchange for information he can give us that will bring a conviction of Sophia Grendandino, the supposed current crime family boss... along with her counter parts... and put an end to her bid to reconstitute the crime families and their businesses.
Total immunity?
I know... that's not fair, but we need his information, and it could put an end to all this mess...we do have a trump card to play... seems the DA has been in conference with the FBI and they are willing to provide witness protection and relocation if Vinnie's info leads to the conviction of major figures they are interested in.
I'm willing to deal with it if you are.
Berry could feel his sense of justice slipping a little... deep down inside he want to see Vinnie punished, but his misgivings about the prison system told him otherwise...
I guess if it puts an end to all this mayhem then I'm for it.
Good, we have a little time... about an hour... before the FBI arrives to take custody... that's what the chief was talking to FBI officials about... he didn't want to give up custody but had to... so he bought us some time to talk to Vinnie first... let's go question the suspect... by the way, I asked Benny set up the recording equipment for our session... he's gonna use a voice analyzer and several special pieces of equipment he has during the session...
I figured we couldn't be too prepared... anything we can get will need to be recorded since we only get one chance... after that he's off with the Feds.
Berry followed Dave down the hall to the small interrogation room... finally they believed that they had their chance to break the case wide open, and they were both eager to hear what Vinnie was going to tell them... ...
This time both Dave and Berry sat opposite Vinnie across the table... no good cop bad cop act for them... no pressure treatment... no special tactics... just a simple question and answer period... and a hope that something Vinnie was going to tell them would give them what they needed.
Dave slid a folder across the table to Vinnie.
Here's what you wanted Vinnie.
The DA has agreed not to change you in your involvement...
IF you can tell us things that we need to know to press charges...so it really depends on you Vinnie... and how far you are willing to go to give us what we need to prosecute those responsible.
Vinnie opened the folder and held his hand up as if to say no more talking until he had scanned through the contents.
After he had been reading several of the pages for a few minutes, he looked up at them... ya know, I've been thinking about this, and I'm not sure if I want to say anything after all...
I'd like to go on living if you know what I mean...
I'm not saying I know anything... but if I did, then I would probably be worried about what could happen to me if I talked to the cops... there could be some people with a lot of connections that wouldn't be happy... the kind that can get to you and make sure you never say anything again... if you get my drift.
Berry spoke up.
Look Vinnie, we already know there are some very powerful people involved in this, and we want to protect you from any retribution they might want to take on you... the fact is we have information that indicates there are people planning to shut you up even now.
The word is they really don't care what you plan to do... you're a threat, and they are going to remove that threat no matter what you say...
Ya ain't gonna scare me into saying anything...
I've been threatened a lot before... and I'm still here ain't I?
Would you like to hear the phone recording we have... bet you'll recognize Sophia Grendandino's voice... it's kind of distinctive you know... she was telling the caller that she would take care of killing you... and removing you as a threat from the situation... even being a long time member of the family, she seemed to have no regrets about having you killed... guess she doesn't trust you Vinnie...
Vinnie looked up from the pages he had been studying.
His face was somber... he was looking off in the distance as if someone was standing behind Dave and Berry.
You could almost hear the cogs turning in his head... for the first time in all his crime laden years he realized that all his time... all his loyalty... all the work he had done form them... it had meant nothing... he was truly on his own.
Berry broke the silence.
If you look at the pages toward the back you will see that along with immunity we are willing to put you into witness protection... along with any members of your immediate family.
Vinnie spoke slowly this time... missing the cockiness and self confidence he usually displayed.
I ain't got no immediate family...
I never got married or had any kids... my family is THE family...
Well it looks as if THE family is getting ready to disown you permanently Vinnie and we can keep them from getting to you... but you need to give us ALL the details of what you know, seen, heard... everything stored away in that head of yours... if you do that we can take down the entire group and the power players with them... it could put this whole thing on an entirely different level... with the people behind this out of the way... you could breathe a lot easier.
Vinnie looked over at Berry and then back Dave... the witness protection thing?
I've heard of a few rats that disappeared that way... but I ain't no rat!
Of course you're not Vinnie... you're just a citizen that wants to see the streets cleaned up for other honest citizens... that's an honorable goal... what you are doing is helping to make this country safe...
I'd say that wasn't being a rat.
Dave's words were calculated to make Vinnie feel better about giving them evidence that would put the people he had worked for most of his life behind bars.
He was hoping Vinnie would recognize the real bind he was in and follow the only real way out of it he had.
I never thought it would come to this... all I've ever known since I was a kid was the family... things have changed... if the old man were still alive things would be different... tell the people recording this to pay close attention...
I ain't going through this twice...
There was no need for questions and answers... it was Vinnie all alone that provided all the details they had been wondering about.
He started with the small stuff and worked his way up to the details on what he knew about a plot for the family to control organized gambling on amateur sports... after about a half hour he finally reach the point where he mentioned the real "boss".
There's this guy that's the real power behind the family and most of Mrs. G's plans...
I never met the guy, but they call him the Magician... he contacts her when he wants her to do something for him... she's usually the person pretty much in control of the family business, but I heard Mrs. G takes directions from him because he's the person giving her the money to revive the family business...
Dave was getting anxious.
Has she ever met with him in person?</pre>
