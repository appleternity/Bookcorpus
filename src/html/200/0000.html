        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <pre>Rows of spare parts in racking filled the entire house size room.
The robot stopped.
It squared itself to the first row of shelving.
Slowly the machine extended to fifteen feet tall.
In one slick movement it slipped two arms under a box the size of a small suitcase and started to shrink quickly back to normal size.
The robot retraced its path, placing the item in the middle of a yellow square on the floor.
It beeped, reversing into the cupboard.
"Fantastic little gem," remarked Florian.
"I wonder if I searched for the fuel rod it will bring one back here?"
questioned Josh.
He set to work, located the item on the computer and pressed 'go' on the screen.
The fetcher robot commenced to repeat its trip.
"Come on, by the time we finish installing the stabilizer unit the robot will have brought a fuel rod," said Clay.
They marched to the right-hand side of the Piper.
Josh pointed to the ladder welded against the side of the engine.
"The location of the stabilizer should be somewhere up on top."
He squatted to give the unit a quick once over.
"The spanner in the box must fit the four bolts around the base."
He shrugged.
"The stainless-steel cylinder seems easy enough to replace."
"Try not to take too long.
I'll be here standing guard waiting for the robot to return," advised Florian.
The two boys climbed the ladder.
Clay carried the box.
They stepped off the ladder, onto the top of the engine.
In the center they spied a black metal box.
Josh pointed.
"It must contain the stabilizer unit."
Clay walked across the metal roof of the engine.
Josh was three steps behind him.
When the two boys disappeared, Florian felt abandoned.
She tried to play down the fear rising up on the inside of her.
For several seconds she drifted off into a daydream.
They set up house and were walking along a narrow path to a short water fall where they could shower and take a swim in the shallow lagoon.
The sound of the waves breaking on the beach made her stop to smell the fresh salty air.
A noise from a closing hatch and the robot's return brought Florian away from her paradise thoughts she was daydreaming about.
She grinned at the little fetcher robot then she froze in fear.
Her peripheral vision had spied movement off to her right.
She slowly turned to face the movement.
A second tiger snake was slithering directly towards her.
Florian wanted to call out, but fear stifled her words.
She spied the fetcher robot travelling towards her at full tilt.
It crossed into the path of the snake.
The reptile lashed out to strike.
The robot casually placed the box onto the head of the snake.
Its tail moved violently back and forth several times.
While Florian watched, the tail went limp and stopped moving.
The robot made his way back to the cupboard and disappeared behind the closing door, leaving Florian alone to stare at the snake's tail.
Clay pulled the cover off the black box.
He snatched up the spanner ready to start undoing the four bolts which held the stabilizer unit in place.
They came out easily.
Josh disconnected the three wires, pulling the unit out.
Clay placed the new unit into the black box and tightened the nuts.
Josh connected the wires, packed the old unit in the plastic box and fired up the computer pad on the new item.
Four lights flashed yellow then green.
"We did it," yelled Josh excited at their victory.
Both boys didn't waste any more time.
They sprinted over the rooftop and back down the ladder.
They found Florian standing motionless staring at the tail of the snake.
When Clay's feet touched the metal floor he ran over to give her a bear hug.
"What happened?"
Florian closed her eyes, pushing her head against his chest.
"I let my guard down.
I allowed my mind to wander.
I didn't know the snake was in striking distance.
The fetcher robot dropped the box on the snake's head."
Florian started sobbing.
"It's okay," he said smoothly, wiping the tears from her face.
Josh pieced the explanation together.
"The robot must double as a protector for the crew onboard the ship.
Provided it's fetching something they're on guard duty."
"I've heard rumors they used to make those sorts of robots.
They became too unreliable," reported Clay.
"Fortunately, our little friend in the cupboard is the exception," said Josh.
"I'll second the idea," whispered Florian.
Clay readied himself to lift one end of the large metal box the fetcher robot brought back.
Florian backed away looking more than confident to shoot the hand-laser at the snake.
Clay slowly lifted the end of the box.
Josh pulled the dead snake away, throwing it against the hull.
"What a heavy box," groaned Clay, dropping it back on deck.
"It should be," said Josh.
"If the fuel rod is full it should weigh one hundred and fifty pounds."
"You're joking?"
queried Florian.
"I wish," Josh groaned.
Clay opened the box to examine the contents.
Josh and Florian looked in.
"The glass casing on both tubes looks to be intact," said Josh.
He ran his fingers along the three-foot-long glass cylinders packed in a heavy foam casing.
"They're both dry.
It's good, they aren't leaking."
"One glass tube is empty while the other looks to be full of wet sand," commented Florian.
"It's not sand," Clay corrected.
"If the glass is broken the radioactive material inside will pollute the air.
We'd be dead in five minutes."
Josh pointed to the blackened ends.
"The tubes from the engine connect to each end of both tubes so it can suck out the material.
The anti matter in the tube which looks empty, mixes with, what you said, 'the wet sand' triggering a chain reaction inside the engine which in turn pushes the ship forward."
"Thanks for the scientific analyses," Florian giggled.
"You asked," said Josh.
"If the box is so heavy, how are we going to get the fuel rods back to the shuttle?"
questioned Clay looking doubtful.
Florian quickly thought up an idea.
"Save the trouble.
I vote we leave the shuttle behind?"
Josh shook his head.
"We can't afford to.
We might need the equipment."
"He does have a point," said Clay.
"It'll be a massive task to get the fuel rods up the tree," said Florian.
"Trust me it'll be worth it," said Josh.
Clay lifted his end of the box.
"I'm ready, let's get started."
Josh heaved his end off the ground.
He needed to use all his strength just to hold it up and walk backwards at the same time.
Florian ran ahead ready to shoot the laser at anything that moved.
Halfway along the corridor Josh and Clay switched ends.
By the time they entered the bridge room, Josh was forced to put his end down and step away from the box.
"I'm done," he croaked.
Florian took hold of the handle.
With Clay at the other end, she started to shuffle.
Again, at the halfway point to the outside her and Clay swapped ends.
At the threshold to the hatch to the outside they placed the long metal box down so they could rest.
"I'm exhausted," said Florian.
"We all are.
If we're ambushed now we won't have the strength to run," admitted Clay.
"I didn't think the task would be this hard," Josh moaned.
"Do you think it's still a good idea taking the shuttle?"
grumbled Clay, looking at Josh.
"I do, I just didn't know I'd be this exhausted."
"At least the trip back here will be easy," stated Florian looking at the positive side.
The boys stared at her through slits.
"We'll be flying the shuttle back."
Clay and Josh managed to drag their tired body to a standing position and take hold of a handle each.
"Onward," whispered Josh.
Between the three of them which included swapping ends every sixty seconds, the trip back seemed quick.
Josh tied one end of the parachute around both handles of the box while Clay slowly climbed the parachute material to the first branch.
Florian came next, followed by Josh.
"Okay," said Clay after they'd rested for five minutes.
"I'll pull the box up.
When the box is sitting on the branch I need both of you to keep it balanced.
I'll climb higher and haul the box to the next branch.
We can repeat the sequence at each level."
"Whatever you do make sure the box doesn't fall out of the tree," warned Josh.
"There will be a massive explosion."
With much effort, Clay hauled the box up to the first branch.
Josh secured it while Clay climbed to the next branch.
Ten minutes of hauling saw the plan working perfectly.
Only the short distance to the shuttle remained.
Clay called a rest stop.
"We can't stop now," said Josh.
"We only have a few feet to go."
"I'm exhausted."
"We can rest after the box is in the shuttle," suggested Florian.
Clay gripped the handle at his end.
Josh gripped the handle at the other end.
Slowly they inched their way towards the shuttle door.
Florian watched nervously from the shuttle's airlock.
Three feet from the hatch Clay placed his back foot too close to the edge of the branch, rolling his ankle.
He tried desperately to stay upright.
The box tipped.
Florian lunged to his side.
Just as he fell sideways, Florian took hold of his shirt, throwing him straight at the shuttle.
She placed her foot under the front edge of the box in an attempt to keep it balanced.
Josh steadied his end by squatting, securing the box.
Clay flew through the air.
Losing height, he tried not to panic.
He reached out and groped for the bottom rung of the ladder which leads to the roof of the shuttle.
He used every ounce of strength he could conjure up to hang on.
Hearing Florian groan, he started to swing like a monkey.
Clay's muscles screamed for mercy as he started to climb.
His feet finally touched the bottom rung.
Using the strong foothold, he was finally able to take a moment to rest.
Only then did he see why Florian was moaning.
She saved their lives by placing her foot under the front edge of the box.
Clay closed his eyes, praying no bones were broken.
Josh yelled to Clay.
"Help Florian to get back to the shuttle, I've steadied the box my end."
Clay could tell Florian was trying desperately to be brave.
By the time he reached her, tears were rolling down her cheeks.
Hanging onto the branch above, he yanked the handle of the box upwards.
Florian pulled her foot out.
Clay grabbed her around the waist.
Together they hobbled into the shuttle.
Clay wanted to stay to console her.
The fuel rods must have priority.
He marched back and grabbed the handle of the box his end.
The boys shuffled into the shuttle via the hatch, placed the metal box on the floor and stepped over to Florian.
Clay looked into her eyes.
"I'm so sorry you were hurt," he said gently.
"It's not your fault.
We should have rested like you recommended.
I thought if we left the box on the branch, it might fall."
"You did a brave thing.
How does your foot feel?"
asked Josh.
"It feels extra warm."
"I recommend you leave your boot on," said Clay.
"On my seventh birthday a horse stood on my foot.
I wanted to take my shoe off.</pre>

                    <pre>He was nice to admire, but he was being a pain in the ass.
He led me into his room.
I hesitated when I saw there was only one bed.
I was suddenly nervous.
"There's only one bed."
"Yes.
You're sleeping with me, so I can make sure we don't have to go for another run down the highway."
His obvious amusement at the shock on my face annoyed me.
I'm not sleeping with you!"
I squeaked.
He laughed.
"Yes, you are.
You should just cooperate.
Nothing you have done so far has gotten you out of anything."
I scowled at him, and then crossed my arms in defiance.
He unbuttoned his pants and went to slide them down.
My eyes widened and I turned away from him.
"Why are you taking you pants off?"
I asked horrified.
"Because I sleep naked," he whispered.
He was closer to me than I thought.
My skin tingled at the sound of his voice.
I didn't turn around to look.
I walked quickly to the bed and sat down refusing to look at him.
I'd never seen a guy naked, and I wasn't about to look at him naked.
I kicked my shoes off and lay down.
I felt him climb on the bed next to me and my heart started to race.
I knew he wasn't going to do anything, but the fact that he was naked next to me was enough to make me crazy.
He made himself comfortable next to me.
"I can tell you haven't been in a pack because nudity is normal where I'm from.
You're going to get quite a shock."
I stayed silent.
I wasn't sure if I could speak properly.
He was next to me naked and I couldn't get the thought out of my head.
He slung his arm over me and I stiffened.
"Is that necessary?"
My mouth had gone dry and I could barely form the words.
Thoughts and feelings were raging through me and I couldn't focus.
"I won't bite, and yes because I can hold you down if you try to run," he whispered playfully, as he pressed his body to mine.
I rolled my eyes.
I could already tell it was going to be a very long day.
Chapter 3 I woke up with my face buried in Dominic's chest.
I didn't move immediately because he smelled so good.
I really didn't mind where I was.
He shifted in his sleep and I felt something hard press against my belly.
I stiffened when I realized it was his erection.
I felt my pulse speed up.
I was a little curious.
I kind of wanted to see him naked.
I looked up at him and he looked relaxed like he was still asleep.
I lifted the covers and peeked under them.
His body was perfectly muscled.
He had the perfect v; that ended in a long, thick, hard shaft.
I had the urge to touch him, but I fought the feeling and put the covers back down.
He shifted and opened his eyes.
I was watching him wide eyed, worried I'd been caught.
He looked down at me and his expression was hard to read.
"What are you doing?"
He sounded suspicious.
I smiled weakly.
"Nothing, I just woke up," I lied.
He narrowed his eyes like he didn't believe me, and then shifted so he could look at the clock on the bedside table.
"It's time to get up."
He stood letting the cover fall.
I didn't turn away instead I enjoyed the show.
I was already dressed.
There was no way I was going to sleep naked with him.
He looked over at me as he pulled his shirt on.
"Go to the bathroom and do what you have to, I don't want to stop again if we can prevent it."
I nodded and slid out of bed.
I walked to the bathroom and shut the door.
I flipped the lock then turned toward the sink.
I washed my face and did my best to clean my teeth despite the lack of a tooth brush.
I pinned my hair up, and then looked in the mirror.
I froze when I saw a little window above the toilet.
It was small, but I was thin and flexible enough to get out it.
I glanced at the door as if he could come in any minute.
I still didn't want to go to the pack.
Being in a pack meant rules and I didn't like rules.
I flipped the sink on so the sound of running water would cover the sound of me going out the window.
I stood on the toilet and pushed the window open.
It was a lot harder than expected thanks to the necklace killing my strength.
I wiggled out of the window and landed on the soft grass just below.
I could hear Dominic pounding on the door.
It was now or never.
I ran toward the woods hoping this time I would have an advantage.
I ran so hard and so fast I thought my lungs were going to burst.
The necklace made everything so difficult.
I was weak with it on.
Every time I attempted to take it off, my fingers burned when I touched it.
I collapsed in a clearing near a river.
I was out of breath and the pain in my chest made it impossible for me to go further.
I wasn't used to this feeling.
Werewolves weren't weak like this.
There was a scuffling noise and Dominic stepped out of the trees smiling.
I groaned and flopped down onto the ground and looked up at the sky.
He had made it impossible for me to escape.
"Come on, I want to get on the road."
He hauled me to my feet.
He was acting like I was cute for attempting to escape.
"I want the necklace off," I protested and sat back down.
"No, and you know if you don't cooperate I will throw you over my shoulder," he countered.
I crossed my arms and I glared at him.
"Take it off," I pouted.
"I'm not an idiot, Kylie."
He reached down and caught my wrist.
I squealed in surprise when he threw me over his shoulder and started trudging back toward the car.
I wiggled and struggled, but it was pointless.
He made it to the car, opened the back door and tossed me inside like I was nothing but a rag doll.
"I figure you will get it eventually," my father said dryly.
He was already in the front seat waiting.
I sat up and scowled at him.
"This is bullshit.
Why did you have to bring him?"
He smiled.
"Because I figured if you were anything like me, I would need the help."
Dominic climbed in the driver's seat.
"I have exercised way more than I planned to on this trip."
I crossed my arms as I glared at him.
"Yeah, well it will keep you from getting fat."
He smiled at me through the rearview mirror.
"I could think of better ways to avoid getting fat," he said playfully.
I rolled my eyes and looked out the window.
I had been defeated and it sucked.
There was no way out of it now.
I would be in pack territory before the morning.
It was a little after six in the morning when Dominic drove past a sign that said Welcome to Luna.
Somehow, I knew we had arrived.
He had driven through miles of mountainous terrain and trees before he came to the sign on the outskirts of the town.
In the country didn't even describe what this place was; it was plain hidden.
The area was definitely beautiful.
The mountains were beautiful and covered in huge trees.
It would be a lot of area to run free; that was for sure.
As he drove, there were a few houses here and there.
The main part of the town wasn't large and there were a few stores.
It looked like a tourist destination.
The town was quiet because the sun was coming up.
In a town full of werewolves, daytime was when it was time to sleep.
After he drove through the town, he pulled into the driveway of one of the first houses.
My father and Dominic climbed out of the car.
Dominic opened my door.
I sighed and climbed out.
I followed my father into the house and Dominic followed me.
I stood looking around.
The house was nice, but it was definitely a guy's house.
There was no sign of a woman anywhere.
My father walked toward the kitchen.
"Make yourself comfortable.
Your room is the second door on the right; mine is first door on the left."
Dominic watched me with an amused glint in his eyes.
"There's no point in trying to run.
There's nowhere to go."
"Whatever," I muttered.
I hurried up the stairs away from him.
I went into my room and I was surprised to find it was nice.
It looked like my dad had been preparing for me for a while.
I kind of wondered how long my mom and dad had planned this.
I sighed and flipped the TV on.
I had no clue what I was going to do.
Like Dominic said, there was nowhere to run.
Chapter 4 I woke up to someone knocking on my door.
"What?"
I couldn't keep the annoyance out of my tone.
My father rattled the door handle.
"It's after eight.
Get up and go do something with yourself."
I rolled on my side and looked at the clock.
Sure enough, it was a little after eight at night.
I grumbled as I got out of bed and went to the shower.
Once I was out of the shower, I dressed in jeans and a tank top.
I walked downstairs to the kitchen where my dad was cooking dinner.
I sat at the bar and watched him.
He glanced up at me briefly before going back to what he was doing.
"I'm having a girl named Becky come over in a little while.
She's going to show you around.
It isn't healthy just to stay in the house."
By his tone I could tell he wasn't going to give me a choice.
"Why should I go out?
I have this stupid collar on, and all I am going to do is get my ass kicked."
He smirked like he knew I was right.
"That's part of growing up."
"Whatever, I'm not hungry.
I'm going back to my room."
I climbed off the stool and walked out of the kitchen.
"Becky will be here soon, you better be nice," he called after me.
I just trudged back up the stairs to my room wishing I had the stupid silver necklace off, so I could at least attempt to run.
I lay on the bed watching TV.
There was a light knock on the door.
I knew it was the girl, Becky, so I just ignored it.
After another three soft knocks she finally spoke.
"I know you're in there, and I know you're being difficult.
Your dad won't let me leave until you at least talk to me; so just make this easier on both of us and open the door."
She sounded as annoyed as I felt.
I smiled as I got to my feet.
I walked over to the door and opened it.
Becky was tall and she had long black hair and brown eyes.
She was older than me by a few years.
She actually resembled Dominic.
"Are you related to Dominic?"
"I'm his cousin.</pre>
