        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <h4>Story 1</h4>
                    <pre>A loud scaring knock was made on their door.
They paused as fear rose in them.
"Khadija, it's me Musa" the voice said.
With a sigh of relief, Khadija went and opened the door.
He was relieved to see his friend still in one piece.
"They took my sisters" he cried "I feel so bad not being able to have saved them" he cried Zulu took his wife's hand to calm the fear he noticed.
"We have to leave now" he said.
Passing the back door, they all made their way out.
And carefully they ran into the forests.
"STOP THERE!!"
The voice shouted as he galloped on the horse New fear rose in all of them and they ran faster.
It was pitch black and Sakira could hardly notice anything.
But all she knew was that she was on the right direction.
The horses got closer and closer and with a hard knock on her head she fell to the floor and everything black.
***  Pain throbbed in her head as she tried to gather her vision back.
She noticed she was moving but on what?
Where was her family?
Where is she?
And where was she going?
She asked these entire questions but didn't seem to have an answer to any of it.
She sat up and noticed other girls with her in the cage.
She looked forward and was greeted by the back of a moving horse.
She looked up to see its rider and could automatically tell who it was.
They were distinctively different from them.
The Bornu clans  "Where are we going?"
she whispered to the person beside her But the person seemed to spend more of her time crying.
Sakira was afraid and had no idea of what she was going to face where they were going.
She looked at her hands and noticed shackles on it.
She tried to yank it off but it refused.
Then she noticed the others had the same thing on as well.
Finally, they reached their destination and she noticed they were in the camp of the white men.
What were they doing here?
She asked herself.
The horse came to rest and the rider got down from the horse.
He unlocked the cage and dragged the girls out.
Sakira was afraid and was not ready to face whatsoever was out there.
As the man tried to pull her out, she resisted.
With full force, he pulled her out and she fell face flat to the ground.
"Hey easy there, these are women" one of the white men said "These are no women.
They are nothing but play tools" the rider said.
Sakira grunted as she managed to get on her knees.
Rage filled her and she wanted to do nothing but to kill that rider but unfortunately, she couldn't.
She still wondered where her family was and tried to search but it was useless.
She was pulled up wickedly as she was made to walk with the others.
She still didn't know what was going on but she knew for sure this was not a good thing that was happening.
Then she was shocked when she saw someone.
It was the man she saw yesterday.
How.... what was he doing here?
They were made to line horizontally and shortly Mr. Benson walked slowly to them.
"Yes.
They got me the perfect one" he smiled wickedly.
He lifted his hand and touched her chin but she yanked her face away from him.
"Hmm gutsy" he chuckled.
Then he turned to around and spoke to his men.
"Pack her up.
She's coming with me" he said.
CHAPTER THREE Sakira and a few other girls were made to get into the ship at the Benue River.
She tried to struggle but the men were stronger.
They were packed and locked up in a dark cabin.
Sakira tried not to cry but it didn't work.
Hot tears rolled down her cheek as fear rose in her.
She had no idea of where she would be going.
The ship swayed in motion and they heard noises from the top of ship, the shackles on them made noises as the ship moved.
Sakira remembered her mother's youthful song when her grandma passed on and cried in bitterness and in a louder voice singing; and other captured children started whaling.
Later, an event was taking place on the deck.
The sound of music played and could be heard from the dark cabin.
Silence was the only thing speaking in the cabin.
Suddenly the door to the cabin was opened and the girls jolted in fear.
A huge white man came in. he looked rough and scary.
His boots made intimidating noises as he got closer to them "Well hello there, ladies.
Time to have some fun" he chuckled wickedly He held a girl roughly and picked her up.
Sakira looked at the girl and shivered in fear.
She wondered where the girl would be taken to "No please, I beg you" she cried "There isn't anything like begs" he snarled.
And in the twinkle of an eye, she was taken outside.
The only thing that could be heard of her was screams and cries.
Sakira closed her eyes and wished for all this to just be a nightmare.
But regrettably, it wasn't.
The door opened again and her heartbeat increased.
The man at the door walked majestically into the cabin and stopped in front of Sakira.
Sakira looked up, her body interpreted fear but she tried to be as bold as she could be. Mr. Benson crouched in front of Sakira and grinned.
"What is your name?"
he asked impersonally Silence "I will ask again.
What is your name?"
he asked austerely Silence Suddenly, a weighty strike landed on her face and her lip tore immediately.
"What is your name!?"
he growled.
"Sakira" she said as she shook with rage.
She gave him the coldest look she had.
He held her face roughly "No matter how tough you may act, I'm still your master" he said as he released her face like she was a disease.
Leisurely, he got up and walked out of the cabin.
The next day, Sakira was summoned and was sent to the deck of the ship "She's here sire" the white man bowed and left.
She noticed the way everything was; the ship was a fancy one.
All the white men were here eating and drinking, while her and her kinds were down there hardly having water to drink.
Have this people no hearts?
"Get the drinks from the waiter over there and serve my friends and me, do you understand?"
he said without even second thoughts.
She hesitated.
He glared at her and repeated himself "Do I make myself clear" he asked unemotionally She had to obey peacefully to avoid problems.
"Yes sir" she said and left A tray with three wine glasses and a bottle of champagne, she carried it to where Mr Benson was.
"Here it is sir" she said as she stood in front of the men  "Good.
Drop it" he said to her "Is this her?"
Mr Solomon asked "Yes" Mr Benson smiled "She indeed looks smart" he said.
Gently dropping the tray on the table, she opened the bottle and poured the wine into the glasses.
"Impressive" Mr Solomon mocked.
"I never expected she could have functioning brains" he added  "This one's mine and she's not going anywhere" he laughed.
"What is your name?"
Mr Solomon asked Sakira "Sakira" she said sternly "Hmm, Sakira" he repeated.
"You may leave" Mr Benson dismissed her rudely.
As she returned to where she was previously, she looked up to see someone.
The person looked familiar; the hair colour was the same.
Could it be that guy?
She asked herself.
Noticing a presence, Dave turned around and was very surprised when he saw Sakira.
His big smile returned to his face.
"You, you're here.
How?
What are you doing here?"
He asked with surprise.
"I...I don't know" she said frowned "I was separated from my family.
A man seems to be the reason why I am here" she added "Is the man's name Mr. Benson?"
he asked "I don't know" she said Dave frowned when he heard the statement from her.
He knew it was none other than Mr. Benson that was responsible for her presence here.
She was going to join the others at his place.
He was well known for slave trade and unfortunately, she has become one of them.
"He brought you here" he said and she nodded slightly.
She was not comfortable with him, after all he could be the like them.
Dave was not at ease with this.
He knew Benson was merciless when it comes to slaves and he treats them like animals.
He wished he could do something, but his father would never let him.
His father had presaged him not to ever meddle with the matters of the Bensons except business.
As expected, his father called.
"Dave, I want you here now" His father said.
Sakira turned around to see the man that called Dave and saw it was an older version of him.
"I didn't get to know your name" he said.
"Sakira" she said candidly "Just as beautiful as the name itself" he smiled.
"It was a pleasure meeting you.
I look forward seeing you again" he beamed as he left.
Dave hurried to join his father at the other side of the deck.
"Father, can we buy that girl from Benson" Dave asked "It is obvious Benson won't sell her."
his father said.
Dave was dissatisfied.
He certainly did not want Sakira looking like the other ones at Mr Benson's place.
She was young, bright and innocent.
She doesn't deserve whatever she was going to face at Mr Benson's place.
He perceived a set of people laughing and he turned to see them laughing at Sakira, who was on the floor picking up shattered glasses.
And then, a woman arrived and drew Sakira by her hair.
Insulting and beating her.
Dave couldn't stand the sight anymore.
"Don't go anywhere.
It's none of your business" His father said firmly.
"But father" he argued.
"No buts.
Sit there and don't get up" he said simply.
Sakira left the place and headed to a small dirty cabin.
She sat on the bed and cried.
All her arm was covered with blood.
Glass shards had already penetrated through her skin...
She couldn't stop crying.
She wanted to go back home.
A knock was suddenly made on the door.
"Who is there?"
she asked in fear.
Afraid that someone might have found her in another cabin  "It's Dave" the voice said.
She opened the door as she recognized the voice and he entered with a box that had a red cross on it.
He sat on the bed, opened the box and called her to sit.
"What is this?"
she asked "A first aid kit" he said.
He placed the box to his left and moved closer to her.
Gently lifting her arm, he cleaned the skin with antiseptic and removed all the glass pieces in her skin.
It stung her but she could withstand it.
He cleaned the wound again with alcohol until the blood stopped.
"There, your wound should heal in no time" he said.
She stared at him with shock.
"Why are you nice?"
she asked, "Why are you not like everyone out there?"
she added He smiled.
"That's because I chose to be" he said.
He looked at her and smiled.
He got up, closed the first aid box and was about to leave.
"Rest well" he advised and she nodded.
He left the room  At least light has been added to what's remaining of her.
She returned to the original cabin before any suspicion rose and did sleep well and did not have to feel any pain throughout the night.
CHAPTER FOUR 14 days later.
They finally arrived at Britain.
Sakira was mesmerized by everything she saw.
It was like she was taken to a whole different world.
It was nothing like her village.
There were no trees, no huts; everything here was amazing to her.
She looked at the moving carriages and a lot of busy people.
The girls and she had been put inside the cage and transported to a place.
She still wandered what happened to her family.
As she watched the people of this strange land pass by, they looked at them and made curse words.
At some other parts of the streets, some black people were being whipped and abused brutally and no one seemed to do anything about it.
Is this what she was coming to face?
She thought.
Finally, they arrived at their destination and that was Mr Benson's home.
Sakira observed that there were more black people here.
She was distressed and then comprehended they were not all as good looking and well taken care of like Mr Benson.
She wondered why they were all like that.
They came to a stop but they were still in the cage, she noticed three white persons coming out from the beautiful looking house, they approached Mr Benson and greeted him.</pre>

                    <h4>Story 2</h4>
                    <pre>Ed sniffed his shot, and then threw it back.
"Oooooo!
Yes!
That hits the spot," laughed Ed.
Sam's attention was captured by one of the prostitutes come to offer her services and Ed returned to the table where the Ronite sat.
"Where did Red go?"
asked Ed.
"Who knows?
He just got up and walked away.
Damn telepaths," said the Ronite.
"I've been meaning to ask you something Edward."
"What's that?"
even through the alcohol Ed's senses became alert to something about the way the Ronite asked the question but he tried to keep the suspicion out of his voice.
"Have you met any of the Zoltosians?"
"Aren't any."
"No?
I've been out this way many times.
I've even spent a night or two down there."
"Well, we've been here for an earth month and scanned the entire planet close up.
They got some nice fish and some small birds that are edible, and one big mean sea/land creature that roars loud enough to split your eardrums, but no humanoids."
"What would it be worth to you if I said I had proof?"
the Ronite whispered.
Ed was now very upset.
This Ronite was obviously trying to blackmail him just days before the DAC was scheduled to arrive to certify Zoltos.
"I'm not the one in charge," replied Ed.
"I can take your offer to the man that is."
"You tell him one million Tillidian dollars or the equivalent in pastel stones.
Don't be too long getting back with an answer.
If the DAC arrives before I hear back from you it will be too late."
Sam arrived back at the table to tell the others he was done for the night.
He gathered his chips and followed an ebony beauty to the back rooms.
Red returned and the three of them continued the poker game for another hour.
Ed was simmering over the threat from the Ronite and lost interest in the game.
Red won a couple of hands in a row causing the Ronite to accuse him of cheating.
"Damn telepath!
You're reading my mind.
You would not be winning if not for that!"
The dealer interrupted immediately, "Sir, you know he is not cheating.
We make him wear the thought disc while he is here."
"Well then, show it to me.
I think he took it off during the break."
The dealer motioned for the LD to rise and turn around.
There was a silver disk stuck to the back of his head just at the neckline.
"Does that satisfy you?"
asked the dealer.
At that point a large snort was heard as Paul fell out of the chair he'd been sleeping in.
"I think this game is over anyway," said Ed as he gathered his chips to leave.
"Same time tomorrow?"
he asked the Ronite.
The Ronite looked hard at Ed understanding the inference that Ed would have his answer about the blackmail at that time.
"Yes," he replied and the game came to an end.
Ed picked Paul up from the floor and threw him over his shoulder.
"I don't feel so good, Ed."
"Don't you dare throw up on me."
"Okay.
That was fun, Ed."
"Shut up."
"Okay."
Paul continued to mumble softly as Ed carried him back to the sleeping quarters.
At breakfast the next morning Paul was ravenous.
"You're going to get sick if you don't slow down," Ed warned Paul.
"Sick?
I feel great.
I don't remember much of last night but I feel wonderful.
Can we go back again?"
"Quiet.
Don't talk about it.
You understand?"
"Yes.
So what is the plan for today?"
"We'll talk about it later.
I have to see Gregory first."
Paul's wonderful feeling started to abate as reality set in.
They had left the surface of Zoltos for some reason.
It could be that Gregory wanted to release the green death on Zoltos just to be sure that the DAC scans would be clean.
If that was the case, no humanoid would be safe on the surface for the three days it took to deploy the poison including, presumably, Vadovus, Drovus and their people.
Paul stopped eating and pensively sipped the black coffee.
He had not confirmed that the green death would be effective against furred humanoids and unlike the dose of green death used on the roaring crocodile, the green death was a generic mixture not one made for a specific species.
There was always the slimmest hope that somehow they would survive.
Paul was indeed starting to feel sick to his stomach.
"You were right Ed, I'm not feeling well.
I'm going back to lie down."
"If we do go back again, we'll skip Twilly and go for the dancers," whispered Ed.
"Okay."
Paul stood and slowly left the cafeteria.
He wished he could remember who Twilly was but it didn't seem important anymore.
He had a vague vision of a multicolored blob with a dozen tentacles.
That didn't seem plausible so he just stopped thinking about it.
Sadness was overtaking him and his mind filled with memories of the short time he'd spent with Vadovus and her people.
He remembered warning Drovus about Ed telling her "Blogai" before he surrendered to him in the forest.
Blogai indeed.
Ed watched over Paul but he was a heartless bastard when it came to following Gregory's orders.
He would not hesitate to kill Paul; though Paul liked to think he might feel some tiny amount of regret if it came down to it.
Paul flopped onto his bed and allowed his sorrow to consume him.
Ed needed to tell Gregory about the Ronite's threats but he was refusing to see him until the afternoon.
His morning was scheduled with Glorianna at the onboard arboretum.
By the time Gregory agreed to see Ed it was one in the afternoon.
Ed walked to the first class security passageway and told the guard his name.
The guard turned on the body scanner and, after seeing it was clean, entered a passcode into the touch panel activating the door between the common areas of the ship and first class accommodations which opened allowing Ed to walk through.
"Remember to follow the lighted path.
Failure to do so will result in immediate arrest and possible prosecution," said a recording as Ed passed by.
Gregory was waiting in a conference room in the business section of first class.
Visitors from the common areas were not welcome under any circumstances in the living and recreational sections of first class.
"Edward, welcome."
Gregory sounded annoyed.
"I'm sorry to bother you sir.
There is an immediate security threat we need to discuss."
Ed glanced around the conference room.
It was very high class.
High grade electronics covered one entire wall with images of outer space and some of current news in various galaxies including one feed from the Commonwealth of Planets main governing body at the Dome.
All of the feeds were currently muted.
The furniture in the conference room was so expensive looking Ed was hesitant to sit on any of the chairs so he remained standing.
Gregory was seated and looked very comfortable as an attendant cyborg in the shape of a silver humanoid brought him something to drink.
The cyborg remained at his side ignoring Ed entirely.
"Yes, you told me there was a security threat.
What is it?"
"I was approached by someone about Zoltos.
He said he has information about the animals that inhabit the planet.
He claims to have spent some time on the planet at some point."
Ed was having trouble wording his information so as to keep the knowledge of the Zoltosians out of a conversation that could be heard and possibly recorded by the silver cyborg, yet get Gregory to understand that they weren't the only ones with knowledge of them.
"Which animals is this person concerned about?"
"The bears I told you about."
Gregory's eyes dropped to the table then shifted sideways to where the silver attendant stood.
He looked back at Ed as he picked up his drink and took a long draught from it.
"I remember the bears," he said as he returned the glass to the tabletop.
"You know Edward we can't have anyone saying he has claims to Zoltos.
Why don't you try offering him a little money to forget about Zoltos?
Hmmm?"
"Sure, if that's how you want it, Sir.
What if he refuses?"
"Well, we have clear title.
If he refuses we'll take him to court.
But that could delay our plans so try the money incentive first.
Then explain to him just how much it will cost him when we win.
Such a big loss would no doubt ruin him; it would really mean his life wouldn't it?"
"Yes, Sir.
I'll take care of it."
"Good.
By the way have the drones started their final, ah, scans of Zoltos?"
"Yes, Sir, it will be two more days and we will be able to send our final report to the DAC."
"Perfect, have a pleasant day, Edward."
Ed and Gregory left the conference room headed in opposite directions.
Ed understood the conversation to be an authorization to pay the Ronite a reasonable amount of money to keep him quiet or, if he proved unreasonable, the approval to kill him.
Ed returned to his quarters, a small personal compartment near the general bunks where Paul slept.
He pulled a case out from under the bed, pressed a button activating the retinal scan.
A light flashed as he put his face near enough for the scan to read his eyes, the locks popped open as the scan recognized Ed as the rightful owner of the case.
Among other things in the case, he kept single dose injectors of the green death hidden in a hard cased shell.
It would come in useful in his negotiations with the Ronite, if he didn't cooperate, "poof' he would be no more.
He opened the case and wrinkled his heavy brow when he realized there was only one injector left.
Eventually he'd have to sock away some more but this would do for now.
All of the current stock of green death had already been loaded into the drones for Zoltos.
Ed felt nothing for the Zoltosians, a successful colonization meant his success as well as Gregory and Glorianna's success and he craved success and all the delights that came with it.
Someday he would be in first class, for now he hoped the Ronite would argue over the money he would offer which would be considerably less than the million he wanted.
Ed had taken a dislike to the man and would be delighted to make him disappear.
As it turned out Paul was still feeling depressed so instead of making an evening out of it Ed went alone.
He didn't want anyone to remember seeing them together so he sat in the bar watching for the Ronite to show up.
When the Ronite passed by walking toward the poker tables, Ed stood and finished his drink telling the bartender he'd see her tomorrow and walked out of the bar.
He stood in the dark hallway waiting for the Ronite who, having seen Ed pay for his drinks and leave, had waited just a few minutes then followed him out.
Ed saw the Ronite pause, unsure which direction to take.
From the darkness Ed cleared his throat to get his attention then turned and walked slowly through the darkness toward the engine rooms.
The Ronite followed.
"Where are you going Ed?
You know I can see clearly in this darkness now that my eyes have adjusted."
"I just don't want anyone around to hear our conversation," said Ed.
"The man I work for says one million is too much."
They stopped walking.
"That is too bad because that is what I want.
With what I know your boss won't be allowed to colonize Zoltos.
You told him that didn't you?"
"I told him.
He won't go over one hundred thousand."
Ed was wearing infrared goggles so he could see the Ronite clearly, standing within arm's reach, in the nearly completely dark hallway.
"That is not even a reasonable offer.
I need the million or close to it."
Ed already had the injector in his hand as he shrugged his shoulders and reached for the Ronite.
"What can I say?
He is not a reasonable guy."
Ed's arm settled over the Ronite's shoulders.
The Ronite turned his head to look at Ed and shoved him in the chest with both hands.
As Ed stepped back from being shoved he nicked the Ronite's neck with the injector.
The Ronite slapped his hand to his neck.
"Get away from me you ..."
The insult about to be spoken to Ed was never uttered as the Ronite dissolved inside his clothes.
Ed waited a moment to be sure none of the green death was still active then he used his foot to shove the small pile of clothing into a bag he pulled from his pocket.
An object fell from the clothing; it was a photograph of the Ronite when he was younger holding a baby and smiling, Ed crumpled it up and dropped it into the bag before he walked a little farther down the hallway and opened a panel on the wall.
He dropped the bag into the opening and secured the panel back into place, the clothes would end up in a black hole with the rest of the garbage from the ship, leaving no trace of the Ronite.
Chapter Ten
The Tillidian commander had demanded a meeting with Gregory.
"The DAC will be here in nine hours.
Normally we would have moved our ship away from any planet they were coming to scan long before now.
It is causing some consternation with the Tillidian Planetary Council that you are still on board."
"We will be departing."
"Yes, but when?"
"It should be safe, I mean, in exactly ten, which is five Tillidian hours.
We are loading some supplies onto the GS2 even now."
"How is that going to work?
The GS2 only holds two people."
"Obviously I'll need to leave Miz Waddel, her people, and the scientist on board."
The commander gave Gregory a disgusted look.
"In exactly five hours we will launch Miz Waddel's GS2 with you on it, even if I have to throw you on board and eject the GS2 into space."</pre>
