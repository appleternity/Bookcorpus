        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <pre>Your children would not be favored for good matches nor theirs and so on."
Her mother paused and gave her coy smile.
"He would still have to win the hunt to claim you.
It would be difficult since only the noble families train their children for this ceremony."
Oh, God.
What had her big mouth gotten her into now?
Sam shot a quick glance at Nicole and she nodded.
"Fine.
Yes.
I will comply if you can get Daddy to let me add a choice to the list."
She narrowed her gaze and stared at her mother.
"What about the last question, Mom?"
Renata Demakis shifted her gaze to the floor before meeting Sam's, her discomfort at the question evident.
"A bond between wolves will grow.
You are noble, and with that birthright comes certain obligations.
Your wolf doesn't get to choose."
"That didn't answer my question, mom."
"We are people first, Samantha.
Eventually your wolf will understand her place.
Mine did.
Does that answer your question," she snarled.
Sam drew back in disbelief.
"She did not just say I am less than you."
Her wolf growled in disgust.
It was a mutual feeling.
How could she say that?
Sam stood and stalked toward her mother.
Her wolf's magic clawed to the surface, demanding retribution for the insult.
I'll handle it.
"You can tell Daddy.
I'm going out.
I won't be attending dinner."
"This isn't a choice you can make, Samantha."
Her mom's eyes flashed with concern.
"It has already been made for you.
Fighting will only make problems for everyone."
Sam narrowed her gaze and growled, allowing her vocal cords to change.
The sound her wolf produced would have turned the average person's blood cold.
She brushed past her mother and disappeared into her bedroom.
Sam snatched a long white sweater from her dresser and pulled it on over the camisole she was wearing.
It hung down past her hips, hugging her smooth curves.
She smiled at her reflection in the mirror across the room.
The black leggings showed off her long, muscular legs.
She slipped her feet into some lightweight sandals and grabbed her purse.
Alcohol was needed desperately, as was space from her conniving mother and father.
Her mother's brief indulgence about adding a name to the list had given her hope for a short moment, but it had been dashed to pieces.
"We have to find Chase.
Please look for Chase."
Her wolf nudged gently.
The weight on Sam's shoulders lightened when she remembered the gentle smile of the soldier at the airport.
She walked out into her sitting room.
Nobody had moved, and her mother's heated glare could have cut steel.
Even though her mom was clearly angry, she could see regret in her mom's face, too.
At the moment, it didn't matter.
She needed space.
"Give my apologies to the guests, Mom.
I'm going out.
Don't wait up."
"You are not going anywhere, young lady."
Samantha sidestepped her mom's attempt to grab her purse.
"I'm a grown-ass woman, and you will not keep me in here like a petulant teenager."
She flashed a glance at her sisters.
"Are y'all coming?"
A chorus of yeses sounded through the room and the other three girls followed her out the door.
She overheard Tess whisper to her mother that she would "keep an eye on her."
"Traitor."
Sam shook her head and hushed her wolf.
It doesn't matter.
You know there's no way out of this for me.
I'm not willing to abandon my family.
***
Sam bounded down the rear staircase, through the chef's kitchen, and out the back door.
Her eyes widened when Johnny, one of her dad's drivers, came ambling out of the garage.
She put on her best cheerful face and flashed him a sweet smile.
"Johnny," she called out and walked toward him.
Her sisters followed close behind, their heels clicking on the stone driveway.
"Miss Samantha, it's so good to see you."
His gaze drifted over her shoulders and came to rest on Hallie.
Sam's smile widened.
"I'm going out for a bit.
Which car has plenty of gas?"
His face paled.
"I will take you, Miss Samantha.
You know your father doesn't wish you girls to go anywhere alone."
"Thank you, Johnny," Hallie piped up from behind.
"We need to go now."
Hallie stepped forward and placed her hand on his forearm.
She whispered something into his ear, and he nodded.
Sam watched in amusement.
She wasn't the only Demakis sister rebelling against tradition.
After everything she said about giving those guys a chance...
"She did say she was just playing the field," her wolf whispered.
True.
But, the parents still won't be pleased.
Johnny darted into the garage.
A few moments later the white Tahoe pulled out and stopped in front of them.
He slid out and opened the back door to help them in. Sam walked around to the other side and climbed into the front passenger seat.
He closed the door behind her sisters before sliding behind the wheel.
"How long have you had feelings for my sister?"
Her voice was a whisper, but he froze and slowly met her gaze.
His nervousness filled the air with a sickly sweet tension.
"Not here," he mumbled, breaking the moment.
They pulled out of the neighborhood and onto a main street.
"Head to the Mirage," she directed.
He nodded and turned the vehicle to the right.
"Sam?"
"Yeah, Tess."
"You know this disappearing act will only make Mom and Dad angrier."
"I know, but I'm not in the mood to have three blind dates at once during dinner."
Hallie and Nicole giggled.
Sam smiled and looked back at Tess.
Her lips were drawn tight, and she was shaking her head.
"We can drop you back at the house, Tess, if you would like to have the dates instead.
Maybe Daddy will let me off the hook if you want one of them."
"It's tradition, Sam.
I couldn't take one of them even if I wanted to," Tess snapped.
Sam scrunched her eyebrows together in confusion.
Then it dawned on her.
Holy hell!
"You like one of them, don't you?"
Sam smirked when Tess gave her an appalled look.
"Not true," Tess argued.
"Okay, whatever you say," she added and turned back around in her seat.
If Tess liked one of the contenders for her hunt, it was doomed.
Men participating in her hunt would not be allowed to participate in one of her sister's hunts.
If they survived it at all.
The Tahoe pulled to a stop in front of the Mirage, and Sam slid out before Johnny could get around to open her door.
CHAPTER 3
She marched in the doors and straight to the VIP bar.
A pretty brunette woman in a skintight white dress greeted her at the door and pulled it open for her.
"Good evening, Sam."
"Evening, Maggie."
Sam had grown up with Maggie.
They graduated high school together.
She wouldn't say they were best friends, but they had hung out some.
Maggie had always loved the lights and energy of the casino and was a pursuing an online business degree while working at the Mirage.
Sam wanted to get as far away from all the lights and glamour as she could and had chosen to go to college on the east coast.
"Will your sisters be joining you?"
She asked, inclining her head to the three girls finally trailing through the casino entrance.
"Yep, I just really need a drink."
Maggie laughed.
The soft sound relaxed Sam.
"The booth in the corner that you like is open."
"Thanks."
Sam gave Maggie a quick squeeze before walking into her favorite lounge.
The VIP Mirage bar was her quiet place in a sea of noise.
Her family's status got her in, and Maggie kept the unwanted male attention out.
***
"Why are we going to the Mirage?
Her family owns The Glass House."
"Shut up, man.
I've got inside sources.
She hangs out at the Mirage when she's in town.
Come on."
His brother slipped the keys into the valet's hand, and Chase reluctantly climbed out of the truck.
The dinner at his parents' had been great, but his wolf was antsy and wanted to find Samantha.
His wolf was never anxious.
It was making him uncomfortable and irritable.
"And your source would be?"
"The VIP bar hostess."
"Good grief, Chris."
He flashed his brother an accusatory glance.
"Are you stalking the Demakis girls?"
"Just one of them.
Samantha's sister Nicole frequents the Mirage as well.
The two younger sisters, the twins, are usually at The Glass House."
Chase's eyes widened with interest.
"Why are you stalking her sister?"
Chris glanced at him with a twinkle in his eye.
"Why are you looking for Samantha?"
"Fair enough."
Chase sighed and followed Chris through the sparkling glass doors.
A barely dressed woman with shoulder-length black hair, greeted them with a red clipboard in her hands.
"How can I help you, boys?"
Chase snorted.
He was easily twice her age, though she would never be able to tell by looking at him.
Adult werewolves weren't ageless, but it took centuries to develop any wrinkles at all.
Chris backhanded his shoulder, and he grabbed at the offending hand, missing by a hair.
"I'm looking for Margaret," Chris piped up.
"She's working."
The hostess gave him an evaluative once-over.
Apparently Chris passed her test.
For some unknown reason she smiled, stepped aside, and waved them toward a tall brunette in a curve-hugging white dress.
Spiked red stilettos and red coral jewelry made for an unforgettable statement.
Chase couldn't shake the thought that he recognized her from somewhere.
"So what's the plan if they are here, Chris?
I just walk up and say hi?"
"Chase, they are here.
I spoke to Maggie on the phone."
Chris waved at the sexy brunette.
She held up a hand, indicating she needed a minute.
"Who is Maggie?
I think I recognize her."
"Don't you remember Maggie and Maggie?"
"No way," Chase exclaimed.
The familiarity finally made sense.
She was their baby sister's best friend from high school.
"She ratted on a client for you?"
Chris smiled sheepishly.
"Our Maggie asked her to do you a favor."</pre>

                    <h4>Story 2</h4>
                    <pre>Brenda is the secretary of the Student Senate, a job she has held for more than twenty years - and you could tell.
Every wrinkle, each gray hair had a story to tell of misdeeds, silliness, and corruption among the students that came and went through that office.
They confided in her - for as many secrets as she let slip through her lips, there were many more that she kept hidden.
Her longevity and the willingness of student leaders to tell their secrets to her made what she knew indispensable to the task at hand.
It also didn't hurt that she arrived before just about anyone else to the third floor and thus Mike could escape too much attention by making his visit then.
It took her a second, but she saw right through his disguise.
"What can I do for you, Mike?"
"Actually, Brenda, I'm here for a favor."
"Okay," she said with a laugh that revealed her toothy grin.
"You're not going to like it."
"So?
What else is new?"
"I need to find out who holds a grudge against me."
"You think I can help you identify this stalker of yours?
It's entirely possible, although you are crazy if you think my memory will be the only thing you need to search."
"Why is that?"
She took a deep breath.
"The answers you seek will be found there," she pointed toward the offices of the infamous leadership honorary that dictates, behind closed doors, much of what goes on in Student Government.
"How can you be certain?"
Mike asked earnestly.
"You can't just dig into your novel for the source of that threat that has emerged.
You have to dig into this University's past, for all its shady dealings, corrupt practices, and worthwhile endeavors.
Once you truly understand your history here you will understand what the present has in store for you."
He shook his head.
"I was afraid you were going to say something cryptic."
Chapter Fourteen
THE POLITICIANS-IN-TRAINING FELT compelled to blur the lines of friendship and politics.
If you were a personal friend, you were expected to be politically loyal to one another.
And it worked the other way.
If you were adversaries, you could not be friends.
This caused a lot of heartache as elections neared, when scores of politicos were forced to choose sides that strained friendships and - in a few minor cases, ended intimate relationships.
Ben always liked to think he was an exception to the rule.
Yet, that was not to be.
In his final campaign, a friend of his was running for student body president with the Campus Party; another, closer friend was joining the Gator Party ticket on the number two spot.
Ben was torn.
Eventually, he joined the Gator team, but that was not the end of it.
Many of his younger friends were on the Campus side, and he had more fun chatting with them.
Yet, because of the moles on both sides, he was accused of spying.
And even when he sat near the Campus party presidential candidate during an ethics hearing, and engaged in conversation with him, Ben was given a true grilling by the other side.
He did not need that kind of grief.
These were all his friends, to one degree or another, and he saw their hypersensitive loyalty test as an unneeded element of campaigning, but a true sign of where his friendships stood.
That incident crystallized everything for him, and reminded him of why he will soon give it all up...
AS MIKE ADAMS remembered him, Kyle Schiff knew how to handle people.
For that reason, he loved his job as a hospital administrator.
It gave him real power to help deliver life-preserving care to those who needed it most; he was making a real difference in people's lives.
It was a feeling he had not enjoyed even as an advocate in the battle to defeat AIDS, and only truly felt once before, as a teacher shortly after graduate school in Florida.
When he got the message from Mike that he wanted to meet, he was unsure of how to react.
While in college, they had a unique and contradictory working relationship.
Kyle was the charismatic leader; Michael was his behind-the-scenes policy wonk.
As Mike tried asserting himself as a student leader, Kyle was reluctant in his support, but also reluctant to explain why.
Yet, they remained good friends throughout, and, as many would attest to, their way of working together functioned better than most partnerships.
Kyle didn't care for Mike's new book simply because the character clearly but loosely based on him put too much emphasis on his flamboyant personality and willingness to act abrasively with authority figures.
That did not stop him from agreeing to talk with this former college friend all the same.
"Hey, Mike," Kyle said, greeting him in a hectic public entrance to the hospital in Orlando.
"Let me show you around, and make our way to my office to chat."
"Alright," Mike said softly.
At least very few people will recognize me here in Orlando, he thought.
They began walking through the lobby area that doubled as a spacious arboretum, and tried their best to ignore the very loud rustlings of hospital patients and guests.
An occasional doctor or resident acknowledged Kyle as they walked by.
An assistant stopped him long enough to grab a signature before scurrying away.
They turned a corner, and there was Kyle's office, appropriately marked in the center with his name and job title.
"Okay, Mike, what's going on?"
Kyle said in an uncharacteristic desire to get to the point quickly.
He wanted this confrontation with his past over with.
"Well, no doubt you've seen the news."
"Yeah, you and Adam are hitting it off," he said with a roll of his eyes.
"It's just for the movie," Mike said defensively, knowing full well the history Kyle and Adam shared in college, and Kyle's disappointment that marked their graduations.
"But it's more than that."
"Of course.
You're on somebody's hit list."
"Right.
Brenda thinks-" Kyle perked up and changed his attitude at hearing about the old professional secretary.
"You spoke to Brenda?"
"What else could I do?
It's clear whoever wants to do me harm has a connection with what was said in the book.
And Brenda thinks it has something to do with that leadership honorary you and I never really liked."
"Are you suggesting a network of current and former student leaders in Florida are being used to undermine a film that makes light of their activities?
Come on, Mike, even those people aren't self-absorbed enough to do something like that."
"They did that sort of thing while in college.
How different would it be to blackmail someone in "real-life," especially when they know where to strike?
But the question I had was whether you knew anything about this?"
With a sigh, Kyle crossed his legs, and said, "Please, Mike.
You of all people should know I have a problem with confrontations.
It's just unneeded stress, and I can't deal with it very well.
Besides, I like what I am doing now.
I have no reason to see any of that change."
"I can see that."
"Mike, your real problem is not going to be finding out whether this leadership honorary has the time, resources, and motive to engage in these attacks.
It's pretty clear they do.
What you have to worry about is what they will try to do to you if you get too close."
"You can't be serious."
"You better hope I'm not.
Remember, they chased fraudulent drivers, spied on their own members, and did everything in their power to shut down the extracurricular careers of those who opposed them.
If - and this is a big if - they are willing to engage in activities outside of college, there may be no limits to what they will try to do."
Mike shook his head, disbelieving in what Kyle was saying.
Kyle may not still trust me, but he seems certain that Brenda's instincts are correct.
This can't be good.
Mike did not know what to make of it, but it was unusual that Kyle trusted Brenda's point of view that readily.
BENNITA JONES DID not know George Avelli very well.
His rise to prominence in Student Government occurred almost concurrently with Bennita's decision to disappear into her work at Shands to finish her doctorate.
Their political lives were thus on very different planes of existence, which is fitting, because their goals were very different.
She sought power to implement her ideals; he sought power to gain notoriety and self-importance.
Her few memories of him suggested a very strange little guy.
An Italian-American, his catholic upbringing made him very interested in union politics, but also made him conservative on social issues like abortion.
His trademark look included very short (but not quite crew-cut) hair, and over-sized Henley shirts.
He was at one point a strong proponent of the politicians-in-training that composed the leadership honorary, but left when they failed to deliver on several promises.
He earned Mike's trust very quickly, and within months joined Mike in his short-lived New Democracy Party effort.
They remained political allies for a while, until Mike abandoned campus politics all together to make a move to Georgetown University.
They rarely kept in touch since.
Bennita was meeting with him, although he did not know it, because he showed up on Mike's list.
Like Kyle, Mike had exaggerated a character's personality flaws that mimicked George's own issues.
They were meeting at the gift shop within their alma mater's Museum of Natural History.
Based on what she remembered, George was easy to spot amidst the crowd that was filing out of the lecture hall of the museum.
She waved her hand in the air, and energetically tried getting his attention.
She did.
"George, right?"
she said over the voices of those around them.
"Yep.
It's been a long time, Bennita."
"Well, we've all been busy since college."
"I suppose."
"Then what have you been up to?"
"I've got a job with the School of Natural Environment, here.
I help conduct computer tests involving everything from communication equipment to sophisticated pH testers.
Anything we can do to study jungle life, basically," he said with a detached indifference.
"Well, that doesn't sound too far from what I do.
I still work with hospitals and their radiological equipment.
Anything we can do to study radiation, and the like," "Right."
"Anyways," Bennita said as she gestured a suggestion of moving away from the increasingly packed gift shop.
As they walked, Bennita continued.
"I do have a reason to talk other than just this reunion we're having."
"It's not about Mike's situation," he said hesitantly, with a noticeable pang of sadness in his voice.
George wore his feelings on his sleeve, and that made upsetting situations hard to deal with for him.
"I'm afraid it is."
"Is he in any danger?
Why isn't the FBI helping to protect him?"
"Mike thinks he is in so much danger that he had eluded the FBI in an effort to lead an independent investigation into this mess.
What I wanted to know is if you knew anyone who would want to do this to him?"
"Oh gosh, I don't know.
If we're talking strictly people from college, I really can't think of any.
Sure, he made plenty of enemies with those in the leadership honorary, but he also gained their respect.
And his book is such a parody of life on campus that I really can't see how anyone would take it so seriously.
I mean, even people like me have lives built around something completely different than politics, and we could care less if he gets rich off it.
I'm just a little mad that he didn't consult any of us on it," he said flatly.
Bennita nodded as she began stepping down a flight of stairs with George.
He seemed to dismiss the whole notion of this incident a little too easily.
He practically shrugged off its importance, despite the threats involved.
She could not help but wonder why that was.
It left a nagging feeling in the pit of her stomach.
ADAM RUPPESBERGER REMEMBERED having a strong sense of respect for David Snyder, even though at the time he shared a popular skepticism about David's involvement in campus politics.
Many saw David as an ambitious Jewish kid whose rise to power came not from taking over an existing organization (such as the Jewish student union) or some policy expertise, but creating a whole new organization from scratch with dubious intentions.
That's not to disrespect his philanthropic endeavors; David now professionally runs a national charity called Buddies Forever that promotes volunteerism in pediatric and geriatric hospitals.
It's just that some saw his efforts to promote the group as also a way to promote himself.
Of course, David would simply answer his critics by pointing out that people believed in what he was doing and joined him in accomplishing those goals.
Very few are lucky to build an organization from the ground up and then use its popularity for general good use.
When Adam asked to meet with him, David at first suspected that Adam was changing his mind and wanted to help the organization with a sizeable influx of good Hollywood money.
That is why, when Adam arrived at BF's national headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he was disappointed by the more modest $250 donation.
"Now that we have the re-introductions over with, what is on your mind, Adam?
Surely you are not here to discuss your current project with Mike."
Adam shifted in his chair as he looked across David's desk.
"Actually, I am."
"Why is that?
Wait, let me guess.
You guys are trying to play detectives and solve a whodunit mystery before the bad guy does more harm," he said, exuding confidence before running a hand over his wide, toothy grin.
"Exactly.
If you could find fault with Mike's book, what would it be?"
"You mean, aside from the fact that one of his characters was a well-known volunteer that became successful in campus politics, much like I did?"
"Was that a problem for you?"
"You certainly picked the wrong place to start your investigation.
Sure, it was not a flattering parody, but I've heard worse over the last 15 years.
So what if I ended up joining that leadership honorary after he left?
I also never pursued a lot of things you guys thought I would.
I have no idea who would take time out of their life to play pranks on him, but I am too busy running this organization to do anything like that.
As a matter of fact, I only skimmed his book, and I am not sure, frankly, whether I'll watch the movie.
I just don't have the time," David insisted.
Adam made a mental note of the subtle anger David Snyder expressed over the parody of himself, and his attempt to dismiss this investigation.
Even with all his doubts about David's alibi and professed lack of a motive, he just could not see the professional philanthropist as a would-be killer.
To counter that theory, Adam thought, Maybe he had someone working with him as an accomplice.
MIKE WAS IN his car, fresh off his conversation with Kyle, trying to apply his costume once again.
I can see how this is could get old very quickly, he thought as he struggled to put his black curls back on.
The sound from his phone indicated he had not one, but two incoming calls.
He checked the clock and said out loud, "Right on time," just before he pressed the button that brought up both callers as a conference call.
"Alright, it's unsafe to keep this going long," Mike pointed out to his two allies, Adam and Bennita, who were both in vehicles fresh off their interviews.
"So, we all know the rendezvous point.
And I trust we all will have plenty to confer about when we get there."
"Indeed," Adam said in agreement.
"Let's just hope it is all worth it, Mike," Bennita cautioned.
Mike did not hesitate to state what seemed to be the obvious.
"If not, then we are in a lot of trouble."
Chapter Fifteen
IN THE COURSE of political events at the University, some incidents that gather press attention confirm the worst in the politicians-in-training that dominated Student Government.
Both sides of the campaign to save the Academic Council's budgeting authority engaged in hyperbole and silly stunts to highlight the flaws in electing the other side.
Despite the high volume of negativism, it actually turned out to be the most genuinely competitive election in a long time with the highest turnout of actual votes cast in almost a decade.
The reason for the unusual outcome was an incident that occurred on the third floor one fairly routine day.
Ben, Eric, and Wayne were conducting official business for the Academic Council when they noticed an unusual piece of mail.
Inside a manila envelope, someone left one black rose and a copy of what looked like a Student Senate bill.
"My God, look at this!"
Wayne exclaimed, as Ben and Eric struggled to get a glimpse of what the bill proposed to do.
It proposed eliminating the Academic Council.
Scribbled in the margins with red letters was the phrase "Continue campaigning and this will be passed."</pre>
