        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

"And what is your idea of causing some commotion?"
asked Chelsa.
"I was getting to that.
If we can broadcast the testing done on Accidents in search of more DNA alterations for Perfects on the public news-screens, then that should stir up some commotion on the streets.
At the same time, we can start the Individualism Case by trying to convince the population that non-genetically altered people aren't much different from Perfects.
Two birds, one stone."
That doesn't sound like a very reliable plan, thought Kristi.
But a plan is better than no plan.
chapter forty-seven 
[ Troop ]
Nick passed an electro-slate to Troop and said, "Start editing the video you want Jane and I to broadcast on the public news-screens.
All of the footage shot from the contact-cams is saved onto the file labeled 'Lab Film'.
I'm going to start stashing some of the Revealers-only-technology in the safe."
He unfolded his lanky frame from the couch.
"You coming with me, Jane?"
Jane followed her husband out of the living room and Troop opened up the Lab Film folder and began to filter through the recording.
Most of the shots wouldn't be useful for his purpose.
Eventually, he found some footage he deemed suitable for making a video clip to stir up some trouble.
"Do you want some help with the film?"
Chelsa asked.
"If not, I think I'll help Jane and Nick hide their equipment."
"Go ahead and help them," he said.
"Is the clip done?"
Finn asked.
"Almost."
Troop rewound the video.
"Let me play it one more time to make sure it's good to air."
"I don't think you'll have time to do that."
Finn drew the curtains over the window he was looking out.
"The Searchers are at this apartment complex.
I just saw a group of them enter the building.
We have to air the film now."
"Okay.
We should have some time before the Searchers arrive since we're on the thirty-seventh floor."
"All the same, there's no more time to edit the film," Chelsa said.
"Are Nick and Jane still busy?"
Troop asked.
"Nope."
Nick strode into the room.
"Just finished putting away the last of the equipment."
"Here's your slate.
I saved the film clip under the name InTheLab."
"How long does the clip run?"
"A bit over ten minutes.
I hope that's not too long."
"No, not at all."
Nick accepted the electro-slate containing the precious video.
"I'll get started with the override.
Keep an eye on the public news-screen.
When your video starts playing, start to make your way to the safe place.
Oh wait, I haven't given you directions to the safe place, have I?"
Troop shook his head.
"Alright, you remember Solomon's Sandwich, right?"
"Yeah."
"A few blocks away from the sandwich shop is a city park.
In the park there is a Meditation Garden."
Kristi cut him off.
"Oh, I know the place you're talking about."
"Beneath one of the benches is a trapdoor that leads to an underground shelter," Nick said.
"Stay in there until a Revealer member comes and gets you.
I'll send for someone to fetch you guys if Jane or I can't do it ourselves."
Jane coughed gently, interrupting Nick.
"I think we better hurry with the news-screen override.
The Searchers have reached the fifteenth floor already."
The couple disappeared from the living room, retreating back into the electro-room.
Finn resumed his position by the window while Chelsa and Kristi conversed quietly.
Troop fingered the straps of his backpack.
He had packed lightly, taking nothing more than a few granola bars, water bottles and an electro-slate; he shouldn't need anything else if all went according to the plan.
Some time passed, and he wondered if Nick and Jane were actually capable of overriding the system.
What if they overestimated their skills?
Troop thought.
Knock!
Knock!
Everyone swiveled their head to the door.
"This is the Homeland Security conducting an official door-to-door search.
Open up," barked a sharp voice.
"It's not us," Kristi said.
"Not yet."
Some of the tension deflated from the room.
There was the sound of a door being thrown open a few units down.
Finn pried the window open, preparing an escape route.
Knock!
Knock!
The rapping noise sounded louder.
Troop guessed the Searchers were two units away from the Filches' quarters.
Nick or Jane, please hurry up and get the film playing on the new-screens.
"Open up!
This is Homeland Security conducting a door-to-door search."
The voice sounded even closer.
Troop slung on his backpack, ready to flee at any second.
He paused mid-action, though, when he saw Finn drop his crutches out the window.
"What are you doing?"
There was no way Finn had just accidently lost his crutches in one go.
"Storing my crutches where I can retrieve them later.
You didn't think I was going to carry my crutches and descend the apartment at the same time, did you?
I was planning on getting out of here via the fire escape unless you have a better idea."
Troop poked his head out the window, spotting the crutches piled together in some hydrangea bushes; one of them appeared to be crooked, though Troop wasn't positive, since he was thirty-seven stories above the ground; he had to squint to see the crutches far below him.
"I hope your crutches are covered by insurance," Troop said.
Finn made a "whatever" face.
Knock!
Knock!
All occupants in the living room froze.
There was no mistaking it.
The Searchers were here.
"Out.
Everybody out the windows now," Troop said, his voice terse.
"Homeland Security conducting a door-to-door search.
Open up!"
bellowed a masculine voice on the other side of the door.
Nick and Jane came thundering into the room.
"Okay," Jane said.
"Hold on a second."
She turned to Troop, Kristi, Chelsa and Finn and said in a quiet voice, "The override is taking longer than we thought.
We'll keep on trying, but in the meantime, get out of here."
"Open up!"
a Searcher commanded.
"We will break in forcefully if you do not cooperate."
"Coming."
Jane motioned for the group to hurry up and leave.
Chelsa clambered out the window, followed by Finn with some difficulties.
Ghost mewed plaintively, watching his owner leave without him.
Jane stroked the top of his head, comforting the leopard.
Troop indicated for Kristi to go out the window before him.
"If you do not open up in ten seconds, we will shoot down the door!"
This was followed by some pounding to emphasize the point.
Troop hastened and climbed over the windowsill; the door was bashed down a split second later.
He ducked down, pressing his body against the wall and finding some footing on the fire escape.
He looked up and saw Nick drawing the blinds over the window.
"You guys managing alright?"
Troop asked.
"More or less," Kristi replied.
"My bad leg is throwing me off balance," Finn said.
His knuckles were a chalky white from squeezing the railings.
Troop held his breath, watching Finn perilously climb down the fire escape with his paralyzed leg hanging limply.
Kristi shortly joined Finn on the platform on the thirty-sixth floor.
"It's working," Kristi said.
"Troop, you're film is playing on the public news-screens."
Troop took a glance at the nearest news-screen.
He didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
Debbie the reporter was reporting some type of new product being recalled.
He was about to tell Kristi this when the news-screen began to blink on and off.
Then Debbie was replaced by the video Troop had created earlier.
He descended a few more rungs of the rusty fire escape and observed the citizens milling the streets of Klisbury.
A few were watching the news-screens and scratching their heads in confusion, but most still hadn't noticed the hijacked screens yet.
Troop counted how far he'd descended.
Twenty floors left before we're home free, he thought.
Provided no one on the streets spots us making an escape.
When he cast another look to the news-screen, Debbie's face was back on.
"Sorry for the minor broadcasting incident that occurred just a few seconds ago," Debbie said.
"Everything is under--" Her words were chopped off when Troop's film began to play again on the screen.
Troop felt his sneakers slip on the edge of a platform and he barely saved himself from free falling fifteen stories.
His fingers scrabbled against the window ledge nearest to him.
"This is the truth," a voice boomed out from the public speakers lining the streets below him.
With a start, Troop realized it was his voice being projected from the speakers.
Somehow, Nick and Jane must've manipulated the speakers into playing above the standard set volume in addition to overriding the public news-screens.
Nine floors left.
So far so good; no one has noticed us yet.
Troop resisted the temptation to watch his film being played.
From the sounds coming from the streets, it seemed that the citizens had finally notice something was amiss with the news-screens.
Five floors to go.
I think we're actually going to pull this off.
chapter forty-eight 
[ Kristi ]
Kristi was worried.
She knew Finn was tiring, even though he worked hard not to show it.
"Three more levels to go," she muttered to herself, thankful they were low enough on the fire escape to be blocked by the trees planted along the edge of the apartment complex.
"Three more left, three more left, three more left," she chanted under her breath.
"Two more levels left, two more left."
"Success."
Finn pushed off the rim of the platform and awkwardly landed on the ground.
He braced his fall with his hands and knees then pushed himself onto his feet.
"You guys coming?"
Chelsa silently dropped down beside Finn; somehow, Finn had surpassed Chelsa while making his descent.
Kristi shimmied her way down until she was only eight feet above the ground before leaping off the fire escape.
Troop was beside her in an instant.
Finn hobbled over to his crutches and let out a grunt.
"Guess I'll have to make do with only one for now."
He shoved a crutch beneath his arms then tossed the other back behind the bushes; it was little more than a piece of mangled metal after its thirty-seven-story plunge.
"I'll lead," Troop said.
"I know how to get to the Meditation Garden, too," Kristi said.
"I don't mind taking the lead."
Troop raised his eyebrows.
"Allowing you to lead us to the Wayland Hotel was the last time I trust you with directions."
"Point taken."
Troop went out of his way to make sure they took all the backstreets and dodged behind a building every time a law enforcer came into view.
Although, to be honest, Kristi thought they could've walked down Main Street in plain sight all the way to the Meditation Garden and no one would've noticed.
All eyes were trained on the public news-screens, which were still exhibiting Troop's film.
A few more turns and backtracks later, they were at the Meditation Garden.
There were a few soccer matches being held in the city park, but the Meditation Garden itself was void of citizens.
Visiting the garden in daylight, Kristi realized it wasn't as big as she had imagined it to be.
At most, the garden took up an acre of space.
A small dirt path spiraled its ways through the bamboo plants and trees until it reached the center of the garden.
A small pond with shimmering droid-koi splashing in the water dominated the heart of the garden.
Moss covered stone benches surrounded the pond.
"Did Nick say which bench the trapdoor is beneath?"
Chelsa asked.
"No," replied Troop.
"Start searching, everyone."
Kristi dropped to her knees and peered beneath the bench besides her.</pre>

He looks at the serving girl in a lascivious manner before roughly grabbing her and tearing off her top revealing her gorgeously shaped breasts.
He devours them.
She gives in to the lust.
He removes the rest of her clothing and his own.
He lays her on the ground, spreading her legs and quickly entering her.
Damon continues to pour the wine whispering lustful words into the ears of his guests adding to the sexual tension in the air.
The barbarian and the serving girl make mad passionate and uninhibited love in front of everyone.
Genevieve continues to dance and strut around the couple.
It isn't long before the orgy begins in earnest.
Prompted by the other serving men and woman and the remaining barbarians, the guests soon begin to embrace and fondle one another, removing their clothing and giving themselves over to the situation, fully and completely.
Many of those present haven't experienced such a thing and yet they embrace this decadence or swinging scene depending on your point of view.
A mass sexual euphoria grips the bodies and minds of those present.
Like some demented guru Damon grins happily at the writhing nakedness before him.
He watches buttocks rise and fall, breasts fondled and lustful hands grasping and clawing at glistening, sweating flesh in the firelight.
The music continues to play but amongst it are the many moans and pitches of passion and climaxes as all those gathered abandon morality and decency.
He is joined by Genevieve.
They kiss lovingly.
They enjoy a glass of wine together.
They hold hands and watch.
Hours later, Damon stands in an expensive silk kimono in the security office of the vineyard.
A clock on the wall indicates that it is just after 3 AM.
He is standing in front of a bank of CTV monitors watching.
Unknown to the party guests there is extensive surveillance equipment operating throughout the estate, providing potential blackmail material, should further coercion be required.
At the moment his attention is focused on Max Crawford's cabin.
The studio executive is sprawled naked and spent on his bed, lying alongside of him, also nude, is one of the young serving woman from the orgy.
Both are exhausted and depleted but pleased from their love making.
Damon is also contented, although the young girl looks like she is nineteen or twenty, she is in fact fifteen, and he has the footage and sound of everything that just took place in that room.
He may never need to use this material.
In fact Crawford may never come to know it exists unless it is required.
Damon has many such footage, audio and pictures of all manner of people doing indecent things over the last few years.
His parties are designed for this.
He gathers the incriminating evidence and stashes it away until it is required.
Amongst his many other talents he is a master blackmailer.
He even has damming evidence on just about every leading member of the Illuminati families.
It has never been used - except a couple of times - and then only to bring them into line.
But he has the goods on some of the most powerful and influential people in the world.
His father of course approves of what he does: "The way to victory is to know all there is about your enemy," Zane would always remind him.
"Excuse me sir."
Damon turns and looks at Mr. Stiles.
"A most successful party wouldn't you say?"
"Indeed it is," Mr. Stiles agrees, "another triumph."
"Yes, but we must try a different theme next time.
Although a Roman orgy always reels them in." Damon then notices the manila envelope in Mr. Stiles' hands.
"Is that for me?"
"Yes sir."
Stiles obediently hands over the envelope.
"That's what I have so far on the people investigating your uncle.
You'll see there are perhaps one or two things we may be able to use."
"It's not much, is it," Damon says as he casts an eager eye over the material.
"I'll keep on it but most seem straight lace."
"Look deeper," he orders.
"Yes Mr. Ravenscroft."
"I don't want to have to arrange something unless absolutely needed."
"I concur."
"And the other matter?"
"Nothing concrete, but there is something definitely in the wind.
I haven't much except a name that has popped up a couple of times."
"What name?"
Damon enquires.
"Grozny."
CHAPTER 17
The Ravenscroft Children
Bobby
Avalon, the Hamptons, 1997
Bobby Henry Ravenscroft, nine years old, splashes water at his father.
They are in the pool house.
Zane picks up his son and playfully tosses him away.
Bobby resurfaces blowing water from his nose, which is never a good sensation.
"Huh!"
Zane yells and swims away as Bobby gives chase.
Bobby is a healthy young boy, bright and athletic with jet black hair and dark brown eyes and is the youngest of the three Ravenscroft children.
"Got you," he yells as he grabs the old man.
"Damn your fast," Zane says in praise.
"And you're slow."
"Get out of it," Zane replies once more grabbing his giggling son and tossing him away.
Bobby loves it, trying to make as big a splash as possible in the process.
Bobby quickly comes back up for more but sees his father swimming away.
"Come on," he calls out.
"Practise your breaststroke - I need to catch my breath," Zane tells him, genuinely out of breath.
I'm not as young as I use to be.
Zane reaches the edge of the pool and gets out, sitting himself down on the edge with his feet dangling in the water.
He watches his son as he starts swimming the length of the pool.
Bobby slices through the water with ease.
Zane has a sudden flashback of himself at Bobby's age swimming up and down in this very same pool.
Memories.
Zane shakes them off - he doesn't want to live in the past.
What's gone is gone.
There's only now and the future.
Zane turns his attention to Bobby.
He watches his youngest with a father's pride.
He has never tried to play favourites with his children but there is something about Bobby that he admires.
The Ravenscroft children will all have important roles to play in the years ahead but Bobby will have the most significant.
Zane sees Bobby as a world leader.
There has always been the notion that along with a one world government there should also be a leader of this one world government, a king if you will.
He sees Bobby as this monarch.
Now as to whether this can be truly obtained, Zane has his doubts, but as they keep trying to shape the world towards this concept they will need a public figure to shepherd it along and as far as Zane is concerned Bobby fits the picture.
He has all the makings within him to achieve this.
He just needs the right guidance - the right education - if he has this then the rest will fall into place as he already has the charisma, the personality, the competiveness, and the intelligence.
He is top of his classes and all his teachers have high praise for him.
He is even showing quite a lot of musical talent with the violin of all things.
One more arrow to add to his growing quiver.
And yet.
There is another side to Bobby which shows itself every so often - a temper.
He is sometimes quick to anger.
Too quick for Zane's liking.
He thought it might be ADHD or something.
But the quacks found nothing.
Still, it's something he will have to keep an eye on and that's one thing he will do is to keep two eyes on Bobby.
"Don't bend your arms so much," he calls out as Bobby swims pass.
Bobby loves the water.
He loves the feeling of weightlessness it gives him.
He usually spends too much time in the pool shrivelling up like a prune.
But he loves it.
And he loves his father.
He worships him.
And so he doesn't bend his arms so much after hearing what his father tells him.
He would do anything to please him.
His relationship with his father is closer than to his mother, who is distant sometimes, more so as he gets older.
He is also close to his brother and sister, especially Samantha who is always looking out for him.
Always eager to please and be appreciated, Bobby sometimes goes out of his way to do this.
Although it takes more effort he has found that the results are nearly always better.
Bobby knows he is destined for greatness.
He has a sense of it.
He knows that his father also sees it in him.
Their conversations of late have been about the great work - 'The Work of Ages'.
Zane has begun to tell him of just who their family is and what they have been striving towards: "Knowledge is power only when it's turned on, son," he would tell him.
"You must understand the past to move ahead, to learn from the mistakes our family have made.
Errors in judgement, in ways of thinking, not being able to adapt quick enough when required and that it doesn't matter how much power you obtain for it will either burn you out or light you up.
It all depends on how you handle it.
Many a promising young man has been ruined by getting his hands on too much power before he was able to handle it.
I had such power given to me at a young age and I wish I had more time to prepare for it, but it doesn't always work out that way."
"That's why I want you to be prepared for it at no matter what age it may come to you.
And it will come to you.
One day, if you so desire, you can become the most powerful person in the world - a god amongst mortals.
But we must be smart in achieving what we want" Bobby understands.
He's a good boy.
He always listens intently when his father speaks.
Taking in every word he tells him, determined to learn and not let his father down.
This is something he promises himself as he swims faster and faster towards his future.
The White House, Washington D.C., Present Day
At a diplomatic function at the White House, Bobby Ravenscroft, now 27, is seizing the opportunity to promote Ravenscroft interests.
He is talking with great elegance to world dignitaries about the goal of establishing a select group of people to control the global economy.
With all the financial unrest the world over in the last few years a truly world governing body overseeing the financial stability of the planet is the safest bet moving forward into an uncertain future.
He is peppered with many questions from those listening: "How would such a body operate?"
- "What balances and checks would there be?"
- "Who would be in charge?"
- "How much power would it have?"
Booby has an answer for each question.
"It could operate under the UN with an oversight committee to oversee the checks and balances to make sure that there is no favouritism or blatant manipulation.
As to who would be in charge, well there would have to be a chair person, someone with impeccable credentials, an individual who could report to the UN and governments of the world and as to how much power this body would have; well, it would have as much power as it's given."
"What you say has merit and has gained some momentum in recent time," one of the foreign dignitaries points out.
Bobby continues his dogma.
"It's an inevitable Force Majeure I assure you.
Just look at the state of the world, everywhere we see chaos, war, poverty, injustice, hunger, just look at the so called haves and have nots in my own country, the divide between the rich and poor is an ever growing chasm that in the end will lead to civil unrest, like we've seen in Europe over the austerity measures."
"And why is that?
Yes, the austerity measures were harsh and unjust in my opinion, but they were brought about by poor economic management by the governments involved.
When you break it all down the cause of such instability is easy to put your finger on.
When a man or a woman has no job and can't even put food on the table for their children, when everything has been stripped away from them, their savings, their home, their dignity; what else is left but to take up arms, it's the final act of a desperate person.
But prosperity, money, jobs; it's the answer and has always been so.
Gandhi once said: 'The way to happiness is to keep the belly fed and the ambition in check': and there is such simple truth in those words."
"Admirable words Mr. Ravenscroft," another dignitary begins to say.
"Please, call me Bobby."
"Bobby...the problems of the world are not so easily fixed."
"That's putting it mildly," another adds.
"You'll get no argument from me on that point.
What I'm saying is not going to be easy, it's going to take a monumental effort, a complete shift in the way we think about economics, a new paradigm must be provided, a new work for the age.
Just ask yourselves this, what do we want out of life?
What do we really and truly want out of life?
Happiness, we all enjoy our nip of scotch before bedtime and all we really want is to be happy, is for our children and grandchildren to grow up healthy and live happy lives."
This brings nods of approval from all gathered.
"Life may not have meant to be easy - but it should be fun," Bobby tells them.
"Economic prosperity is the key, one body governing and setting the economic policies of the world, in the end, is the only viable answer."
"The economic systems of the world are broken and need to be fixed.
If we don't bring about such change then I foresee a bleak future ahead of us, one filled with ever growing unrest and greater wars.
God help us if we have another world economic crisis, for if we do I'm not entirely sure that we would survive it."
Bobby Ravenscroft has the highest public profile of all of Zane's children, tall, dark and gorgeous; he is the cover boy of Washington and darling of the socialites.
His public image of a rich and eligible bachelor only adds to his aura.
As head of 'One', a philanthropic organisation dedicated to helping better the lives of the people of the world, as well as subtly pushing the doctrine of a 'one world' everything, has given Bobby a saviour like image that has allowed him to push along the globalist agenda.
"You really do live up to your nickname, don't you," a charming female voice says.
Bobby turns around and is confronted by the lovely socialite and famed cello player, Rachelle Cipriano; shoulder length blonde hair, blue eyes, at 32 years of age she strikes an elegant and desirable figure in her slinky white evening dress that hugs the contours and curves of her shapely figure in all the right places.
Bobby likes what he sees.
"Oh, and which nickname is that exactly?"
"Bobby Dazzler," she tells him vivaciously.
"I've always liked that one.
I suppose I do come across a bit bright at times, but when you believe passionately in something as I do you can't help but get carried away."
"No need to sell me, Bobby, I've already signed up."
"You know I saw you play once in Vienna," he says.
"That was a long time ago."
"Not so long.
Are you performing now?"
"I'm actually here for the season with the Gradinsky Chamber Orchestra."
"Then I'll defiantly come and see you."
"I would hope so."
"I heard you gave up playing for a few years."
"Publically yes, but I still put out a couple of albums," she assures him.
"A pity, such a beautiful talent as yours should always be on display," he tells her warmly, with an arresting smile.
"You like classical music, then?"
"Oh yes," he tells her with enthusiasm, "classical music has stood the test of time and will continue to do so for ages yet to come.
I've always had a great love for Mozart and Beethoven.</pre>
