        <h1>Guessing the Story from a Frame Representation</h1>

        <div id="instruction">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            The <strong>frame representation</strong> is designed to illustrate the high-level concept of a story block.
            A frame representation will usually contains important <strong>verbs</strong> and <strong>nouns</strong> in the story.
            <br/><br/>
            Below, we will present a frame representation table. Each row has the following components:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Frame</span>: The name of the Frame.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Weight</span>: A weighting bar under the Frame. A higher value means that the frame is more important. The shades also changes according to the importance. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 900;">Lexical Unit</span>: Lexical units that belongs to the Frame.</li>
            </ul>
            In the following task, you will need to <span class="highlight">carefully read the frame representation</span>.
            Four stories will be presented, please select the one that is <span class="highlight">closest to the frame representation</span>.
        </div>

                    <h4>Story 1</h4>
                    <pre>"Ask the two old men that were in the diner while I was in there.
Ask Fred."
No one said anything for a while.
Then the old man said, "We did.
They said there was no one else.
Only you."
"That's not true.
There was another man."
They'd quit listening to me now.
"By a show of hands, who of you says this man is guilty?"
the old man asked.
After a pause, presumably to count hands, he asked, "Who of you believe he is innocent?"
"I am innocent," I said, mostly to myself.
It appeared that I was the only one listening to me now.
"You are whatever we say you are, son.
Evidence speaks louder than words here."
I hated the old man.
I wished I could switch places with him.
I'd show him what it felt like to be innocent, but believed guilty with no way to prove yourself innocent, because you were dealing with stubborn idiots.
"You've been found guilty of the murder of Chloe."
After a long pause, the old man leaned down to me and said, "You're gonna die, son."
Chapter 6 Just when I thought my stomach couldn't knot any tighter, it did.
I had to make myself breathe.
I also had to choke back the vomit.
The smell of rot was stronger now, and I was getting the feeling that there would be no way out of this.
Period.
Not all the talking in the world could save me now.
"In keeping with the traditional values of our little community, no crime shall go unpunished.
In this case, the crime is murder.
Cold, calculated murder.
Take it off."
The ugly cop removed the blindfold from my eyes.
I squinted in the desert sun.
When my focus cleared, I noticed that the crowd was comprised of approximately seventy-five people.
Farther back, behind the crowd, I saw my Explorer, along with dozens of other vehicles.
Some dating back to the twenties and thirties, and ranging all the way up in years to my new Explorer.
Rust had taken over the older vehicles, and I could tell for sure that they'd all been sitting out here for a long time.
My heart began to pound.
Every horror movie that I'd ever seen flashed before me.
I hoped that what I was thinking was wrong.
I looked back to the crowd.
They were mostly older people who all looked at me with disdain.
I looked at the faces of each of those people, and what I saw scared the hell out of me.
They all wanted me to die.
I looked down in defeat.
That's when I noticed it.
It took a minute for me to recognize the device before which I was knelt.
Everyone was waiting for me to see it.
I sure did see it.
It was a guillotine.
"What is this?"
I asked.
No one answered me.
The old man, the ugly man, and the crowd just stared at me.
There were two other large men a few feet from me, one on either side.
They also stared.
"This can't be legal.
I had no trial."
I shook my head, but I couldn't shake it away.
"This isn't legal.
This isn't right.
I want to talk to an attorney."
Everyone roared with laughter.
The old officer stepped closer to me.
He squatted down beside me.
"Son, things work a little differently here.
There are no attorneys, no judges.
We, as a whole, decide your fate based on the actions you take.
We don't waste time and money on judges and trials.
The evidence speaks for itself."
I stared him straight in the eyes, and pleaded with him again.
I somehow knew this would be my last chance.
"Sir, I'm telling you that I am innocent.
I did not kill Chloe.
I am guilty of peeping in her windows, and I'm sorry for that, but I would never harm her.
I'd never harm anyone.
You must believe me.
What would you do in my situation, if you were me?"
The old man thought about it, and then shook his head slowly.
"I'd never be in your situation, son.
I'm not a murderer."
He stood up and turned away from me.
To the crowd, he said, "Let's begin."
I had no choice.
If I was going to die, I was going to die trying.
I knew that I wouldn't get far, but I was going to get as far as I could.
I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
I jumped up quickly.
The ugly officer was between the steps and me so I had to jump off the platform.
As soon as I started going, I heard yelling and shouting, but I wasn't hearing what they were saying.
I had to get away.
With my hands still handcuffed behind me, it wasn't easy to run, or land after jumping from a platform.
True to physics, I fell and rolled in the dirt, claiming a mouthful for my own.
As I landed, I heard two shots fired.
It took me a few seconds to realize what they were.
It took me a few seconds longer than that to realize that I was hit.
The crowd didn't gasp in horror or shock.
All they did was step back a step or two to keep from getting my blood on them.
As soon as I realized that I'd taken a shot to the knee in my right leg, and one to the calf of my left leg, the officers and the other two large men were surrounding me.
They all looked down at me and laughed, the crowd laughing with them.
I heard applause.
The officers commended each other on their marksmanship.
I wanted to grab my injuries out of instinct.
However, due to the cuffs, I was unable to do that.
I did manage to roll around pathetically, screaming and moaning in agony.
My kneecap had shattered, I knew.
I couldn't move that leg.
The other bullet hadn't found the bone I didn't think, but it still hurt like hell.
I'd never felt pain such as this.
I looked down to try to assess the damage.
I saw my jeans ripped to shreds around the knee.
They were nearly black with blood, which was gushing forth from my shattered knee.
By the amount of damage, I figured a shotgun to be the culprit.
The other leg was bleeding, but not nearly as much.
The hole was much smaller.
I could see my blood mixing with the dirt beneath me, making a sick sort of blood-dirt batter.
It was thick and dark.
My stomach turned.
I shivered.
I blinked rapidly to fight off the impending blackness, but I failed.
When I opened my eyes, I didn't know where I was or what was happening, but soon enough, it all came back to me.
The unbearable pain and the mouthful of dirt.
I heard people talking around me, but was still unable to make out words.
Everything sounded so far away.
Gradually, it came clear to me.
"He's awake," someone said.
I heard the old man walk over to me and say, "I was wondering if you were ever going to come around.
I wouldn't do this to an unconscious man."
He chuckled, stood up, and walked away.
I looked around.
I was face-down on the guillotine.
I got up and ran away.
Far, far away, and I never once looked back.
At least in my mind, I did.
My body didn't move a muscle.
No matter how loud my brain screamed at it, it just laid there, unmoving.
My mind was screaming at my body so loudly, it seemed deafening to me.
Nevertheless, it wouldn't budge.
It was in shock.
I didn't know how long I'd been out or how much blood I'd lost.
I tried to speak, but my mouth was too dry, and my tongue seemed far too thick.
I worked up what little spit I could, which was gritty from the dirt, swallowed, and tried again.
"No."
That was it.
That was all I could manage.
My body was failing me.
I was suddenly very angry with myself.
Was this how it was going to end for me?
Was I going to let it end this way?
Did I have a choice?
"You should've thought about that before you went and killed an innocent girl."
I couldn't keep track of who was speaking any more.
I couldn't turn to face them.
I couldn't raise my head more than an inch or two.
I'd lost all strength that I had.
It seemed that the only thing that was working was my mind.
I was trapped in my own useless body.
I thought back.
I knew that I was thinking my last thoughts.
My body might fail me, but damn it, my mind was still working relatively well, and if this was it, I was going to enjoy the last few minutes I had.
I was angry with myself for not fighting harder to live, but then I thought that maybe my mind, on some level, didn't want my body to fight.
Maybe it wanted to die, to see my Rose.
Knowing that I would see her again comforted me.
I was still mad at being wronged, but the thought of reuniting with my sweet Rose was more than enough compensation.
I'd waited long enough.
Life without her had been miserable.
I thought back to my last meal.
Chloe had served it to me in the diner.
If I'd known it would be the last thing I'd ever eat, I would've enjoyed it more.
Maybe I would've ordered something else.
I would've smoked more cigarettes.
I would've had more than one piece of cake.
I would've had a few beers afterward.
Maybe many beers.
I wanted to cry.
I thought it was funny that even though I had come to terms with the fact that I was getting ready to die, I still didn't want to.
Even without Rose, I wanted to live.
Why people hold on to this world when there's nothing left to live for was a mystery.
Maybe it was because we never knew what was going to happen next.
Maybe it was knowing that even when things were bleakest, when times were hardest, there was still positive to be seen.
There was always an 'it could be worse' to be found.
Life was just full of surprises.
You never knew what to expect.
I wanted to live.
"No."
I managed one more protest.
No one heard me, though.
If they did, no one acknowledged it.
I decided to enjoy the last thoughts I had.
Marrying my sweet Rose.
She'd been the most beautiful bride.
As she walked toward me down the aisle, I'd thought that we would grow old together.
We were going to spend the rest of our lives together.
We were going to raise kids together.
Nothing else was ever going to matter.
We had each other, and that was more than enough.
I had no idea that Rose would, in fact, spend the rest of her life with me, but I would have to spend the rest of mine without her.
Then there were the kids that we were denied.
My body may have failed me, but my eyes still formed tears.
They fell off my face and straight down to the platform beneath me.</pre>

                    <pre>"Ok, one two three!"
As Galaxy said this each unicorn simultaneously lay their horns on Hextia and orbed her out of the attic.
"Will they be ok?"
"Well there is six of them sharing the orb, so I'm sure they'll be fine, maybe just a little fatigued."
"Where are they taking her?"
Katie asked alarmed.
"Just outside, everyone needs to gather to discuss Hextia's fate.
Katie could I possibly ask you one more favour?"
"Of course."
"Please help Belle down the stairs she's still too young and can't fly.
I would do it but I'm afraid I'm a bit too large to fit down that narrow staircase."
"So that's how Hextia caught her, she couldn't fly away."
Katie asked sadly.
"Yes both her and Sherari were helpless, Sherari could run away, but she stayed with Belle tried vainly to protect her, but they are both free now, and hopefully with time they will recover from this terrible ordeal."
"Why was Sherari looking after Belle?
Where's her mother?"
Rex took a moment to reply, there was a deep sadness in his large dark eyes.
"Now is not the time."
He said sharply.
Katie silently scolded herself for speaking before she thought things through, it was obvious the reason both Belle and Rex were so upset was that Belle's mother must have been killed, possibly by Hextia.
"Just take her down."
Rex said shortly, he then spoke to Belle.
"Belle, I need you to go with Katie."
"I don't want to."
She refused.
"Please dear, she is on our side, no harm will come to you I promise.
"Rex I'm so sorry."
Katie began to apologise.
"It's fine."
He said and walked over to the window, opened his wings and descended down.
Katie turned too Belle.
"I'm so sorry about your mum, I know it doesn't help much but I'm an orphan too, I lost both my mum and my dad and my grandpa."
Belle nodded sadly, they stood there for several seconds before they went back down the stairs to join the others.
Chapter 12
A very different scene greeted Belle and Katie as they exited Hextia's house.
The dull, deep sand, which had once surrounded the house, had now made way for thick green grass while new leaves and little white flowers adorned the old fig tree.
At the same time Katie was astounded at the sight of some 60 pegasi and unicorns surrounding the fig tree.
A buzz filled the air as Belle and Katie passed through, heading over to Galaxy, who had made a giant flat rock underneath the fig tree, to serve as a podium.
No sooner than Galaxy had mounted the podium did the congregation cease their talking and nickering.
Complete silence prevailed, not even a bird's chirp could be heard.
"Alright everyone, we have to think clearly about this situation, where will we send that foul creature?"
Galaxy asked?
"What about our secret hide away?"
Sadi suggested.
Immediately a rapture of noise broke out as everyone began arguing amongst themselves.
"Quiet!"
Rex's deep voice bellowed over the racket.
He had been, quite literally, hovering over the proceedings now, he then landed silently next to Galaxy.
"That won't do Sadi, what if Hextia comes back and possess danger to us again, where will we go then?
No we must keep it a secret."
Galaxy finished.
"My queen, what about sending her to our cousins by the sea, perhaps they can help us find a prison for her?"
Pursang suggested.
Galaxy thought on this for a moment.
Her mother, Sea dancer, a beautiful light caramel mare was their queen and she would help at the drop of a hat.
But Galaxy didn't want to endanger her mother's herd as well, as far as she knew Hextia didn't know of their existence.
"Not a bad thought Pursang, but this is our battle, no need to endanger the lives of our friends as well.
No we have to deal with this by ourselves."
"We need to send her someplace where she can think about what she had done, some inescapable place, far from us."
All the unicorns and pegasi begun bickering once again.
"I have an idea."
Katie said.
Everyone fell quiet and watched Katie.
"What is it Kate?"
Galaxy asked?
"There is a place, in my world, I do believe it will be perfect for Hextia!"
Katie said excitedly.
"Go on."
"Prison.
It's the place we send our criminals, it has guards, and high fences, and hardly anyone ever escapes.
She'll go on trial and hopefully get locked up for a long time, if not that they might think she's mad and put her in a mental institution, where it's just as bad, they are also locked up and get given tablets to keep them calm.
Trust me either place is horrible with bad food, and bad people, she will have all the time in the world to reflect on her cruelty."
Galaxy and Rex looked at each other and nodded in agreement.
"Does everyone agree with Kate?"
Most of the unicorns and pegasi reared and neighed in agreement.
Galaxy then called Katie to join her on the rock, as soon as Katie stood beside her she continued speaking.
"Kate, I, my unicorns, Rex and his pegasi would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping with this awful situation, you have shown great bravery and kindness, and if there is anything we could do to repay you, please let us know."
"You make it sound so grand, but it wasn't all me if it hadn't been for Pluto I wouldn't have even been here, and who knows what might have happened."
"Still, you left your world to help save ours, and for that we are truly grateful."
With this Galaxy stepped forward and gently hugged Katie.
Hextia on the other hand was still encircled by sharp horns.
She had an ugly sneer upon her face.
Prison, please there's nothing those stupid, powerless humans can do to me.
I'll escape, and then I will get every last one of these creatures!
"Kate could you please help us tie Hextia up."
Galaxy asked as she leapt off the platform.
Galaxy then lowered her head to the ground as long thin vines grew from her horn.
Katie picked them up and walked over to Hextia.
As soon as Katie approached Hextia, the witch began to scream and fight, resisting the vines.
"Would you prefer it if I knocked you out first?"
Said Pursang over he's shoulder as he walked by.
"Argg!"
Hextia growled, as she slowly turned to allow Katie to tie her hands.
As a precautionary measure Katie also used the vines to tie hobbles around Hextia' s feet, to prohibit her from running away as well as vines around Hextia' s waist, to secure her tied hands.
"Alright everyone, I think it's safe to have some dinner."
Rex called out.
Some of the unicorns responded by placing their horns on the ground and made their favourite fruit trees appear.
Katie watched astonished as large, peach, apple, pear and even mulberry trees grew rapidly from the ground each bearing large, ripe fruit.
Pegasi hovered to pick the higher fruit, whilst unicorns reached up to pick the lower hanging fruit.
She then climbed up into a large tree and helped herself to big red apple.
She too was ravenous, although not quite accustomed to a strictly fruit diet.
Once she had her full she observed everyone around her.
All around the freed unicorns grabbed hungrily at food.
Katie found it difficult not staring at their emaciated bodies.
Don't worry.
She assured herself.
Soon all will be over, and they can return to their lives.
Directly beneath Katie stood Sherari, a pure white mare  reaching up to eat some of the large red apples, whilst Belle stood next to her suckling happily, her little fluffy tail swishing from side to side.
Rex stood patiently next to Hextia guarding her.
Katie watched him for a while before she decided that he must be hungry too.
Quickly she picked two apples, then carefully jumped down from the tree and walked over to him.
With her hand outstretched towards him she offered the fruit.
"I thought you might be hungry?"
His large wings were tucked tightly against his body, with he's muzzle he reached forward and gently picked up the berries with his soft lips.
"Thank you.
I'm sorry for snapping at you back at Hextia's house, you off all people know of loss."
"That I do."
Katie replied sadly.
"Both my parent disappeared when I was little, and now my granddad has died as well, it's not easy but I try to be grateful for any small thing, like this, this has been the most amazing experience, helping you, Galaxy and everyone else.
It really opens your mind, makes you see a bigger picture.
Bad things happen but you got to keep your chin up, and who knows maybe someday something really amazing happens."
Rex smiled at her.
Then his eyes frowned with sorrow.
"Rainy, Belle's mother was a sweet, caring mare, she was so excited for Belle's birth, but there were complications, the unicorns tried in vain to save her, but she was too weak.
Your right though Katie, I might have lost my mare that night but she gave me a beautiful little foal, and now because of you I have not lost her as well, safe and sound."
They stood looking at each other for a few more minutes each lost within their own thoughts
"Thank you Katie."
Katie reached around his neck and hugged him tightly.
"You're not bad hey, for a human" Rex joked and nickered softly.
"And you're amazing."
Katie said letting go of his neck.
Katie then backed up and walked away in search of Galaxy.
She found her close to the apple tree talking to Pluto, Ali and Pursang.
"Kate, join us."
Galaxy said as soon as she spotted Katie.
"It's been quiet the day for you hasn't it?"
"In all honesty, it's been the most amazing day ever!
I do wish I could stay here with all of you."
Katie said sadly.
Pluto, Pursang and Galaxy exchanged worried gazes.
Galaxy knew Katie would want to stay, she was after all an orphan, yet they also knew that no human was allowed in Paradow, no matter what their circumstances, the chances of exposure was too great.
"What will happen now?"
Pursang asked.
"I'm not sure, Kate how will we get Hextia to your prison, I doubt we can orb her there."
"We will take her back to the orphanage, I will call the police and tell them everything."
"No you can't!"
Pluto said suddenly.
"My father is right Kate, please I beg of you, you cannot risk our exposure, there must be another way."
"Times have changed Galaxy, my people don't believe in unicorns anymore."
"Still, please we beg of you, you can't ever mention our existence to anyone please Kate."
"Alright, I won't, besides they'll only take one look at Hextia before throwing her in the loony bin.
People who dress like that, are usually regarded as mad especially if she talks of seeing unicorns and such."
Pluto, Pursang and Galaxy all raised their heads and pricked their ears.
"Oh no what if Hextia tells them about us, we can't stop her."
Galaxy uttered in a panicked tone.
Katie then lay her hand on Galaxy's wither.
"Trust me, times have changed, they won't believe her ranting on about magical creatures, but I do have a much better chance of convincing them that she kidnapped and tried to kill me.
Please you must trust me."
They looked at each other.
After a moment's pause and to everyone's surprise Pluto stepped forward.
"We trust you, it's settled then, at sunrise we will take both Katie and Hextia back to the orphanage and let Katie's authorities deal with Hextia."
With that said everyone nodded in agreement.
Around them darkness had fallen.
Katie gave a loud yawn, suddenly aware of how tired she was.
"Come along dear, it has been a very long day, let's get you tucked up.
Ali, please come with us, I need you to guard Kate tonight."
Galaxy said as they walked past the others back towards the fig tree.
Once there Galaxy lowered her horn to the ground.
A thick carpet of moss erupted from beneath her horn creating a soft bed.
Katie lay down on her back looking up at the sky.
The sun was gone and had been replaced by a thick black sky dotted with a few stars.
There was no smoke or fog in Paradow just a clear picturesque sky.
A large full moon was beaming down upon her, so close Katie felt she could almost reach up and touch it.
"Goodnight Galaxy."
Katie said curling herself into a ball before falling into a deep slumber.
"Night Kate."
Galaxy replied and smiled.
"I will check up on her later Ali."
Galaxy said and returned to the other unicorns and pegasi and mounted the podium.
"Listen up everyone, today has been a great success thanks to Katie.
However, I ask of you to be especially vigilant tonight, we will have to take shifts in guarding Hextia, the morning and her exile to prison is still far.
Till then we must be vigilant, she is still dangerous even without her powers."
The unicorns and Pegasus nickered in agreement.
"Pursang will you please take the first shift?"
Pursang replied by taking a deep bow in front of his queen, then he turned around and walked over to relieve Rex.
"Thank goodness this nightmare is nearly over."
Galaxy said to no one in particular, then continued over to Rex.
"Hey, are you alright?"
"Yes, but I can't help thinking off all the things that could have gone wrong today."
"True, but they didn't Rex, Katie broke Hextia' s crystal ball, the Gosli is safely stowed away and you have Belle back, stop fretting now, go and spend time with her."
"Are you sure?"
"Off course, my herd and I will manage."
"My pegasi thank you and will assist wherever they can."
"I know the will, thank you."
Galaxy said sincerely then returned to Ali.
"Thank you Ali, please go and rest, I will take over here."
Galaxy lay down beside Katie watching her sleep.
She felt torn, before her lay their saviour.
She had promised her anything, anything but staying with them.
How can I send her back to that awful place?</pre>
